NAME
       e2pall - convert all EPS files in a LaTeX document to PDF

SYNOPSIS
       e2pall TEXFILE

DESCRIPTION
       e2pall searches through TEXFILE for \includegraphics commands to find the base names of image files.  When it
       finds one, e2pall runs epstopdf(1) to create a PDF file from the EPS file.

       e2pall will check to be sure that an existing PDF file is up-to-date with the EPS  file,  and  will  not  run
       epstopdf(1) if the PDF file is newer than the EPS file.

BUGS
              Seems to be broken

              Cannot handle \input{filename} or \includegraphics{filename} split over more than one line

              Must be run from same directory as the LaTeX file

              Does not look down $TEXINPUTS

              Cannot handle documents that use \include commands

              Assumes all files included with \includegraphics are EPS files
