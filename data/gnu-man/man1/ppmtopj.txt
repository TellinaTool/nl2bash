NAME
       ppmtopj - convert a portable pixmap to an HP PaintJet file

SYNOPSIS
       ppmtopj   [-gamma   val]   [-xpos   val]   [-ypos   val]   [-back   dark|lite]   [-rle]   [-center]  [-render
       none|snap|bw|dither|diffuse|monodither|monodiffuse|clusterdither|monoclusterdither] [ppmfile]

DESCRIPTION
       Reads a portable pixmap as input and converts it into a format suitable to  be  printed  by  an  HP  PaintJet
       printer.

       For  best results, the input file should be in 8-color RGB form; i.e. it should have only the 8 binary combi‐
       nations of full-on and full-off primaries.  You could get this by sending the  input  file  through  ppmquant
       -map with a map file such as:
           P3
           8 1
           255
           0 0 0      255 0 0    0 255 0    0 0 255
           255 255 0  255 0 255  0 255 255  255 255 255
       Or else you could use use ppmdither -red 2 -green 2 -blue 2.

OPTIONS
       -rle          Run length encode the image.  (This can result in larger images)

       -back         Enhance  the  foreground by indicating if the background is light or dark compated to the fore‐
                     ground.

       -render alg   Use an internal rendering algorithm (default dither).

       -gamma int    Gamma correct the image using the integet parameter as a gamma (default 0).

       -center       Center the image to an 8.5 by 11 page

       -xpos pos     Move by pos pixels in the x direction.

       -ypos pos     Move by pos pixels in the y direction.

BUGS
       Most of the options have not been tested because of the price of the paper.
