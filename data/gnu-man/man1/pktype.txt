PKTYPE(1)                                      General Commands Manual                                     PKTYPE(1)



NAME
       pktype - verify and translate a packed font bitmap file to plain text

SYNOPSIS
       pktype pk_file[pk]

DESCRIPTION
       This  manual  page  is not meant to be exhaustive.  The complete documentation for this version of TeX can be
       found in the info file or manual Web2C: A TeX implementation.

       The pktype program translates a packed font file (pk) (output by, for  example,  gftopk(1)  to  a  file  that
       humans  can  read. It also serves as a pk file-validating program (i.e., if pktype can read it, it's correct)
       and as an example of a pk-reading program for other software that wants to read pk files.

       The input pk_file on the command line may omit the suffix `pk.  The plain text translation is always  written
       to standard output.

       The  output  file  gives a compact encoding of the packed encoding, using conventions described in the source
       code. Run lengths of black pixels alternate with parenthesized run lengths of white pixels, and brackets  are
       used to indicate when a row should be repeated.

ENVIRONMENT
       pktype looks for pk_file in the usual places according to Kpathsea.

       See tex(1) for the details of the searching.
