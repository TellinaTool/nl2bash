NAME
       intel_gpu_top - Display a top-like summary of Intel GPU usage

SYNOPSIS
       intel_gpu_top
       intel_gpu_top [ parameters ]

DESCRIPTION
       intel_gpu_top  is a tool to display usage information of an Intel GPU.  It requires root privilege to map the
       graphics device.

   Options
       -s [samples per second]
              number of samples to acquire per second

       -o [output file]
              collect usage statistics to [file]. If file is "-", run non-interactively  and  output  statistics  to
              stdout.

       -e ["command to profile"]
              execute  a  command,  and  leave when it is finished. Note that the entire command with all parameters
              should be included as one parameter.

       -h     show usage notes

EXAMPLES
       intel_gpu_top -o "cairo-trace-gvim.log" -s 100 -e "cairo-perf-trace /tmp/gvim"
              will run cairo-perf-trace with /tmp/gvim trace, non-interactively, saving the statistics  into  cairo-
              trace-gvim.log file, and collecting 100 samples per second.

       Note that idle units are not displayed, so an entirely idle GPU will only display the ring status and header.

BUGS
       Some  GPUs report some units as busy when they aren't, such that even when idle and not hung, it will show up
       as 100% busy.
