NAME
       diff3 - compare three files line by line

SYNOPSIS
       diff3 [OPTION]... MYFILE OLDFILE YOURFILE

DESCRIPTION
       Compare three files line by line.

       Mandatory arguments to long options are mandatory for short options too.

       -A, --show-all
              output all changes, bracketing conflicts

       -e, --ed
              output ed script incorporating changes from OLDFILE to YOURFILE into MYFILE

       -E, --show-overlap
              like -e, but bracket conflicts

       -3, --easy-only
              like -e, but incorporate only nonoverlapping changes

       -x, --overlap-only
              like -e, but incorporate only overlapping changes

       -X     like -x, but bracket conflicts

       -i     append `w' and `q' commands to ed scripts

       -m, --merge
              output actual merged file, according to -A if no other options are given

       -a, --text
              treat all files as text

       --strip-trailing-cr
              strip trailing carriage return on input

       -T, --initial-tab
              make tabs line up by prepending a tab

       --diff-program=PROGRAM
              use PROGRAM to compare files

       -L, --label=LABEL
              use LABEL instead of file name (can be repeated up to three times)

       --help display this help and exit

       -v, --version
              output version information and exit

       The default output format is a somewhat human-readable representation of the changes.

       The -e, -E, -x, -X (and corresponding long) options cause an ed script to be output instead of the default.

       Finally,  the  -m (--merge) option causes diff3 to do the merge internally and output the actual merged file.
       For unusual input, this is more robust than using ed.

       If a FILE is `-', read standard input.  Exit status is 0 if successful, 1 if conflicts, 2 if trouble.
