NAME
       session-migration - Migrate in user session settings.


SYNOPSIS
       session-migration [options]


DESCRIPTION
       The session-migration program can be used to migrate in-session user data when a program is evolving its con‐
       figuration, or needing to have files moved and so on. This program  is  generally  autostarted  at  the  very
       beginning of the session and integrates caching capabilities.

       The  general  usage is to ship an executable file in XDG_DATA_DIR/session-migration/scripts. This one will be
       executed the next time the user log into the session. It will executes all executable files  there  in  ascii
       order, one after another.

       Even  if the program tries to cache some timestamp and scripts to not be launched twiced (they are skipped on
       subsequent runs), the executables file should be idempotent.


OPTIONS
       --dry-run
              This parameter enables to run the session-migration tool without  really  launching  the  scripts  and
              marking them are migrated. It's generally used with --verbose for debugging purposes.


       --file filename
              This  parameter,  followed by a path or filename, tells sesions-migration to only consider that script
              file and ignoring XDG_DATA_DIR. It won't log as well this special file as being migrated.


       --help Display a quick command help.


       --verbose
              Show a lot of verbose information. It can be used by the user to debug configuration issues;
