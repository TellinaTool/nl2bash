DESCRIPTION
       rhythmbox  is  a  very  easy to use music playing and management program which supports a wide range of audio
       formats (including mp3 and ogg). Originally inspired by Apple's iTunes, the  current  version  also  supports
       Internet  Radio  and  Last.fm  integration,  iPod syncing and generic portable audio player support. Audio CD
       playback, ripping and encoding, music sharing, and Podcasts.
