SPEAKER-TEST(1)                                General Commands Manual                               SPEAKER-TEST(1)



NAME
       speaker-test - command-line speaker test tone generator for ALSA

SYNOPSIS
       speaker-test [-options]


DESCRIPTION
       speaker-test generates a tone that can be used to test the speakers of a computer.

       speaker-test  by default will test the default device. If you want to test another sound device you will have
       first to get a list of all of the sound cards in your system and the devices  associated  with  those  cards.
       Notice  that  there might be for example, one device for analog sound, one for digital sound and one for HDMI
       sound.  To get the list of available cards and devices you can run aplay -L.


       $ aplay -L
       null
           Discard all samples (playback) or generate zero samples (capture)
       default:CARD=ICH5
           Intel ICH5, Intel ICH5
           Default Audio Device
       front:CARD=ICH5,DEV=0
           Intel ICH5, Intel ICH5
           Front speakers
       surround40:CARD=ICH5,DEV=0
           Intel ICH5, Intel ICH5
           4.0 Surround output to Front and Rear speakers
       (...)


       in the above example, there are four devices listed: null, default, front and surround40. So, if you want  to
       test  the  last  device you can run speaker-test -Dsurround40:ICH5 -c 6. The -c option will indicate that the
       six audio channels in the device have to be tested.






OPTIONS
       -c | --channels NUM
              NUM channels in stream


       -D | --device NAME
              PCM device name NAME


       -f | --frequency FREQ
              sine wave of FREQ Hz


       --help Print usage help


       -b | --buffer TIME
              Use buffer size of TIME microseconds.  When 0 is given, use the  maximal  buffer  size.   The  default
              value is 0.


       -p | --period TIME
              Use  period  size of TIME microseconds.  When 0 is given, the periods given by -P option is used.  The
              default value is 0.


       -P | --nperiods PERIODS
              Use number of periods.  The default value is 4.


       -r | --rate RATE
              stream of RATE Hz


       -t | --test pink|sine|wav
              -t pink means use pink noise (default).

              Pink noise is perceptually uniform noise -- that is, it sounds like every frequency at once.   If  you
              can hear any tone it may indicate resonances in your speaker system or room.

              -t sine means to use sine wave.

              -t wav means to play WAV files, either pre-defined files or given via -w option.

              You can pass the number from 1 to 3 as a backward compatibility.


       -l | --nloops COUNT

              Specifies the number of loops.  Zero means to run infinitely.

              When  -s  option  below  with a valid channel is given, speaker-test will perform always a single-shot
              without looping.


       -s | --speaker CHANNEL
              Do a single-shot speaker test for the given channel.  The channel number starts from 1.   The  channel
              number  corresponds  to left, right, rear-left, rear-right, center, LFE, side-left, side-right, and so
              on.

              For example, when 1 is passed, it tests the left channel only once  rather  than  both  channels  with
              looping.


       -w | --wavfile
              Use the given WAV file for the playback instead of pre-defined WAV files.


       -W | --wavdir
              Specify the directory containing WAV files for playback.  The default path is /usr/share/sounds/alsa.


       -m | --chmap
              Pass the channel map to override.  If the playback in a specific channel order or channel positions is
              required, pass the channel position strings to this option.


USAGE EXAMPLES
       Produce stereo sound from one stereo jack:
         speaker-test -Dplug:front -c2

       Produce 4 speaker sound from two stereo jacks:
         speaker-test -Dplug:surround40 -c4

       Produce 5.1 speaker sound from three stereo jacks:
         speaker-test -Dplug:surround51 -c6

       To send a nice low 75Hz tone to the Woofer and then exit without touching any other speakers:
         speaker-test -Dplug:surround51 -c6 -s1 -f75

       To do a 2-speaker test using the spdif (coax or optical) output:
         speaker-test -Dplug:spdif -c2

       Play in the order of front-right and front-left from the front PCM
         speaker-test -Dplug:front -c2 -mFR,FL
