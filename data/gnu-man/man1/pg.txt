NAME
       pg - browse pagewise through text files

SYNOPSIS
       pg [-number] [-p string] [-cefnrs] [+line] [+/pattern/] [file...]

DESCRIPTION
       pg  displays  a  text file on a CRT one screenful at once.  After each page, a prompt is displayed.  The user
       may then either press the newline key to view the next page or one of the keys described below.

       If no filename is given on the command line, pg reads from standard input.  If standard output is not a  ter‐
       minal, pg acts like cat(1) but precedes each file with its name if there is more than one.

       If input comes from a pipe, pg stores the data in a buffer file while reading to make navigation possible.

OPTIONS
       pg accepts the following options:

       -number
              The number of lines per page.  Usually, this is the number of CRT lines minus one.

       -c     Clear  the  screen  before  a  page is displayed, if the terminfo entry for the terminal provides this
              capability.

       -e     Do not pause and display (EOF) at the end of a file.

       -f     Do not split long lines.

       -n     Without this option, commands must be terminated  by  a  newline  character.   With  this  option,  pg
              advances once a command letter is entered.

       -p string
              Instead  of  the normal prompt :, string is displayed.  If string contains %d, its first occurrence is
              replaced by the number of the current page.

       -r     Disallow the shell escape.

       -s     Print messages in standout mode, if the terminfo entry for the terminal provides this capability.

       +number
              Start at the given line.

       +/pattern/
              Start at the line containing the Basic Regular Expression pattern given.

USAGE
       The following commands may be entered at the prompt.  Commands preceded by i in this document accept a number
       as  argument,  positive  or negative.  If this argument starts with + or -, it is interpreted relative to the
       current position in the input file, otherwise relative to the beginning.

       i<newline>
              Display the next or the indicated page.

       id or ^D
              Display the next halfpage.  If i is given, it is always interpreted relative to the current position.

       il     Display the next or the indicated line.

       if     Skip a page forward.  i must be a positive number and is always interpreted relative  to  the  current
              position.

       iw or iz
              Behave as <newline> except that i becomes the new page size.

       . or ^L
              Redraw the screen.

       $      Advance to the last line of the input file.

       i/pattern/
              Search  forward  until  the  first  or  the i-th occurrence of the Basic Regular Expression pattern is
              found.  The search starts after the current page and stops at the end of the file.  No wrap-around  is
              performed.  i must be a positive number.

       i?pattern? or i^pattern^
              Search  backward  until  the  first  or the i-th occurrence of the Basic Regular Expression pattern is
              found.  The search starts before the current page and stops at the beginning of the  file.   No  wrap-
              around is performed.  i must be a positive number.

       The  search  commands accept an added letter.  If t is given, the line containing the pattern is displayed at
       the top of the screen, which is the default.  m selects the middle and b  the  bottom  of  the  screen.   The
       selected position is used in following searches, too.

       in     Advance to the next file or i files forward.

       ip     Reread the previous file or i files backward.

       s filename
              Save the current file to the given filename.

       h      Display a command summary.

       !command
              Execute command using the shell.

       q or Q Quit.

       If  the  user presses the interrupt or quit key while pg reads from the input file or writes on the terminal,
       pg will immediately display the prompt.  In all other situations these keys will terminate pg.
