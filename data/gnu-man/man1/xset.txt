DESCRIPTION
       This program is used to set various user preference options of the display.

OPTIONS
       -display display
               This option specifies the server to use; see X(7).

       b       The b option controls bell volume, pitch and duration.  This option accepts  up  to  three  numerical
               parameters, a preceding dash(-), or a 'on/off' flag.  If no parameters are given, or the 'on' flag is
               used, the system defaults will be used.  If the dash or 'off' are given, the bell will be turned off.
               If  only one numerical parameter is given, the bell volume will be set to that value, as a percentage
               of its maximum.  Likewise, the second numerical parameter specifies the bell pitch, in hertz, and the
               third  numerical  parameter  specifies  the duration in milliseconds.  Note that not all hardware can
               vary the bell characteristics.  The X server will set the characteristics of the bell as  closely  as
               it can to the user's specifications.

       bc      The  bc  option  controls bug compatibility mode in the server, if possible; a preceding dash(-) dis‐
               ables the mode, otherwise the mode is enabled.  Various pre-R4 clients pass illegal  values  in  some
               protocol  requests,  and  pre-R4  servers  did  not  correctly  generate errors in these cases.  Such
               clients, when run against an R4 server, will terminate abnormally or otherwise fail to  operate  cor‐
               rectly.   Bug compatibility mode explicitly reintroduces certain bugs into the X server, so that many
               such clients can still be run.  This mode should be  used  with  care;  new  application  development
               should  be done with this mode disabled.  The server must support the MIT-SUNDRY-NONSTANDARD protocol
               extension in order for this option to work.

       c       The c option controls key click.  This option can take an optional value, a preceding dash(-), or  an
               'on/off'  flag.   If no parameter or the 'on' flag is given, the system defaults will be used. If the
               dash or 'off' flag is used, keyclick will be disabled.  If a value from 0 to 100 is given, it is used
               to  indicate volume, as a percentage of the maximum.  The X server will set the volume to the nearest
               value that the hardware can support.

       -dpms   The -dpms option disables DPMS (Energy Star) features.

       +dpms   The +dpms option enables DPMS (Energy Star) features.

       dpms flags...
               The dpms option allows the DPMS (Energy Star) parameters to be set.  The option can take up to  three
               numerical  values, or the `force' flag followed by a DPMS state.  The `force' flags forces the server
               to immediately switch to the DPMS state specified.  The DPMS state can be  one  of  `standby',  `sus‐
               pend',  `off', or `on'.  When numerical values are given, they set the inactivity period (in units of
               seconds) before the three modes are activated.  The first value given is for the `standby' mode,  the
               second  is for the `suspend' mode, and the third is for the `off' mode.  Setting these values implic‐
               itly enables the DPMS features.  A value of zero disables a particular mode.

       fp= path,...
               The fp= sets the font path to the entries given in the path argument.  The entries are interpreted by
               the  server,  not  by  the  client.  Typically they are directory names or font server names, but the
               interpretation is server-dependent.

       fp default
               The default argument causes the font path to be reset to the server's default.

       fp rehash
               The rehash argument resets the font path to its current value, causing the server to reread the  font
               databases  in  the  current  font  path.  This is generally only used when adding new fonts to a font
               directory (after running mkfontdir to recreate the font database).

       -fp or fp-
               The -fp and fp- options remove elements from the current font path.   They  must  be  followed  by  a
               comma-separated list of entries.

       +fp or fp+
               This  +fp  and  fp+ options prepend and append elements to the current font path, respectively.  They
               must be followed by a comma-separated list of entries.

       led     The led option controls the keyboard LEDs.  This controls the turning on or off of one or all of  the
               LEDs.   It  accepts an optional integer, a preceding dash(-) or an 'on/off' flag.  If no parameter or
               the 'on' flag is given, all LEDs are turned on.  If a preceding dash or the flag 'off' is given,  all
               LEDs are turned off.  If a value between 1 and 32 is given, that LED will be turned on or off depend‐
               ing on the existence of a preceding dash.  ``xset led 3'' would turn led  #3  on.   ``xset  -led  3''
               would  turn it off.  The particular LED values may refer to different LEDs on different hardware.  If
               the X server supports the XKEYBOARD (XKB) extension, leds may be referenced by the XKB indicator name
               by  specifying  the `named' keyword and the indicator name.   For example, to turn on the Scroll Lock
               LED:

               xset led named "Scroll Lock"

       mouse   The m option controls the mouse parameters; it may be abbreviated to 'm'. Of course,  it  applies  to
               most  pointing  devices, not just mice. The parameters for the pointing device are `acceleration' and
               `threshold'. The acceleration can be specified as an integer, or as a simple fraction.  Threshold  is
               just  an  integer. The setting is applied to all connected pointing devices. xinput(1) should be used
               if you need device-specific settings.

       By default the pointer (the on-screen representation of the pointing device) will go `acceleration' times  as
       fast when the device travels more than `threshold' mickeys (i.e. would-be pixels) in 10 ms, including a small
       transition range. This way, the pointing device can be used for precise alignment when it  is  moved  slowly,
       yet  it  can be set to travel across the screen in a flick of the wrist when desired.  One or both parameters
       for the m option can be omitted, but if only one is given, it will be interpreted as the acceleration.  If no
       parameters or the flag 'default' is used, the system defaults will be set.

       If  the `threshold' parameter is provided and 0, the `acceleration' parameter will be used in the exponent of
       a more natural and continuous formula, giving precise control for slow motion but big reach for fast  motion,
       and a progressive transition for motions in between.  Recommended `acceleration' value in this case is 3/2 to
       3, but not limited to that range.

       In the X.org X Server 1.6 and above, the behaviour described so far is linked to the default  profile.  There
       are other profiles (i.e. functions determining pointer acceleration from device velocity) and additional set‐
       tings, so the above description may not apply to non-default cases. In the X.org Server 1.7, these are avail‐
       able as input device properties (see xinput).


       p       The  p option controls pixel color values.  The parameters are the color map entry number in decimal,
               and a color specification.  The root background colors may be changed on some servers by altering the
               entries  for BlackPixel and WhitePixel.  Although these are often 0 and 1, they need not be.  Also, a
               server may choose to allocate those colors privately, in which case an error will be generated.   The
               map entry must not be a read-only color, or an error will result.

       r       The  r  option  controls  the  autorepeat.   Invoking with "-r", or "r off", will disable autorepeat,
               whereas "r", or "r on" will enable autorepeat.  Following the "-r" or "r" option with an integer key‐
               code  between  0  and  255 will disable or enable autorepeat on that key respectively, but only if it
               makes sense for the particular keycode.  Keycodes below 8 are not typically valid for  this  command.
               Example: "xset -r 10" will disable autorepeat for the "1" key on the top row of an IBM PC keyboard.

               If  the  server supports the XFree86-Misc extension, or the XKB extension, then a parameter of 'rate'
               is accepted and should be followed by zero, one or two numeric values. The first specifies the  delay
               before  autorepeat starts and the second specifies the repeat rate.  In the case that the server sup‐
               ports the XKB extension, the delay is the number of milliseconds before autorepeat  starts,  and  the
               rate  is  the number of repeats per second.  If the rate or delay is not given, it will be set to the
               default value.

       s       The s option lets you set the screen saver parameters.  This  option  accepts  up  to  two  numerical
               parameters,  a 'blank/noblank' flag, an 'expose/noexpose' flag, an 'on/off' flag, an 'activate/reset'
               flag, or the 'default' flag.  If no parameters or the 'default' flag is used, the system will be  set
               to  its  default screen saver characteristics.  The 'on/off' flags simply turn the screen saver func‐
               tions on or off.  The 'activate' flag forces activation of screen saver even if the screen saver  had
               been  turned off.  The 'reset' flag forces deactivation of screen saver if it is active.  The 'blank'
               flag sets the preference to blank the video (if the hardware can do so) rather than display  a  back‐
               ground pattern, while 'noblank' sets the preference to display a pattern rather than blank the video.
               The 'expose' flag sets the preference to allow window exposures (the server can freely discard window
               contents),  while 'noexpose' sets the preference to disable screen saver unless the server can regen‐
               erate the screens without causing exposure events.  The length and period parameters for  the  screen
               saver function determines how long the server must be inactive for screen saving to activate, and the
               period to change the background pattern to avoid burn in.  The arguments are  specified  in  seconds.
               If only one numerical parameter is given, it will be used for the length.

       q       The q option gives you information on the current settings.

       -version
               The -version option prints the program version and exits without doing anything else.

       These settings will be reset to default values when you log out.

       Note that not all X implementations are guaranteed to honor all of these options.
