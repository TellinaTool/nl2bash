NAME
       min12xxw - Convert pbmraw streams to Minolta PagePro 12xxW languages

SYNOPSIS
       min12xxw [options]


DESCRIPTION
       Min12xxw is a filter which converts pbmraw streams (produced by ghostscript, for example) to the printer lan‐
       guage of Minolta PagePro 1[234]xxW printers.


COMMAND-LINE OPTIONS
       -h, --help
            Gives usage information (help)


       -v, --version
            Displays the version number and exit


       -e, --ecomode
            Enables economic mode which saves toner by leaving every other scanline blank. This degrades the  print‐
            out's  resolution a little, the effect is most easily seen (and looks particularly bad) when printing in
            300 dpi mode.


       -s, --status
            Query the printer status, page counter and whatever information can be retrieved. The printer status  is
            basically  an unprocessed dump of what the printer sends, so unexpected things may happen if the printer
            sends funny data because it got confused somehow... This might however still be useful. The page counter
            and  other  information  is  heavily  processed and should be more reliable. Note that for queries to be
            made, the printer must (of course) be switched on, with all cables connected, and not be  busy  printing
            (or  your  print  job may be truncated). See the -d option below which sets the device file to use. This
            has so far only been tested on 1200W, 1350W and 1400W printers. Send mail if  it  works  for  others  as
            well.


       -d dev, --device dev
            Sets the device file to use for queries. The default is /dev/lp0.

            Please  note  that  this  option is only meaningful with the "-s" or "--status" option. If you intend to
            send a document to the printer, you have to redirect min12xxw's standard output to the  device  file  in
            question. See the documentation that came with your shell on how to do that.


       -n, --nomargins
            Disables  the enforcement of the 0.17 inch margins on all sides of the paper. The converter discards the
            equivalent of this length of its input because ghostscript outputs a full  page  with  margins.  If  you
            arranged  in  some  way for the input to be marginless, or have slightly larger paper, you can give this
            option to include the full input with margins. Please note that for very small page dimensions, min12xxw
            might  need to disable enforcing the page margins for all pages following the offending page to make the
            job printable. In that case, a warning message will be printed on the standard error  stream  to  inform
            the user.


       -m model, --model model
            Sets which printer model to produce output for. Currently, no checks for features only available to spe‐
            cific models are made (available paper trays differ from model to model, for example). Let  me  know  if
            this  causes problems. Available models are: 1200W, 1250W, 1300W, 1350W, 1400W. 1200W is the default. As
            an alternative, you can also symlink, link or rename your executable to  min1200w,  min1250w,  min1300w,
            min1350w  or min1400w, thus making the model specified in the filename the default model. This saves you
            from typing the model selection option again and again and again...  Please note that  you  must  supply
            the  model option correctly if you drive any other model than what is the default. If you fail to do so,
            your printer will not produce any output or react to status queries from the host.


       -r resolution, --res resolution
            Sets the resolution to either 300, 600 or 1200 dpi (600 dpi is the default). Keep in mind that you  need
            to  produce your output accordingly. It is also possible to specify the resolution as (horizontal)x(ver‐
            tical) resolution (e.g. -r 1200x600) where horizontal resolution may be once or twice the vertical reso‐
            lution. The maximum resolution is 1200 dpi in both vertical and horizontal direction. The minimum verti‐
            cal resolution for mixed resolution printing seems to be 600 dpi. 300 dpi printing has only been  tested
            on  1200W,  1350W  and 1400W models. Mixed resolution printing was seen for 13xxW and 1400W models only,
            but tests show that the 1200W is capable of handling it as well, so  chances  are  that  1250W  printers
            won't have trouble, either.


       -t tray, --tray tray
            Sets  the  paper  tray to be used. Valid values for tray are "auto", "tray1", "tray2" and "manual", with
            "auto" being the default. Not all printer models have all sorts of paper trays. "auto" should be safe on
            all of them, I think. In fact, the PagePro 1400W seems to have only this kind of paper tray.


       -p type, --papertype type
            Sets  the type of paper used. Type can be one of "normal", "thick", "transparency", "envelope" or "post‐
            card". "normal" is the default.


       -f fmt, --paperformat fmt
            This sets the paper format to be used for the print job. The default value for fmt is "a4". Valid values
            are given below.

EXAMPLES
       gs  -q  -dBATCH  -dSAFER -dQUIET -dNOPAUSE -sPAPERSIZE=a4 -r1200 -sDEVICE=pbmraw -sOutputFile=- - < test.ps |
       min12xxw -r 1200 > test.min
            This would convert a postscript file test.ps to a file test.min which could  be  sent  directly  to  the
            printer, a 1200W to be exact. The output is rendered at 1200 dpi. If you have to drive some other model,
            see the model selection option (-m) above.


PORTABILITY
       Min12xxw should run on most *nix-like workstations without major problems. Library functions which are  known
       to  be  missing on non-Linux systems such as getline or getopt_long may have to be replaced by an appropriate
       substitute.  In case of getline and getopt_long this has already been done. The query options may or may  not
       work  on  other  systems, depending on the characteristics of the printer driver and the interface used (USB,
       very old style parallel port or a more recent one...).


BUGS/LIMITATIONS/CONTRIBUTORS
       Min12xxw was written without any documentation from the manufacturer. The description of the printer language
       may  be inaccurate or even wrong because it was obtained by looking at the output of the windoof driver only.
       The code dealing with the compression of raster data is in its spirit heavily based on an initial  driver  by
       Adam  Bocim  <beetman@seznam.cz>  who  managed to find out how things are done (thanks, Adam, you did a great
       job!).  This new version is considerably faster, implemented more cleanly and (hopefully) well documented.

       It also features querying the printer status and page  counter,  a  suggestion  made  by  Bruno  Schoedlbauer
       <bruno.schoedlbauer@gmx.de>,  who  also  pointed me to a nice USB sniffer by Benoit Papillault for Windoof 98
       and up, see http://benoit.papillault.free.fr/usbsnoop.  (That little program may prove very helpful on  simi‐
       lar occasions.  Happy USB sniffing...)

       David  Hamilton  <dhamilto@angel.homeip.net>  has  helped a lot in testing and developing the support for the
       PagePro 1350W.

       Even though this program has been designed with care and much thought, no-one can guarantee that this program
       will  not  damage  your  printer, computer or even your neighbour's car, because it was built without knowing
       exactly how things work, it's only a (hopefully) reasonable guess. (However, my printer does still work, even
       after  the  testing  phase  when  a  lot  of  wrong  stuff was sent to it. And my neighbour hasn't complained
       either...)

       Most of the available paper sizes have not actually been verified to work as advertised - reports about  suc‐
       cesses  or  problems  are welcome.  Also the code for querying the printer is not heavily tested. If you have
       comments to make or know more about the format than I do, please share your thoughts and your knowledge.

       13xxW series support seems to be relatively well tested by now. Send mail with feedback if you  have  such  a
       printer and you experience problems.

       1400W  support is pretty new - please send e-mail if it works or if you run into problems. Feedback on models
       for which support has just been completed is very important to improve and stabilise this support.

       Bugs and problems reports are generally welcome because I just don't have the time to test everything out.  I
       needed a filter and here it is. If it does not work - complain ;-)
