NAME
       clear - clear the terminal screen

SYNOPSIS
       clear

DESCRIPTION
       clear  clears your screen if this is possible, including its scrollback buffer (if the extended "E3" capabil‐
       ity is defined).  clear looks in the environment for the terminal type and then in the terminfo  database  to
       determine how to clear the screen.

       clear ignores any command-line parameters that may be present.
