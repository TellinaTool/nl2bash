NAME
       pamoil - turn a PAM image into an oil painting


SYNOPSIS
       pamoil [-n N] [pamfile]


DESCRIPTION
       Reads a Netpbm image as input.  Does an "oil transfer", and writes the same type of Netpbm image as output.

       The oil transfer is described in "Beyond Photography" by Holzmann, chapter 4, photo 7.  It's a sort of local‐
       ized smearing.

       The smearing works like this: First, assume a grayscale image.  For each pixel in the image, pamoil looks  at
       a  square neighborhood around it.  pamoil determines what is the most common pixel intensity in the neighbor‐
       hood, and puts a pixel of that intensity into the output in the same position as the input pixel.

       For color images, or any arbitrary multi-channel image, pamoil computes each channel (e.g.  red,  green,  and
       blue) separately the same way as the grayscale case above.

       At  the edges of the image, where the regular neighborhood would run off the edge of the image, pamoil uses a
       clipped neighborhood.


OPTIONS
       -n size
              This is the size of the neighborhood used in the smearing.  The neighborhood is this  many  pixels  in
              all four directions.

              The default is 3.
