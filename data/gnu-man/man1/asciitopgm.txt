NAME
       asciitopgm - convert ASCII graphics into a portable graymap

SYNOPSIS
       asciitopgm [-d divisor] height width [asciifile]

DESCRIPTION
       Reads  ASCII  data as input.  Produces a portable graymap with pixel values which are an approximation of the
       "brightness" of the ASCII characters, assuming black-on-white printing.  In other words, a capital M is  very
       dark,  a  period  is  ver light, and a space is white.  Input lines which are fewer than width characters are
       automatically padded with spaces.

       The divisor argument is a floating-point number by which the output pixels are divided; the default value  is
       1.0.   This can be used to adjust the brightness of the graymap: for example, if the image is too dim, reduce
       the divisor.

       In keeping with (I believe) Fortran line-printer conventions, input lines beginning with a + (plus) character
       are assumed to "overstrike" the previous line, allowing a larger range of gray values.

       This  tool  contradicts  the  message in the pbmtoascii manual: "Note that there is no asciitopbm tool - this
       transformation is one-way."

BUGS
       The table of ASCII-to-grey values is subject to interpretation, and,  of  course,  depends  on  the  typeface
       intended for the input.
