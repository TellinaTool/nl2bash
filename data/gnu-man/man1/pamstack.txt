NAME
       pamstack - stack planes of multiple PAM images into one PAM image

SYNOPSIS
       pamstack [-tupletype tupletype] [inputfilespec]

       All options may be abbreviated to the shortest unique prefix.


DESCRIPTION
       Reads  multiple  PAM  or  PNM  images  as input. Produces a PAM image as output, consisting of all the planes
       (channels) of the inputs, stacked in the order specified.

       The output is the same dimensions as the inputs, except that the depth is  the  sum  of  the  depths  of  the
       inputs. It has the same maxval.  pamstack fails if the inputs are not all the same width, height, and maxval.
       The tuple type is a null string unless you specify the -tupletype option.

       pamchannel does the opposite of pamstack: It extracts individual planes from a single PAM.

       Use pamtopnm to convert a suitable PAM image to a more traditional PNM (PBM, PGM, or PPM) image.

       One example of using pamstack is that some Netpbm programs accept as input  a  PAM  that  represents  graphic
       image  with  transparency  information -- tuple type "RGBA". In Netpbm, such images were traditionally repre‐
       sented as two images - a PPM for the color and a PGM for the transparency. To convert  a  PPM/PGM  pair  into
       PAM(RGBA) input that newer programs require, do something like this:

       pamstack -tupletype=RGBA myimage.ppm myalpha.pgm | pamtouil >myimage.uil


OPTIONS
       -tupletype tupletype
              This  specified  the  tuple  type  name to be recorded in the output. You may use any string up to 255
              characters. Some programs recognize some names. If you omit this option, the default tuple  type  name
              is null.
