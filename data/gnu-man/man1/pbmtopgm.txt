NAME
       pbmtopgm - convert portable bitmap to portable graymap by averaging areas


SYNOPSIS
       pbmtopgm width height [pbmfile]


DESCRIPTION
       pbmtopgm reads a portable bitmap as input.  It outputs a portable graymap in which each pixel's gray level is
       the average the surrounding black and white input pixels.  The surrounding area is a rectangle  of  width  by
       height pixels.

       In other words, this is a convolution.  pbmtopgm is similar to a special case of pnmconvol.

       You may need a ppmsmooth step after pbmtopgm.

       pbmtopgm has the effect of anti-aliasing bitmaps which contain distinct line features.

       pbmtopgm works best with odd sample width and heights.

       You  don't  need  pbmtopgm  just  to use a PGM program on a PBM image.  Any PGM program (assuming it uses the
       Netpbm libraries to read the PGM input) takes PBM input as if it were PGM, with only the mininum and  maximum
       gray levels.  So unless your convolution rectangle is bigger than one pixel, you're not gaining anything with
       a pbmtopgm step.
