NAME
       ionice - set or get process I/O scheduling class and priority

SYNOPSIS
       ionice [-c class] [-n level] [-t] -p PID...
       ionice [-c class] [-n level] [-t] command [argument...]

DESCRIPTION
       This program sets or gets the I/O scheduling class and priority for a program.  If no arguments or just -p is
       given, ionice will query the current I/O scheduling class and priority for that process.

       When command is given, ionice will run this command with the given arguments.  If no class is specified, then
       command will be executed with the "best-effort" scheduling class.  The default priority level is 4.

       As of this writing, a process can be in one of three scheduling classes:

       Idle   A  program  running with idle I/O priority will only get disk time when no other program has asked for
              disk I/O for a defined grace period.  The impact of an idle I/O  process  on  normal  system  activity
              should  be zero.  This scheduling class does not take a priority argument.  Presently, this scheduling
              class is permitted for an ordinary user (since kernel 2.6.25).

       Best-effort
              This is the effective scheduling class for any process that has not asked for a specific I/O priority.
              This  class  takes  a priority argument from 0-7, with a lower number being higher priority.  Programs
              running at the same best-effort priority are served in a round-robin fashion.

              Note that before kernel 2.6.26 a process that has not asked for an I/O priority formally  uses  "none"
              as  scheduling class, but the I/O scheduler will treat such processes as if it were in the best-effort
              class.  The priority within the best-effort class will be dynamically derived from the CPU nice  level
              of the process: io_priority = (cpu_nice + 20) / 5.

              For  kernels after 2.6.26 with the CFQ I/O scheduler, a process that has not asked for an I/O priority
              inherits its CPU scheduling class.  The I/O priority is derived from the CPU nice level of the process
              (same as before kernel 2.6.26).


       Realtime
              The  RT scheduling class is given first access to the disk, regardless of what else is going on in the
              system.  Thus the RT class needs to be used with some care, as it can starve other processes.  As with
              the  best-effort  class,  8  priority levels are defined denoting how big a time slice a given process
              will receive on each scheduling window.  This scheduling class is not permitted for an ordinary (i.e.,
              non-root) user.

OPTIONS
       -c, --class class
              Specify  the  name  or  number of the scheduling class to use; 0 for none, 1 for realtime, 2 for best-
              effort, 3 for idle.

       -n, --classdata level
              Specify the scheduling class data.  This only has an effect if the class  accepts  an  argument.   For
              realtime and best-effort, 0-7 are valid data (priority levels).

       -p, --pid PID...
              Specify the process IDs of running processes for which to get or set the scheduling parameters.

       -t, --ignore
              Ignore  failure  to  set the requested priority.  If command was specified, run it even in case it was
              not possible to set the desired scheduling priority, which can happen due to  insufficient  privileges
              or an old kernel version.

       -h, --help
              Display help and exit.

       -V, --version
              Display version information and exit.

EXAMPLES
       # ionice -c 3 -p 89

       Sets process with PID 89 as an idle I/O process.

       # ionice -c 2 -n 0 bash

       Runs 'bash' as a best-effort program with highest priority.

       # ionice -p 89 91

       Prints the class and priority of the processes with PID 89 and 91.

NOTES
       Linux supports I/O scheduling priorities and classes since 2.6.13 with the CFQ I/O scheduler.
