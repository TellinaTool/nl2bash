NAME
       xinput - utility to configure and test X input devices


SYNOPSIS
       xinput [OPTIONS] [DEVICE]


DESCRIPTION
       xinput is a utility to list available input devices, query information about a device and change input device
       settings.

OPTIONS
       --version
               Test if the X Input extension is available and return the version number of the program and the  ver‐
               sion supported by the server. This option does not require a device name.

       --list [--short || --long || --name-only || --id-only] [device]
               If no argument is given list all the input devices. If an argument is given, show all the features of
               device.  If --long is provided, the output includes detailed information about  the  capabilities  of
               each  devices.  Otherwise, or if --short is provided, only the device names and some minimal informa‐
               tion is listed.  If --name-only is provided, the output is limited to the device  names.  One  device
               name  is  listed  per line. Note that the order the devices are listed is undefined.  If --id-only is
               provided, the output is limited to the device IDs. One device ID is listed per line.  Note  that  the
               order the devices are listed is undefined.

       --get-feedbacks device
               Display the feedbacks of device.

       --set-pointer device
               Switch device in core pointer.  This option does nothing on X servers 1.5 and later.

       --set-mode device ABSOLUTE|RELATIVE
               Change the mode of device.

       --set-ptr-feedback device threshold num denom
               Change  the  pointer  acceleration (or feedback) parameters of device.  The xset(1) man page has more
               details. For X.Org Server 1.7 and above, there are additional device properties pertaining to pointer
               acceleration. These do not replace, but complement the pointer feedback setting.

       --set-integer-feedback device index value
               Change the value of an integer feedback of device.

       --set-button-map device map_button_1 [map_button_2 [...]]
               Change  the button mapping of device. The buttons are specified in physical order (starting with but‐
               ton 1) and are mapped to the logical button provided. 0 disables a button. The default button mapping
               for a device is 1 2 3 4 5 6 etc.

       --query-state device
               Query the device state.

       --list-props device [device [...]]
               Lists properties that can be set for the given device(s).

       --set-int-prop device property format value
               Sets  an  integer property for the device.  Appropriate values for format are 8, 16, or 32, depending
               on the property. Deprecated, use --set-prop instead.

       --set-float-prop device property value
               Sets a float property for the device. Deprecated, use --set-prop instead.

       --set-prop [--type=atom|float|int] [--format=8|16|32] device property value [...]
               Set the property to the given value(s).  If not specified, the format and type of  the  property  are
               left as-is.  The arguments are interpreted according to the property type.

       --watch-props device
               Prints to standard out when property changes occur.

       --delete-prop device property
               Delete the property from the device.

       --test [-proximity] device
               Register all extended events from device and enter an endless loop displaying events received. If the
               -proximity is given, ProximityIn and ProximityOut are registered.

       --test-xi2 [--root] [device]
               Register for a number of XI2 events and display them. If a device  is  given,  only  events  on  this
               device  are  displayed. If --root is given, events are selected on the root window only. Otherwise, a
               new client window is created (similar to xev).

       --create-master prefix [sendCore] [enable]
               Create a new pair of master devices on an XI2-enabled server with the given prefix. The  server  will
               create one master pointer named "prefix pointer" and one master keyboard named "prefix keyboard".  If
               sendCore is 1, this pair of master devices is set to send core events (default).   If  enable  is  1,
               this master device pair will be enabled immediately (default).

       --remove-master master [Floating|AttachToMaster] [returnPointer] [returnKeyboard]
               Remove  master   and its paired master device. Attached slave devices are set floating if Floating is
               specified or the argument is omitted.  If the second argument is AttachToMaster, returnPointer speci‐
               fies  the master pointer to attach all slave pointers to and returnKeyboard specifies the master key‐
               board to attach all slave keyboards to.

       --reattach slave master
               Reattach slave to master.

       --float slave
               Remove slave from its current master device.

       --set-cp window master
               Set the ClientPointer for the client owning window to master.  master must specify a master pointer.

       --map-to-output device crtc
               Restricts the movements of the absolute device to the RandR crtc. The output name must match  a  cur‐
               rently  connected  output  (see  xrandr(1)).  If the NVIDIA binary driver is detected or RandR 1.2 or
               later is not available, a Xinerama output may be specified as "HEAD-N", with  N  being  the  Xinerama
               screen number. This option has no effect on relative devices.

       --enable device
               Enable the device. This call is equivalent to xinput --set-prop device "Device Enabled" 1

       --disable device
               Disable the device. This call is equivalent to xinput --set-prop device "Device Enabled" 0

       device can be the device name as a string or the XID of the device.

       slave can be the device name as a string or the XID of a slave device.

       master can be the device name as a string or the XID of a master device.

       property can be the property as a string or the Atom value.
