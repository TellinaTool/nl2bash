WMDOCKER(1)                                    General Commands Manual                                   WMDOCKER(1)



NAME
       wmdocker - System tray for KDE3/GNOME2 docklet applications

SYNOPSIS
       wmdocker [options]

DESCRIPTION
       This manual page documents briefly the wmdocker command.  This manual page was written for the Debian distri‐
       bution because the original program does not have a manual page.

       wmdocker is a docking application (WindowMaker dock app) which acts as a system tray for KDE3 and GNOME2.  It
       can  be  used  to replace the panel in either environment, allowing you to have a system tray without running
       the KDE/GNOME panel.

       Docker was written and designed to work with Openbox 2, but it should work fine in any  window  manager  that
       supports WindowMaker dock apps.


OPTIONS
       -h-help
              Show summary of options.

       -display DISPLAY
              The X display to connect to.

       -border N
              The width of the border to put around the system tray icons. Defaults to 1.

       -vertical
              Line up the icons vertically. Defaults to horizontally.

       -wmaker
              WindowMaker  mode. This makes wmdocker a fixed size (64x64) to appear nicely in in WindowMaker.  Note:
              In this mode, you have a fixed number of icons that wmdocker can hold.

       -iconsize SIZE
              The size (width and height and height) to display icons as in the system tray. Defaults to 24.

       -color COLOR
              The background color to use for the tray. Defaults to whatever color the window manager specifies.
