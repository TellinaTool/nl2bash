COLRM(1)                                     BSD General Commands Manual                                    COLRM(1)

NAME
     colrm — remove columns from a file

SYNOPSIS
     colrm [start [stop]]

DESCRIPTION
     The colrm utility removes selected columns from the lines of a file.  A column is defined as a single character
     in a line.  Input is read from the standard input.  Output is written to the standard output.

     If only the start column is specified, columns numbered less than the start column will be written.  If both
     start and stop columns are specified, columns numbered less than the start column or greater than the stop col‐
     umn will be written.  Column numbering starts with one, not zero.

     Tab characters increment the column count to the next multiple of eight.  Backspace characters decrement the
     column count by one.

ENVIRONMENT
     The LANG, LC_ALL and LC_CTYPE environment variables affect the execution of colrm as described in environ(7).

EXIT STATUS
     The colrm utility exits 0 on success, and >0 if an error occurs.

SEE ALSO
     awk(1), column(1), cut(1), paste(1)
