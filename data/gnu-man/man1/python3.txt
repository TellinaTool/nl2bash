DESCRIPTION
       Python  is  an  interpreted, interactive, object-oriented programming language that combines remarkable power
       with very clear syntax.  For an introduction to programming in Python you are referred to  the  Python  Tuto‐
       rial.   The Python Library Reference documents built-in and standard types, constants, functions and modules.
       Finally, the Python Reference Manual describes the syntax and semantics of the core language in (perhaps too)
       much detail.  (These documents may be located via the INTERNET RESOURCES below; they may be installed on your
       system as well.)

       Python's basic power can be extended with your own modules written in C or C++.  On most systems such modules
       may be dynamically loaded.  Python is also adaptable as an extension language for existing applications.  See
       the internal documentation for hints.

       Documentation for installed Python modules and packages can be viewed by running the pydoc program.

COMMAND LINE OPTIONS
       -B     Don't write .py[co] files on import. See also PYTHONDONTWRITEBYTECODE.

       -b     Issue warnings about str(bytes_instance), str(bytearray_instance) and comparing  bytes/bytearray  with
              str. (-bb: issue errors)

       -c command
              Specify the command to execute (see next section).  This terminates the option list (following options
              are passed as arguments to the command).

       -d     Turn on parser debugging output (for wizards only, depending on compilation options).

       -E     Ignore environment variables like PYTHONPATH and PYTHONHOME that modify the  behavior  of  the  inter‐
              preter.

       -h ,  -? ,  --help
              Prints the usage for the interpreter executable and exits.

       -i     When  a script is passed as first argument or the -c option is used, enter interactive mode after exe‐
              cuting the script or the command.  It does not read the $PYTHONSTARTUP file.  This can  be  useful  to
              inspect global variables or a stack trace when a script raises an exception.

       -I     Run  Python  in isolated mode. This also implies -E and -S. In isolated mode sys.path contains neither
              the script’s directory nor the user’s site-packages directory. All PYTHON* environment  variables  are
              ignored, too.  Further restrictions may be imposed to prevent the user from injecting malicious code.

       -m module-name
              Searches sys.path for the named module and runs the corresponding .py file as a script.

       -O     Turn  on  basic optimizations.  This changes the filename extension for compiled (bytecode) files from
              .pyc to .pyo.  Given twice, causes docstrings to be discarded.

       -OO    Discard docstrings in addition to the -O optimizations.

       -q     Do not print the version and copyright messages. These messages are also suppressed in non-interactive
              mode.

       -s     Don't add user site directory to sys.path.

       -S     Disable  the  import  of  the  module  site  and  the site-dependent manipulations of sys.path that it
              entails.  Also disable these manipulations if site is explicitly imported later.

       -u     Force the binary I/O layers of stdout and stderr to be unbuffered.  stdin  is  always  buffered.   The
              text I/O layer will still be line-buffered.

       -v     Print  a  message  each  time a module is initialized, showing the place (filename or built-in module)
              from which it is loaded.  When given twice, print a message for each file that  is  checked  for  when
              searching for a module.  Also provides information on module cleanup at exit.

       -V ,  --version
              Prints the Python version number of the executable and exits.

       -W argument
              Warning  control.   Python  sometimes prints warning message to sys.stderr.  A typical warning message
              has the following form: file:line: category: message.  By default, each warning is  printed  once  for
              each  source  line where it occurs.  This option controls how often warnings are printed.  Multiple -W
              options may be given; when a warning matches more than one option, the action for  the  last  matching
              option  is  performed.   Invalid  -W  options  are ignored (a warning message is printed about invalid
              options when the first warning is issued).  Warnings can also be controlled from within a Python  pro‐
              gram using the warnings module.

              The  simplest  form  of  argument  is  one of the following action strings (or a unique abbreviation):
              ignore to ignore all warnings; default to explicitly request the default behavior (printing each warn‐
              ing once per source line); all to print a warning each time it occurs (this may generate many messages
              if a warning is triggered repeatedly for the same source line, such as inside a loop); module to print
              each  warning  only the first time it occurs in each module; once to print each warning only the first
              time it occurs in the program; or error to raise an exception instead of printing a warning message.

              The full form of argument is action:message:category:module:line.  Here, action is as explained  above
              but only applies to messages that match the remaining fields.  Empty fields match all values; trailing
              empty fields may be omitted.  The message field matches the start of the warning message printed; this
              match  is  case-insensitive.   The  category field matches the warning category.  This must be a class
              name; the match test whether the actual warning category of the message is a subclass of the specified
              warning  category.  The full class name must be given.  The module field matches the (fully-qualified)
              module name; this match is case-sensitive.  The line field matches the line number, where zero matches
              all line numbers and is thus equivalent to an omitted line number.

       -X option
              Set implementation specific option.

       -x     Skip  the first line of the source.  This is intended for a DOS specific hack only.  Warning: the line
              numbers in error messages will be off by one!

INTERPRETER INTERFACE
       The interpreter interface resembles that of the UNIX shell: when called with standard input  connected  to  a
       tty  device,  it  prompts  for  commands and executes them until an EOF is read; when called with a file name
       argument or with a file as standard input, it reads and executes a script from that file; when called with -c
       command,  it executes the Python statement(s) given as command.  Here command may contain multiple statements
       separated by newlines.  Leading whitespace is significant in Python statements!  In non-interactive mode, the
       entire input is parsed before it is executed.

       If  available,  the  script  name  and additional arguments thereafter are passed to the script in the Python
       variable sys.argv, which is a list of strings (you must first import sys to be able to  access  it).   If  no
       script  name  is  given, sys.argv[0] is an empty string; if -c is used, sys.argv[0] contains the string '-c'.
       Note that options interpreted by the Python interpreter itself are not placed in sys.argv.

       In interactive mode, the primary prompt is `>>>'; the second prompt (which appears when a command is not com‐
       plete) is `...'.  The prompts can be changed by assignment to sys.ps1 or sys.ps2.  The interpreter quits when
       it reads an EOF at a prompt.  When an unhandled exception occurs,  a  stack  trace  is  printed  and  control
       returns to the primary prompt; in non-interactive mode, the interpreter exits after printing the stack trace.
       The interrupt signal raises the KeyboardInterrupt exception; other UNIX signals are not caught  (except  that
       SIGPIPE is sometimes ignored, in favor of the IOError exception).  Error messages are written to stderr.

FILES AND DIRECTORIES
       These are subject to difference depending on local installation conventions; ${prefix} and ${exec_prefix} are
       installation-dependent and should be interpreted as for GNU software;  they  may  be  the  same.   On  Debian
       GNU/{Hurd,Linux} the default for both is /usr.

       ${exec_prefix}/bin/python
              Recommended location of the interpreter.

       ${prefix}/lib/python<version>
       ${exec_prefix}/lib/python<version>
              Recommended locations of the directories containing the standard modules.

       ${prefix}/include/python<version>
       ${exec_prefix}/include/python<version>
              Recommended  locations  of  the  directories containing the include files needed for developing Python
              extensions and embedding the interpreter.

ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES
       PYTHONHOME
              Change the location of the standard Python libraries.  By  default,  the  libraries  are  searched  in
              ${prefix}/lib/python<version>  and ${exec_prefix}/lib/python<version>, where ${prefix} and ${exec_pre‐
              fix} are installation-dependent directories, both defaulting to /usr/local.  When $PYTHONHOME  is  set
              to  a  single  directory,  its value replaces both ${prefix} and ${exec_prefix}.  To specify different
              values for these, set $PYTHONHOME to ${prefix}:${exec_prefix}.

       PYTHONPATH
              Augments the default search path for module files.  The format is the same as the shell's  $PATH:  one
              or  more directory pathnames separated by colons.  Non-existent directories are silently ignored.  The
              default search path is installation dependent, but generally begins with ${prefix}/lib/python<version>
              (see PYTHONHOME above).  The default search path is always appended to $PYTHONPATH.  If a script argu‐
              ment is given, the directory containing the script is inserted in the path in  front  of  $PYTHONPATH.
              The search path can be manipulated from within a Python program as the variable sys.path.

       PYTHONSTARTUP
              If this is the name of a readable file, the Python commands in that file are executed before the first
              prompt is displayed in interactive mode.  The file is executed in the same name space  where  interac‐
              tive commands are executed so that objects defined or imported in it can be used without qualification
              in the interactive session.  You can also change the prompts sys.ps1 and sys.ps2 in this file.

       PYTHONOPTIMIZE
              If this is set to a non-empty string it is equivalent to specifying the -O option. If set to an  inte‐
              ger, it is equivalent to specifying -O multiple times.

       PYTHONDEBUG
              If  this is set to a non-empty string it is equivalent to specifying the -d option. If set to an inte‐
              ger, it is equivalent to specifying -d multiple times.

       PYTHONDONTWRITEBYTECODE
              If this is set to a non-empty string it is equivalent to specifying the -B option (don't try to  write
              .py[co] files).

       PYTHONINSPECT
              If this is set to a non-empty string it is equivalent to specifying the -i option.

       PYTHONIOENCODING
              If this is set before running the interpreter, it overrides the encoding used for stdin/stdout/stderr,
              in the syntax encodingname:errorhandler The errorhandler part is optional and has the same meaning  as
              in str.encode. For stderr, the errorhandler
               part is ignored; the handler will always be ´backslashreplace´.

       PYTHONNOUSERSITE
              If  this is set to a non-empty string it is equivalent to specifying the -s option (Don't add the user
              site directory to sys.path).

       PYTHONUNBUFFERED
              If this is set to a non-empty string it is equivalent to specifying the -u option.

       PYTHONVERBOSE
              If this is set to a non-empty string it is equivalent to specifying the -v option. If set to an  inte‐
              ger, it is equivalent to specifying -v multiple times.

       PYTHONWARNINGS
              If this is set to a comma-separated string it is equivalent to specifying the -W option for each sepa‐
              rate value.

       PYTHONHASHSEED
              If this variable is set to "random", a random value is used to seed the hashes of str, bytes and date‐
              time objects.

              If  PYTHONHASHSEED is set to an integer value, it is used as a fixed seed for generating the hash() of
              the types covered by the hash randomization.  Its purpose is to allow repeatable hashing, such as  for
              selftests for the interpreter itself, or to allow a cluster of python processes to share hash values.

              The integer must be a decimal number in the range [0,4294967295].  Specifying the value 0 will disable
              hash randomization.
