ppmtopgm(1)                                    General Commands Manual                                   ppmtopgm(1)



NAME
       ppmtopgm - convert a portable pixmap into a portable graymap

SYNOPSIS
       ppmtopgm [ppmfile]

DESCRIPTION
       Reads  a portable pixmap as input.  Produces a portable graymap as output.  The output is a "black and white"
       rendering of the original image, as in a black and white photograph.  The quantization formula used is .299 r
       + .587 g + .114 b.

       Note  that although there is a pgmtoppm program, it is not necessary for simple conversions from pgm to ppm ,
       because any ppm program can read pgm (and pbm ) files automatically.  pgmtoppm is for colorizing a pgm  file.
       Also, see ppmtorgb3 for a different way of converting color to gray.  And ppmdist generates a grayscale image
       from a color image, but in a way that makes it easy to differentiate the original colors, not  necessarily  a
       way that looks like a black and white photograph.


QUOTE
       Cold-hearted orb that rules the night
       Removes the colors from our sight
       Red is gray, and yellow white
       But we decide which is right
       And which is a quantization error.
