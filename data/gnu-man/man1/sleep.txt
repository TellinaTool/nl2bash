SLEEP(1)                                            User Commands                                           SLEEP(1)



NAME
       sleep - delay for a specified amount of time

SYNOPSIS
       sleep NUMBER[SUFFIX]...
       sleep OPTION

DESCRIPTION
       Pause for NUMBER seconds.  SUFFIX may be 's' for seconds (the default), 'm' for minutes, 'h' for hours or 'd'
       for days.  Unlike most implementations that require NUMBER be an integer, here NUMBER  may  be  an  arbitrary
       floating  point  number.   Given  two or more arguments, pause for the amount of time specified by the sum of
       their values.
