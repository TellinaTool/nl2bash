NAME
       dpkg-name - rename Debian packages to full package names

SYNOPSIS
       dpkg-name [option...]  [--] file...

DESCRIPTION
       This  manual  page  documents the dpkg-name program which provides an easy way to rename Debian packages into
       their full package names. A full package name consists of package_version_architecture.package-type as speci‐
       fied  in  the  control file of the package. The version part of the filename consists of the upstream version
       information optionally followed by a hyphen and the revision information. The package-type  part  comes  from
       that field if present or fallbacks to deb.

OPTIONS
       -a, --no-architecture
              The destination filename will not have the architecture information.

       -k, --symlink
              Create a symlink, instead of moving.

       -o, --overwrite
              Existing files will be overwritten if they have the same name as the destination filename.

       -s, --subdir [dir]
              Files  will  be moved into a subdirectory. If the directory given as argument exists the files will be
              moved into that directory otherwise the name of the target directory is  extracted  from  the  section
              field  in  the  control  part  of the package. The target directory will be `unstable/binary-architec‐
              ture/section'. If the section is not found in the control, then `no-section' is assumed, and  in  this
              case,  as well as for sections `non-free' and `contrib' the target directory is `section/binary-archi‐
              tecture'. The section field isn't required so a lot of packages will find their way  to  the  `no-sec‐
              tion' area. Use this option with care, it's messy.

       -c, --create-dir
              This option can used together with the -s option. If a target directory isn't found it will be created
              automatically.  Use this option with care.

       -?, --help
              Show the usage message and exit.

       -v, --version
              Show the version and exit.

BUGS
       Some packages  don't  follow  the  name  structure  package_version_architecture.deb.   Packages  renamed  by
       dpkg-name  will  follow  this  structure. Generally this will have no impact on how packages are installed by
       dselect(1)/dpkg(1), but other installation tools might depend on this naming structure.

EXAMPLES
       dpkg-name bar-foo.deb
              The file `bar-foo.deb' will be renamed to bar-foo_1.0-2_i386.deb or something  similar  (depending  on
              whatever information is in the control part of `bar-foo.deb').

       find /root/debian/ -name '*.deb' | xargs -n 1 dpkg-name -a
              All  files  with  the  extension  `deb'  in  the directory /root/debian and its subdirectory's will be
              renamed by dpkg-name if required into names with no architecture information.

       find -name '*.deb' | xargs -n 1 dpkg-name -a -o -s -c
              Don't do this.  Your archive will be messed up completely because a lot of packages  don't  come  with
              section information.  Don't do this.

       dpkg-deb --build debian-tmp && dpkg-name -o -s .. debian-tmp.deb
              This can be used when building new packages.
