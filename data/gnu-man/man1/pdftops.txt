NAME
       pdftops - Portable Document Format (PDF) to PostScript converter (version 3.03)

SYNOPSIS
       pdftops [options] <PDF-file> [<PS-file>]

DESCRIPTION
       Pdftops converts Portable Document Format (PDF) files to PostScript so they can be printed.

       Pdftops  reads  the  PDF file, PDF-file, and writes a PostScript file, PS-file.  If PS-file is not specified,
       pdftops converts file.pdf to file.ps (or file.eps with the -eps option).  If PS-file is ´-',  the  PostScript
       is sent to stdout.

OPTIONS
       -f number
              Specifies the first page to print.

       -l number
              Specifies the last page to print.

       -level1
              Generate  Level  1  PostScript.   The resulting PostScript files will be significantly larger (if they
              contain images), but will print on Level 1 printers.  This also  converts  all  images  to  black  and
              white.   No  more  than one of the PostScript level options (-level1, -level1sep, -level2, -level2sep,
              -level3, -level3sep) may be given.

       -level1sep
              Generate Level 1 separable PostScript.  All colors are converted to CMYK.   Images  are  written  with
              separate stream data for the four components.

       -level2
              Generate  Level  2  PostScript.   Level  2  supports  color images and image compression.  This is the
              default setting.

       -level2sep
              Generate Level 2 separable PostScript.  All colors are converted to CMYK.  The  PostScript  separation
              convention operators are used to handle custom (spot) colors.

       -level3
              Generate Level 3 PostScript.  This enables all Level 2 features plus CID font embedding.

       -level3sep
              Generate Level 3 separable PostScript.  The separation handling is the same as for -level2sep.

       -origpagesizes
              Generate a PostScript file with variable page sizes and orientations, taking for each page the size of
              the original page in the PDF file.  The PostScript file contains "<</PageSize  [WIDTH  HEIGHT]>>  set‐
              pagedevice"  lines  in  each  page  header, so that the paper input tray gets correctly changed on the
              printer. This option should be used when pdftops is used as a print filter. Any specification  of  the
              page size via -paper, -paperw, or -paperh will get overridden as long as each page of the PDF file has
              a defined paper size.  No more than one of the mode  options  (-origpagesizes,  -eps,  -form)  may  be
              given.

       -eps   Generate  an  Encapsulated  PostScript (EPS) file.  An EPS file contains a single image, so if you use
              this option with a multi-page PDF file, you must use -f and -l to specify a single page.  No more than
              one of the mode options (-origpagesizes, -eps, -form) may be given.

       -form  Generate  a PostScript form which can be imported by software that understands forms.  A form contains
              a single page, so if you use this option with a multi-page PDF file, you must use -f and -l to specify
              a  single  page.   The -level1 option cannot be used with -form.  No more than one of the mode options
              (-origpagesizes, -eps, -form) may be given.

       -opi   Generate OPI comments for all images and forms which have  OPI  information.   (This  option  is  only
              available if pdftops was compiled with OPI support.)

       -binary
              Write binary data in Level 1 PostScript.  By default, pdftops writes hex-encoded data in Level 1 Post‐
              Script.  Binary data is non-standard in Level 1 PostScript but reduces the file size and can be useful
              when Level 1 PostScript is required only for its restricted use of PostScript operators.

       -r number
              Set  the  resolution  in  DPI when pdftops rasterizes images with transparencies or, for Level 1 Post‐
              Script, when pdftops rasterizes images with color masks.  By default, pdftops rasterizes images to 300
              DPI.

       -noembt1
              By  default,  any Type 1 fonts which are embedded in the PDF file are copied into the PostScript file.
              This option causes pdftops to substitute base fonts instead.  Embedded  fonts  make  PostScript  files
              larger, but may be necessary for readable output.

       -noembtt
              By default, any TrueType fonts which are embedded in the PDF file are copied into the PostScript file.
              This option causes pdftops to substitute base fonts instead.  Embedded  fonts  make  PostScript  files
              larger,  but  may  be  necessary  for readable output.  Also, some PostScript interpreters do not have
              TrueType rasterizers.

       -noembcidps
              By default, any CID PostScript fonts which are embedded in the PDF file are copied into the PostScript
              file.   This  option  disables  that embedding.  No attempt is made to substitute for non-embedded CID
              PostScript fonts.

       -noembcidtt
              By default, any CID TrueType fonts which are embedded in the PDF file are copied into  the  PostScript
              file.   This  option  disables  that embedding.  No attempt is made to substitute for non-embedded CID
              TrueType fonts.

       -passfonts
              By default, references to non-embedded 8-bit fonts in the PDF file are substituted  with  the  closest
              "Helvetica",  "Times-Roman",  or  "Courier" font.  This option passes references to non-embedded fonts
              through to the PostScript file.

       -preload
              preload images and forms

       -paper size
              Set the paper size to one of "letter", "legal", "A4", or "A3".  This can also be set to "match", which
              will  set  the  paper  size to match the size specified in the PDF file. -origpagesizes overrides this
              setting if the PDF file has defined page sizes.

       -paperw size
              Set the paper width, in points. -origpagesizes overrides this setting if the PDF file has defined page
              sizes.

       -paperh size
              Set  the  paper  height,  in points. -origpagesizes overrides this setting if the PDF file has defined
              page sizes.

       -nocrop
              By default, output is cropped to the CropBox specified in the PDF file.  This  option  disables  crop‐
              ping.

       -expand
              Expand PDF pages smaller than the paper to fill the paper.  By default, these pages are not scaled.

       -noshrink
              Don't  scale  PDF  pages which are larger than the paper.  By default, pages larger than the paper are
              shrunk to fit.

       -nocenter
              By default, PDF pages smaller than the paper (after any scaling) are  centered  on  the  paper.   This
              option causes them to be aligned to the lower-left corner of the paper instead.

       -duplex
              Set  the Duplex pagedevice entry in the PostScript file.  This tells duplex-capable printers to enable
              duplexing.

       -opw password
              Specify the owner password for the PDF file.  Providing this will bypass all security restrictions.

       -upw password
              Specify the user password for the PDF file.

       -q     Don't print any messages or errors.

       -v     Print copyright and version information.

       -h     Print usage information.  (-help and --help are equivalent.)

EXIT CODES
       The Xpdf tools use the following exit codes:

       0      No error.

       1      Error opening a PDF file.

       2      Error opening an output file.

       3      Error related to PDF permissions.

       99     Other error.
