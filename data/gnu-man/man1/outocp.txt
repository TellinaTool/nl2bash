NAME
       outocp - debug an OCP file

SYNOPSIS
       outocp OCPFILE[.ocp]

DESCRIPTION
       outocp  is  used  for debugging Omega Compiled Translation Process (OCP) files.  It generates some statistics
       about the OCP file, and then runs through the states that the file defines.

       Omega Translation Processes are rules used to translate one character set to another and  to  choose  between
       characters  with  one  or  more  context-sensitive  variants.   OTPs could also be used to change the case or
       hyphenation of text.

BUGS
       None known, but report any found to <omega@ens.fr> (mailing list).
