CWEB(1)                                        General Commands Manual                                       CWEB(1)



NAME
       ctangle, cweave - translate CWEB to C and/or TeX

SYNOPSIS
       ctangle [-bhp] [+s] webfile[.w] [{changefile[.ch]|-} [outfile[.c]]]
       cweave [-befhpx] [+s] webfile[.w] [{changefile[.ch]|-} [outfile[.tex]]]

DESCRIPTION
       The  ctangle  program converts a CWEB source document into a C program that may be compiled in the usual way.
       The output file includes #line specifications so that debugging can be done in terms of the CWEB source file.

       The cweave program converts the same CWEB file into a TeX file that may be formatted and printed in the usual
       way.   It takes appropriate care of typographic details like page layout and the use of indentation, italics,
       boldface, etc., and it supplies extensive cross-index information that it gathers automatically.

       CWEB allows you to prepare a single document containing all the information that is needed both to produce  a
       compilable C program and to produce a well-formatted document describing the program in as much detail as the
       writer may desire.  The user of CWEB ought to be familiar with TeX as well as C.

       The command line should have one, two, or three names on it.  The first is taken as the CWEB file (and .w  is
       added if there is no extension).  If that file cannot be opened, the extension .web is tried instead. (But .w
       is recommended, since .web usually implies Pascal.)  If there is a second name, it is a change file (and  .ch
       is  added  if  there  is no extension).  The change file overrides parts of the WEB file, as described in the
       documentation.  If there is a third name, it overrides the default name of the output file, which is ordinar‐
       ily the same as the name of the input file (but on the current directory) with the extension .c or .tex.

       Options  in  the command line may be either turned off with - (if they are on by default) or turned on with +
       (if they are off by default).  In fact, the options are processed from left to  right,  so  a  sequence  like
       -f +f corresponds to +f (which is the default).

       The  -b  option  suppresses  the  banner  line  that normally appears on your terminal when ctangle or cweave
       begins.  The -h option suppresses the happy message that normally appears if the processing  was  successful.
       The -p option suppresses progress reports (starred module numbers) as the processing takes place.  If you say
       -bhp, you get nothing but error messages.

       The +s option prints statistics about memory usage at the end of a run (assuming that the programs have  been
       compiled with the -DSTAT switch).

       There  are  three other options applicable to cweave only: -f means do not force a newline after every state‐
       ment in the formatted output.  -e inhibits the enclosure  of  C material  formatted  by  cweave  in  brackets
       \PB{...}.   Such  brackets  are normally inserted so that special hooks can be used by cweb-latex and similar
       programs.  -x means omit the index and table of contents.

ENVIRONMENT
       The environment variable CWEBINPUTS is used to search for the input files, or the system default  if  CWEBIN‐
       PUTS is not set.  See tex(1) for the details of the searching.

FILES
       The  location  of  the files mentioned below varies from system to system.  Use the kpsewhich utility to find
       their locations.

       cwebmac.tex
              TeX macros used by cweave output.

       cwebman.tex
              The user manual.

AUTHORS
       Don Knuth wrote WEB for TeX and Pascal.  Silvio Levy designed and developed CWEB by adapting the WEB  conven‐
       tions  to C  and  by recoding everything in CWEB.  Knuth began using CWEB and made further refinements.  Many
       other helpers are acknowledged in the CWEB manual.
