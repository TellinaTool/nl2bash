NAME
       pdfpun - n-up the pages of a pdf file, with right-to-left ordering

SYNOPSIS
       pdfpun SRC [PAGESPEC] --outfile FILENAME [OPTION [OPTION] ...]

DESCRIPTION
       pdfpun converts a file in the Adobe Portable Document Format (PDF) to a "n-up" PDF file, that is, with multi‐
       ple input pages per output page, for more economical printing etc.  The pages are  ordered  right-to-left  in
       the  output.   The  default  processing is to 2-up landscape output with no frame around pages, equivalent to
       using the options '--nup 2x1 --landscape --frame false'.

       SRC must be a PDF file; '/dev/stdin' can be used for PDF input via a pipeline.

       If PAGESPEC is omitted, all pages are processed (equivalent to '-' as PAGESPEC)

       OPTION is any option of pdfjam(1) other than --batch.

       pdfpun is a simple wrapper for pdfjam, which provides a front end to many of the capabilities of the pdfpages
       package for pdflatex.  A working installation of pdflatex, with the pdfpages package, is required.

       pdfpun is part of the "PDFjam" package of tools, whose homepage is at http://www.warwick.ac.uk/go/pdfjam.
