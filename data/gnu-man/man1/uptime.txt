NAME
       uptime - Tell how long the system has been running.

SYNOPSIS
       uptime [options]

DESCRIPTION
       uptime gives a one line display of the following information.  The current time, how long the system has been
       running, how many users are currently logged on, and the system load averages for the past 1, 5, and 15  min‐
       utes.

       This is the same information contained in the header line displayed by w(1).

       System  load  averages  is  the  average number of processes that are either in a runnable or uninterruptable
       state.  A process in a runnable state is either using the CPU or waiting to use the CPU.  A process in  unin‐
       terruptable state is waiting for some I/O access, eg waiting for disk.  The averages are taken over the three
       time intervals.  Load averages are not normalized for the number of CPUs in a system, so a load average of  1
       means  a  single  CPU  system  is loaded all the time while on a 4 CPU system it means it was idle 75% of the
       time.
