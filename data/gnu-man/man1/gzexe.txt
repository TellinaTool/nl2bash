GZEXE(1)                                       General Commands Manual                                      GZEXE(1)



NAME
       gzexe - compress executable files in place

SYNOPSIS
       gzexe name ...

DESCRIPTION
       The gzexe utility allows you to compress executables in place and have them automatically uncompress and exe‐
       cute when you run them (at a penalty in performance).  For example if you execute ``gzexe  /usr/bin/gdb''  it
       will create the following two files:
           -rwxr-xr-x  1 root root 1026675 Jun  7 13:53 /usr/bin/gdb
           -rwxr-xr-x  1 root root 2304524 May 30 13:02 /usr/bin/gdb~
       /usr/bin/gdb~  is  the  original  file  and  /usr/bin/gdb is the self-uncompressing executable file.  You can
       remove /usr/bin/gdb~ once you are sure that /usr/bin/gdb works properly.

       This utility is most useful on systems with very small disks.

OPTIONS
       -d     Decompress the given executables instead of compressing them.

SEE ALSO
       gzip(1), znew(1), zmore(1), zcmp(1), zforce(1)

CAVEATS
       The compressed executable is a shell script.  This may create some security holes.  In particular,  the  com‐
       pressed  executable  relies  on the PATH environment variable to find gzip and some standard utilities (base‐
       name, chmod, ln, mkdir, mktemp, rm, sleep, and tail).

BUGS
       gzexe attempts to retain the original file attributes on the compressed executable, but you may have  to  fix
       them manually in some cases, using chmod or chown.
