NAME
       pdf270 - rotate the pages of pdf files

SYNOPSIS
       pdf270 [OPTION [OPTION] ...] [SRC [PAGESPEC] [SRC [PAGESPEC]] ...]

DESCRIPTION
       pdf270 rotates the pages of files in the Adobe Portable Document Format (PDF) through 90 degrees (clockwise).

       If no source PDF file ('SRC') is specified, input is from /dev/stdin. If 'PAGESPEC' is omitted, all pages are
       processed.

       Source files are processed sequentially into a single output unless the '--batch' option is  used,  in  which
       case they are processed separately.

       pdf270 operates on one or more PDF files, and (either with the '--batch' option or with '--outfile DIR' where
       'DIR' is a directory) the resulting files have the suffix 'rotated270' applied to their names by default.  To
       change the suffix, use the '--suffix' option, for example

              pdf270 --suffix '-turned' --batch myfile1.pdf myfile2.pdf

       will result in files named 'myfile1-turned.pdf' and 'myfile2-turned.pdf'.

       pdf270 is a simple wrapper for pdfjam, which is a front end to many of the capabilities of the pdfpages pack‐
       age for pdflatex.  A working installation of pdflatex with the pdfpages package is required.

       pdf270 is part of the "PDFjam" package of tools, whose homepage is at http://go.warwick.ac.uk/pdfjam.
