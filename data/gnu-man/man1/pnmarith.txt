NAME
       pnmarith - perform arithmetic on two portable anymaps

SYNOPSIS
       pnmarith -add|-subtract|-multiply|-difference|-minimum|-maximum.  pnmfile1 pnmfile2

DESCRIPTION
       Reads  two  portable  anymaps as input.  Performs the specified arithmetic operation, and produces a portable
       anymap as output.  The two input anymaps must be the same width and height.

       The arithmetic is performed between corresponding pixels in the two anymaps, as if maxval was 1.0, black  was
       0.0, and a linear scale in between.  Results that fall outside of [0..1) are truncated.

       The operator -difference calculates the absolute value of pnmarith -subtract pnmfile1 pnmfile2, i.e. no trun‐
       cation is done.

       All flags can be abbreviated to their shortest unique prefix.
