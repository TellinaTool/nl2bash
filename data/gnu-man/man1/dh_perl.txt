NAME
       dh_perl - calculates Perl dependencies and cleans up after MakeMaker

SYNOPSIS
       dh_perl [debhelper options] [-d] [library dirs ...]

DESCRIPTION
       dh_perl is a debhelper program that is responsible for generating the ${perl:Depends} substitutions and
       adding them to substvars files.

       The program will look at Perl scripts and modules in your package, and will use this information to generate
       a dependency on perl or perlapi. The dependency will be substituted into your package's control file wherever
       you place the token ${perl:Depends}.

       dh_perl also cleans up empty directories that MakeMaker can generate when installing Perl modules.

OPTIONS
       -d  In some specific cases you may want to depend on perl-base rather than the full perl package. If so, you
           can pass the -d option to make dh_perl generate a dependency on the correct base package. This is only
           necessary for some packages that are included in the base system.

           Note that this flag may cause no dependency on perl-base to be generated at all. perl-base is Essential,
           so its dependency can be left out, unless a versioned dependency is needed.

       -V  By default, scripts and architecture independent modules don't depend on any specific version of perl.
           The -V option causes the current version of the perl (or perl-base with -d) package to be specified.

       library dirs
           If your package installs Perl modules in non-standard directories, you can make dh_perl check those
           directories by passing their names on the command line. It will only check the vendorlib and vendorarch
           directories by default.
