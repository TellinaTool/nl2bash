LESSOPEN(1)                                    General Commands Manual                                   LESSOPEN(1)



NAME
       lessfile, lesspipe - "input preprocessor" for  less.

SYNOPSIS
       lessfile, lesspipe

DESCRIPTION
       This manual page documents briefly the lessfile, and lesspipe commands.  This manual page was written for the
       Debian GNU/Linux distribution because the input preprocessor scripts are provided by Debian GNU/Linux and are
       not part of the original program.

       lessfile and lesspipe are programs that can be used to modify the way the contents of a file are displayed in
       less.  What this means is that less can automatically open up tar files, uncompress gzipped files,  and  even
       display something reasonable for graphics files.

       lesspipe  will toss the contents/info on STDOUT and less will read them as they come across.  This means that
       you do not have to wait for the decoding to finish before less shows you the file.  This also means that  you
       will  get  a 'byte N' instead of an N% as your file position.  You can seek to the end and back to get the N%
       but that means you have to wait for the pipe to finish.

       lessfile will toss the contents/info on a file which less will then read.  After you are done, lessfile  will
       then delete the file.  This means that the process has to finish before you see it, but you get nice percent‐
       ages (N%) up front.

USAGE
       Just put one of the following two commands in your login script (e.g.  ~/.bash_profile):

         eval "$(lessfile)"

       or

         eval "$(lesspipe)"

FILE TYPE RECOGNITION
       File types are recognized by their extensions.  This is a list of currently supported extensions (grouped  by
       the programs that handle them):

         *.a
         *.arj
         *.tar.bz2
         *.bz
         *.bz2
         *.deb, *.udeb, *.ddeb
         *.doc
         *.gif, *.jpeg, *.jpg, *.pcd, *.png, *.tga, *.tiff, *.tif
         *.iso, *.raw, *.bin
         *.lha, *.lzh
         *.tar.lz, *.tlz
         *.lz
         *.7z
         *.pdf
         *.rar, *.r[0-9][0-9]
         *.rpm
         *.tar.gz, *.tgz, *.tar.z, *.tar.dz
         *.gz, *.z, *.dz
         *.tar
         *.tar.xz, *.xz
         *.jar, *.war, *.xpi, *.zip
         *.zoo

USER DEFINED FILTERS
       It is possible to extend and overwrite the default lesspipe and lessfile input processor if you have special‐
       ized requirements. Create an executable program with the name .lessfilter and put it into  your  home  direc‐
       tory. This can be a shell script or a binary program.


       It  is  important that this program returns the correct exit code: return 0 if your filter handles the input,
       return 1 if the standard lesspipe/lessfile filter should handle the input.


       Here is an example script:

         #!/bin/sh

         case "$1" in
             *.extension)
                 extension-handler "$1"
                 ;;
             *)
                 # We don't handle this format.
                 exit 1
         esac

         # No further processing by lesspipe necessary
         exit 0


FILES
       ~/.lessfilter
              Executable file that can do user defined processing. See section USER DEFINED FILTERS for more  infor‐
              mation.

BUGS
       When  trying  to  open  compressed 0 byte files, less displays the actual binary file contents. This is not a
       bug.  less is designed to do that (see manual page less(1), section INPUT PREPROCESSOR).  This is the  answer
       of Mark Nudelman <markn@greenwoodsoftware.com>:

              "I recognized when I designed it that a lesspipe filter cannot output an empty file and have less dis‐
              play nothing in that case; it's a side effect of using the "no output" case to mean  "the  filter  has
              nothing to do".  It could have been designed to have some other mechanism to indicate "nothing to do",
              but "no output" seemed the simplest and most intuitive for lesspipe writers."


       Sometimes, less does not display the contents file you want to view but output that is produced by your login
       scripts (~/.bashrc or ~/.bash_profile). This happens because less uses your current shell to run the lesspipe
       filter. Bash first looks for the variable $BASH_ENV in the  environment  expands  its  value  and   uses  the
       expanded  value as the name of a file to read and execute. If this file produces any output less will display
       this. A way to solve this problem is to put the following lines on the top of your login script that produces
       output:

         if [ -z "$PS1" ]; then
             exit
         fi

       This  tests  whether  the  prompt variable $PS1 is set and if it isn't (which is the case for non-interactive
       shells) it will exit the script.
