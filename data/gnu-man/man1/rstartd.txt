NAME
       rstartd - a sample implementation of a Remote Start rsh helper

SYNOPSIS
       rstartd

       rstartd.real [-c configfilename]

DESCRIPTION
       Rstartd  is  an implementation of a Remote Start "helper" as defined in "A Flexible Remote Execution Protocol
       Based on rsh".

       This document describes the peculiarities of rstartd and how it is configured.

OPTIONS
       -c configfilename
               This option specifies the "global" configuration file that rstartd is to read.  Normally, rstartd  is
               a  shell  script  that  invokes  rstartd.real with the -c switch, allowing local configuration of the
               location of the configuration file.  If rstartd.real is started  without  the  -c  option,  it  reads
               /X11/rstart/config.

INSTALLATION
       It  is  critical  to  successful  interoperation  of the Remote Start protocol that rstartd be installed in a
       directory which is in the "default" search path, so that default rsh requests and the ilk  will  be  able  to
       find it.

CONFIGURATION AND OPERATION
       Rstartd  is  by  design  highly  configurable.  One would like things like configuration file locations to be
       fixed, so that users and administrators can find them without searching, but reality is that no  two  vendors
       will  agree  on  where  things  should go, and nobody thinks the original location is "right".  Thus, rstartd
       allows one to relocate all of its files and directories.

       Rstartd has a hierarchy of configuration files which are executed in order when a request is made.  They are:
       global config
       per-user ("local") config
       global per-context config
       per-user ("local") per-context config
       config from request
       As you might guess from the presence of "config from request", all of the config files are in the  format  of
       an  rstart  request.   Rstartd defines a few additional keywords with the INTERNAL- prefix for specifying its
       configuration.

       Rstartd starts by reading and executing the global config file.  This file will normally  specify  the  loca‐
       tions of the other configuration files and any systemwide defaults.

       Rstartd will then read the user's local config file, default name $HOME/.rstart.

       Rstartd will then start interpreting the request.

       Presumably  one  of  the first lines in the request will be a CONTEXT line.  The context name is converted to
       lower case.

       Rstartd will read the global config file for that context, default name  /usr/lib/X11/rstart/contexts/<name>,
       if any.

       It  will  then  read  the user's config file for that context, default name $HOME/.rstart.contexts/<name>, if
       any.

       (If neither of these exists, rstartd aborts with a Failure message.)

       Rstartd will finish interpreting the request, and execute the program specified.

       This allows the system administrator and the user a large degree of control over the  operation  of  rstartd.
       The  administrator  has  final  say, because the global config file doesn't need to specify a per-user config
       file.  If it does, however, the user can override anything from the global  file,  and  can  even  completely
       replace the global context config files.

       The  config  files  have  a somewhat more flexible format than requests do; they are allowed to contain blank
       lines and lines beginning with "#" are comments and ignored.  (#s in the middle of lines are data,  not  com‐
       ment markers.)

       Any  commands  run are provided a few useful pieces of information in environment variables.  The exact names
       are configurable, but the supplied defaults are:


       $RSTART_CONTEXT
       $RSTART_GLOBAL_CONTEXTS   the global contexts directory
       $RSTART_LOCAL_CONTEXTS    the local contexts directory
       $RSTART_GLOBAL_COMMANDS   the global generic commands directory
       $RSTART_LOCAL_COMMANDS    the local generic commands directory

       $RSTART_{GLOBAL,LOCAL}_CONTEXTS should contain one special file, @List, which contains a list of the contexts
       in  that  directory  in the format specified for ListContexts.  The supplied version of ListContexts will cat
       both the global and local copies of @List.

       Generic commands are searched for in several places: (defaults)
       per-user per-context directory ($HOME/.rstart.commands/<context>)
       global per-context directory (/usr/lib/X11/rstart/commands/<context>)
       per-user all-contexts directory ($HOME/.rstart.commands)
       global all-contexts directory (/usr/lib/X11/rstart/commands)
       (Yes, this means you can't have an all-contexts generic command with the same name as a context.   It  didn't
       seem like a big deal.)

       Each  of  these directories should have a file called @List that gives the names and descriptions of the com‐
       mands in that directory in the format specified for ListGenericCommands.

CONFIGURATION KEYWORDS
       There are several "special" rstart keywords defined for rstartd configuration.  Unless  otherwise  specified,
       there are no defaults; related features are disabled in this case.

       INTERNAL-REGISTRIES name ...
               Gives  a  space-separated  list of "MISC" registries that this system understands.  (Registries other
               than this are accepted but generate a Warning.)

       INTERNAL-LOCAL-DEFAULT relative_filename
               Gives the name ($HOME relative) of the per-user config file.

       INTERNAL-GLOBAL-CONTEXTS absolute_directory_name
               Gives the name of the system-wide contexts directory.

       INTERNAL-LOCAL-CONTEXTS relative_directory_name
               Gives the name ($HOME relative) of the per-user contexts directory.

       INTERNAL-GLOBAL-COMMANDS absolute_directory_name
               Gives the name of the system-wide generic commands directory.

       INTERNAL-LOCAL-COMMANDS relative_directory_name
               Gives the name ($HOME relative) of the per-user generic commands directory.

       INTERNAL-VARIABLE-PREFIX prefix
               Gives the prefix for the configuration environment variables rstartd passes to its kids.

       INTERNAL-AUTH-PROGRAM authscheme program argv[0] argv[1] ...
               Specifies the program to run to set up authentication for the specified authentication scheme.  "pro‐
               gram argv[0] ..." gives the program to run and its arguments, in the same form as the EXEC keyword.

       INTERNAL-AUTH-INPUT authscheme
               Specifies  the data to be given to the authorization program as its standard input.  Each argument is
               passed as a single line.  $n, where n is a number, is replaced by the  n'th  argument  to  the  "AUTH
               authscheme arg1 arg2 ..." line.

       INTERNAL-PRINT arbitrary text
               Prints  its  arguments  as a Debug message.  Mostly for rstartd debugging, but could be used to debug
               config files.

NOTES
       When using the C shell, or any other shell which runs a script every time the shell is  started,  the  script
       may get run several times.  In the worst case, the script may get run three times:
       By rsh, to run rstartd
       By rstartd, to run the specified command
       By the command, eg xterm
       rstartd currently limits lines, both from config files and requests, to BUFSIZ bytes.

       DETACH  is  implemented  by redirecting file descriptors 0,1, and 2 to /dev/null and forking before executing
       the program.

       CMD is implemented by invoking $SHELL (default /bin/sh) with "-c" and the specified command as arguments.

       POSIX-UMASK is implemented in the obvious way.

       The authorization programs are run in the same context as the target program -  same  environment  variables,
       path, etc.  Long term this might be a problem.

       In  the  X  context,  GENERIC-CMD Terminal runs xterm.  In the OpenWindows context, GENERIC-CMD Terminal runs
       cmdtool.

       In the X context, GENERIC-CMD LoadMonitor runs xload.  In the OpenWindows  context,  GENERIC-CMD  LoadMonitor
       runs perfmeter.

       GENERIC-CMD  ListContexts  lists the contents of @List in both the system-wide and per-user contexts directo‐
       ries.  It is available in all contexts.

       GENERIC-CMD ListGenericCommands lists the contents of @List in the system-wide and per-user commands directo‐
       ries, including the per-context subdirectories for the current context.  It is available in all contexts.

       CONTEXT None is not implemented.

       CONTEXT Default is really dull.

       For  installation ease, the "contexts" directory in the distribution contains a file "@Aliases" which lists a
       context name and aliases for that context.  This file is used to make symlinks in the contexts  and  commands
       directories.

       All MISC values are passed unmodified as environment variables.

       One  can  mistreat  rstartd  in any number of ways, resulting in anything from stupid behavior to core dumps.
       Other than by explicitly running programs I don't think it can write or delete  any  files,  but  there's  no
       guarantee  of  that.   The important thing is that (a) it probably won't do anything REALLY stupid and (b) it
       runs with the user's permissions, so it can't do anything catastrophic.

       @List files need not be complete; contexts or commands which are dull or which need  not  or  should  not  be
       advertised  need  not be listed.  In particular, per-user @List files should not list things which are in the
       system-wide @List files.  In the future, perhaps ListContexts and ListGenericCommands will automatically sup‐
       press lines from the system-wide files when there are per-user replacements for those lines.

       Error  handling  is  OK  to  weak.   In  particular, no attempt is made to properly report errors on the exec
       itself.  (Perversely, exec errors could be reliably  reported  when  detaching,  but  not  when  passing  the
       stdin/out socket to the app.)

       If  compiled with -DODT1_DISPLAY_HACK, rstartd will work around a bug in SCO ODT version 1.  (1.1?)  (The bug
       is that the X clients are all compiled with a bad library that doesn't know how to look host names  up  using
       DNS.  The fix is to look up a host name in $DISPLAY and substitute an IP address.)  This is a trivial example
       of an incompatibility that rstart can hide.
