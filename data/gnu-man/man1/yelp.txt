YELP(1)                                        General Commands Manual                                       YELP(1)



NAME
       yelp — browse system documentation

USAGE
       yelp [file]

       The  GNOME Help Browser includes detailed documentation for the majority of applications, utilities and other
       components, such as the panel or the Nautilus file manager.


       Yelp can display some HTML and XML files when passed on the command-line,  but  it's  primarily  called  from
       applications.

       You  can  also  start Yelp by choosing Desktop->Help.  This will show the top-level help system page, listing
       all GNOME documents conveniently organized by topic.

OPTIONS
       This program accepts all the standard GNOME and GTK+ options, which follow the usual GNU command line syntax,
       with  long  options  starting  with two dashes (`-'). To get more information about these options launch Yelp
       with the `--help' argument.
