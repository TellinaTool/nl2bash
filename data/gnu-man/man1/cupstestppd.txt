NAME
       cupstestppd - test conformance of ppd files

SYNOPSIS
       cupstestppd  [  -I  category  ]  [ -R rootdir ] [ -W category ] [ -q ] [-r] [ -v[v] ] filename.ppd[.gz] [ ...
       filenameN.ppd[.gz] ]
       cupstestppd [ -R rootdir ] [ -W category ] [ -q ] [-r] [ -v[v] ] -

DESCRIPTION
       cupstestppd tests the conformance of PPD files to the Adobe PostScript Printer Description file format speci‐
       fication  version  4.3.  It can also be used to list the supported options and available fonts in a PPD file.
       The results of testing and any other output are sent to the standard output.

       The first form of cupstestppd tests one or more PPD files on the command-line. The second form tests the  PPD
       file provided on the standard input.

OPTIONS
       cupstestppd supports the following options:

       -I filename
            Ignores all PCFileName warnings.

       -I filters
            Ignores all filter errors.

       -I profiles
            Ignores all profile errors.

       -R rootdir
            Specifies an alternate root directory for the filter, pre-filter, and other support file checks.

       -W constraints
            Report all UIConstraint errors as warnings.

       -W defaults
            Except for size-related options, report all default option errors as warnings.

       -W filters
            Report all filter errors as warnings.

       -W profiles
            Report all profile errors as warnings.

       -W sizes
            Report all media size errors as warnings.

       -W translations
            Report all translation errors as warnings.

       -W all
            Report all of the previous errors as warnings.

       -W none
            Report all of the previous errors as errors.

       -q
            Specifies that no information should be displayed.

       -r
            Relaxes  the  PPD  conformance requirements so that common whitespace, control character, and formatting
            problems are not treated as hard errors.

       -v
            Specifies that detailed conformance  testing  results  should  be  displayed  rather  than  the  concise
            PASS/FAIL/ERROR status.

       -vv
            Specifies  that  all information in the PPD file should be displayed in addition to the detailed confor‐
            mance testing results.

       The -q, -v, and -vv options are mutually exclusive.

EXIT STATUS
       cupstestppd returns zero on success and non-zero on error. The error codes are as follows:

       1
            Bad command-line arguments or missing PPD filename.

       2
            Unable to open or read PPD file.

       3
            The PPD file contains format errors that cannot be skipped.

       4
            The PPD file does not conform to the Adobe PPD specification.

EXAMPLES
       The following command will test all PPD files under the current directory and print the names  of  each  file
       that does not conform:

           find . -name \*.ppd \! -exec cupstestppd -q '{}' \; -print

       The  next  command  tests  all  PPD  files under the current directory and print detailed conformance testing
       results for the files that do not conform:

           find . -name \*.ppd \! -exec cupstestppd -q '{}' \; \
               -exec cupstestppd -v '{}' \;
