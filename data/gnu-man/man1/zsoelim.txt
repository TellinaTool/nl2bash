NAME
       zsoelim - satisfy .so requests in roff input

SYNOPSIS
       zsoelim [-CVh] [file ...]

DESCRIPTION
       zsoelim parses file arguments, or if none are specified, its standard input for lines of the form:

       .so <filename>

       These requests are replaced by the contents of the filename specified.  If the request cannot be met, zsoelim
       looks for filename.ext where .ext can be one of .gz, .Z or  .z.   Other  extension  types  may  be  supported
       depending  upon  compile  time  options.  If the request can be met by a compressed file, this file is decom‐
       pressed using an appropriate decompressor and its output is used to satisfy the request.

       Traditionally, soelim programs were used to allow roff preprocessors to  be  able  to  preprocess  the  files
       referred  to  by the requests.  This particular version was written to circumvent problems created by support
       for compressed manual pages.

OPTIONS
       -C, --compatible
              This flag is available for compatibility with other  soelim  programs.   Its  use  is  to  enable  .so
              requests followed by something other than whitespace.  As this is already the default behaviour, it is
              ignored.

       -h, --help
              Print a help message and exit.

       -V, --version
              Display version information.
