SGMLNORM(1)                                                                                              SGMLNORM(1)



NAME
       sgmlnorm - normalize SGML documents

       An SGML System Conforming to International Standard ISO 8879 -- Standard Generalized Markup Language

SYNOPSIS
       sgmlnorm [ -Cdemnv ]  [ -bbctf ]  [ -ccatalog ]  [ -Ddir ]  [ -iname ]  [ -wwarning ]  sysid...

DESCRIPTION
       sgmlnorm  prints on the standard output a normalized document instance for the SGML document contained in the
       concatenation of the entities with system identifiers sysid...

       When the normalized instance is prefixed with the original SGML declaration and prolog, it will have the same
       ESIS as the original SGML document, with the following exceptions:

       · The  output  of  sgmlnorm  does  not  protect against the recognition of short reference delimiters, so any
         USEMAP declarations must be removed from the DTD.

       · The normalized instance will use the reference delimiters, even if the original instance did not.

       · If marked sections are included in the output using the -m option, the reference  reserved  names  will  be
         used for the status keywords even if the original instance did not.

       · Any ESIS information relating to the SGML LINK feature will be lost.

       The normalized instance will not use any markup minimization features except that:

       · Any  attributes  that  were  not  specified in the original instance will not be included in the normalized
         instance.  (Current attributes will be included.)

       · If the declared value of an attribute was a name token group, and a value was specified that was  the  same
         as  the  name  of the attribute, then the attribute name and value indicator will be omitted.  For example,
         with HTML sgmlnorm would output <DL COMPACT> rather than <DL COMPACT="COMPACT">.

OPTIONS
       -bbctf Use the BCTF name bctf for output.  See nsgmls(1) for more information about this option.

       -cfile Use the catalog entry file file.

       -C     The filename... arguments specify catalog files rather than the document entity. The  document  entity
              is specified by the first DOCUMENT entry in the catalog files.

       -d     Output  a  document type declaration with the same external identifier as the input document, and with
              no internal declaration subset.  No check is performed  that  the  document  instance  is  valid  with
              respect to this DTD.

       -Ddirectory
              Search  directory  for  files  specified  in  system identifiers. Multiple -D options are allowed. See
              nsgmls(1) for more information about this option.

       -e     Describe open entities in error messages.

       -iname Pretend that <!ENTITY % name "INCLUDE"> occurs at the start of the document type declaration subset in
              the  SGML  document  entity. Since repeated definitions of an entity are ignored, this definition will
              take precedence over any other definitions of this entity in the document type  declaration.  Multiple
              -i  options  are  allowed.  If  the  SGML  declaration replaces the reserved name INCLUDE then the new
              reserved name will be the replacement text of the entity. Typically the document type declaration will
              contain  <!ENTITY % name "IGNORE"> and will use %name; in the status keyword specification of a marked
              section declaration. In this case the effect of the option will be to cause the marked section not  to
              be ignored.

       -m     Output any marked sections that were in the input document instance.

       -n     Output any comments that were in the input document instance.

       -r     Raw  output.   Don't perform any conversion on RSs and REs when printing the entity.  The entity would
              typically have the storage manager attribute records=asis.

       -v     Print the version number.

       -wtype Control warnings and errors according to type.  See nsgmls(1) for the allowed values of type.
