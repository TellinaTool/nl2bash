NAME
       add-apt-repository  -  Adds a repository into the /etc/apt/sources.list or /etc/apt/sources.list.d or removes
       an existing one

SYNOPSIS
       add-apt-repository [OPTIONS] REPOSITORY

DESCRIPTION
       add-apt-repository is a script which adds an external APT repository to  either  /etc/apt/sources.list  or  a
       file in /etc/apt/sources.list.d/ or removes an already existing repository.

       The options supported by add-apt-repository are:

       -h, --help Show help message and exit

       -m, --massive-debug Print a lot of debug information to the command line

       -r, --remove Remove the specified repository

       -y, --yes Assume yes to all queries

       -k, --keyserver Use a custom keyserver URL instead of the default

       -s, --enable-source Allow downloading of the source packages from the repository



REPOSITORY STRING
       REPOSITORY  can  be either a line that can be added directly to sources.list(5), in the form ppa:<user>/<ppa-
       name> for adding Personal Package Archives, or a distribution component to enable.

       In the first form, REPOSITORY will just be appended to /etc/apt/sources.list.

       In the second form, ppa:<user>/<ppa-name> will be expanded to the full deb line of the PPA and added  into  a
       new  file  in the /etc/apt/sources.list.d/ directory.  The GPG public key of the newly added PPA will also be
       downloaded and added to apt's keyring.

       In the third form, the given distribution component will be enabled for all sources.
