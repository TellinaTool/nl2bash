NAME
       wish - Simple windowing shell

SYNOPSIS
       wish ?-encoding name? ?fileName arg arg ...?

OPTIONS
       -encoding name      Specifies  the  encoding  of the text stored in fileName.  This option is only recognized
                           prior to the fileName argument.

       -colormap new       Specifies that the window should have a new private colormap instead of using the default
                           colormap for the screen.

       -display display    Display (and screen) on which to display window.

       -geometry geometry  Initial  geometry to use for window.  If this option is specified, its value is stored in
                           the geometry global variable of the application's Tcl interpreter.

       -name name          Use name as the title to be displayed in the window, and as the name of  the  interpreter
                           for send commands.

       -sync               Execute  all  X  server  commands synchronously, so that errors are reported immediately.
                           This will result in much slower execution, but it is useful for debugging.

       -use id             Specifies that the main window for the application is to be embedded in the window  whose
                           identifier is id, instead of being created as an independent toplevel window.  Id must be
                           specified in the same way as the value for the -use option for toplevel widgets (i.e.  it
                           has a form like that returned by the winfo id command).
                           Note  that  on some platforms this will only work correctly if id refers to a Tk frame or
                           toplevel that has its -container option enabled.

       -visual visual      Specifies the visual to use for the window.  Visual may have any of the  forms  supported
                           by the Tk_GetVisual procedure.

       --                  Pass  all  remaining arguments through to the script's argv variable without interpreting
                           them.  This provides a mechanism for passing arguments such as -name to a script  instead
                           of having wish interpret them.

DESCRIPTION
       Wish  is  a  simple  program  consisting of the Tcl command language, the Tk toolkit, and a main program that
       reads commands from standard input or from a file.  It creates a main window and then processes Tcl commands.
       If  wish  is  invoked  with arguments, then the first few arguments, ?-encoding name? ?fileName?, specify the
       name of a script file, and, optionally, the encoding of the text data stored in that script  file.   A  value
       for fileName is recognized if the appropriate argument does not start with “-”.

       If  there are no arguments, or the arguments do not specify a fileName, then wish reads Tcl commands interac‐
       tively from standard input.  It will continue processing commands until all  windows  have  been  deleted  or
       until  end-of-file  is  reached on standard input.  If there exists a file “.wishrc” in the home directory of
       the user, wish evaluates the file as a Tcl script just before reading the first command from standard input.

       If arguments to wish do specify a fileName, then fileName is treated as the name of a script file.  Wish will
       evaluate  the  script in fileName (which presumably creates a user interface), then it will respond to events
       until all windows have been deleted.  Commands will not be read from standard input.  There is  no  automatic
       evaluation  of “.wishrc” when the name of a script file is presented on the wish command line, but the script
       file can always source it if desired.

       Note that on Windows, the wishversion.exe program varies from the tclshversion.exe program in  an  additional
       important  way:  it does not connect to a standard Windows console and is instead a windowed program. Because
       of this, it additionally provides access to its own console command.

OPTION PROCESSING
       Wish automatically processes all of the command-line options described in the  OPTIONS  summary  above.   Any
       other  command-line  arguments  besides  these  are passed through to the application using the argc and argv
       variables described later.

APPLICATION NAME AND CLASS
       The name of the application, which is used for purposes such as  send  commands,  is  taken  from  the  -name
       option,  if  it  is  specified;  otherwise it is taken from fileName, if it is specified, or from the command
       name by which wish was invoked.  In the last two cases, if the name contains a “/” character, then  only  the
       characters after the last slash are used as the application name.

       The  class  of the application, which is used for purposes such as specifying options with a RESOURCE_MANAGER
       property or .Xdefaults file, is the same as its name except that the first letter is capitalized.

VARIABLES
       Wish sets the following Tcl variables:

       argc           Contains a count of the number of arg  arguments  (0  if  none),  not  including  the  options
                      described above.

       argv           Contains  a  Tcl  list  whose elements are the arg arguments that follow a -- option or do not
                      match any of the options described in OPTIONS above, in order, or an empty string if there are
                      no such arguments.

       argv0          Contains  fileName  if  it  was  specified.   Otherwise,  contains  the name by which wish was
                      invoked.

       geometry       If the -geometry option is specified, wish copies its value into this variable.  If the  vari‐
                      able  still exists after fileName has been evaluated, wish uses the value of the variable in a
                      wm geometry command to set the main window's geometry.

       tcl_interactive
                      Contains 1 if wish is reading commands interactively (fileName was not specified and  standard
                      input is a terminal-like device), 0 otherwise.

SCRIPT FILES
       If you create a Tcl script in a file whose first line is
              #!/usr/local/bin/wish
       then you can invoke the script file directly from your shell if you mark it as executable.  This assumes that
       wish has been installed in the default location in /usr/local/bin;  if it is installed  somewhere  else  then
       you  will have to modify the above line to match.  Many UNIX systems do not allow the #! line to exceed about
       30 characters in length, so be sure that the wish executable can be accessed with a short file name.

       An even better approach is to start your script files with the following three lines:
              #!/bin/sh
              # the next line restarts using wish \
              exec wish "$0" ${1+"$@"}
       This approach has three advantages over the approach in the previous paragraph.  First, the location  of  the
       wish  binary  does  not have to be hard-wired into the script:  it can be anywhere in your shell search path.
       Second, it gets around the 30-character file name limit in the previous approach.  Third, this approach  will
       work  even  if wish is itself a shell script (this is done on some systems in order to handle multiple archi‐
       tectures or operating systems:  the wish script selects one of several binaries to  run).   The  three  lines
       cause  both  sh and wish to process the script, but the exec is only executed by sh.  sh processes the script
       first;  it treats the second line as a comment and executes the third line.  The  exec  statement  cause  the
       shell  to  stop processing and instead to start up wish to reprocess the entire script.  When wish starts up,
       it treats all three lines as comments, since the backslash at the end of the second  line  causes  the  third
       line to be treated as part of the comment on the second line.

       The  end of a script file may be marked either by the physical end of the medium, or by the character, “\032”
       (“\u001a”, control-Z).  If this character is present in the file, the wish application will read text  up  to
       but  not  including  the character.  An application that requires this character in the file may encode it as
       “\032”, “\x1a”, or “\u001a”; or may generate it by use of commands such as format or binary.

PROMPTS
       When wish is invoked interactively it normally prompts for each command with “% ”.  You can change the prompt
       by setting the variables tcl_prompt1 and tcl_prompt2.  If variable tcl_prompt1 exists then it must consist of
       a Tcl script to output a  prompt;   instead  of  outputting  a  prompt  wish  will  evaluate  the  script  in
       tcl_prompt1.   The variable tcl_prompt2 is used in a similar way when a newline is typed but the current com‐
       mand is not yet complete; if tcl_prompt2 is not set then no prompt is output for incomplete commands.
