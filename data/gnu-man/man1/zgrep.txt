ZGREP(1)                                       General Commands Manual                                      ZGREP(1)



NAME
       zgrep - search possibly compressed files for a regular expression

SYNOPSIS
       zgrep [ grep_options ] [ -e ] pattern filename...

DESCRIPTION
       Zgrep  invokes grep on compressed or gzipped files.  These grep options will cause zgrep to terminate with an
       error code: (-[drRzZ]|--di*|--exc*|--inc*|--rec*|--nu*).  All other options specified are passed directly  to
       grep.  If no file is specified, then the standard input is decompressed if necessary and fed to grep.  Other‐
       wise the given files are uncompressed if necessary and fed to grep.

       If the GREP environment variable is set, zgrep uses it as the grep program to be invoked.

EXIT CODE
       2 - An option that is not supported was specified.
