WORD-LIST-COMPRESS(1)                     Aspell Abbreviated User's Manual                     WORD-LIST-COMPRESS(1)



NAME
       word-list-compress - word list compressor/decompressor for GNU Aspell

SYNOPSIS
       word-list-compress c[ompress] | d[ecompress]

DESCRIPTION
       word-list-compress compresses or decompresses sorted word lists for use with the GNU Aspell spell checker.

COMMANDS
       -c, c, compress
              compress the plain text word list read from standard input.

       -d, d, decompress
              decompress the compressed word list read from standard input.

EXAMPLES
       Here are a few examples of how you can use word-list-compress

       word-list-compress d <wordlist.cwl >wordlist.txt
              Decompress file wordlist.cwl to text file wordlist.txt

       word-list-compress c <wordlist.wl >wordlist.cwl 2>errors.txt
              Compress wordlist.wl to wordlist.cwl and send any error messages to a text file named errors.txt

       LC_COLLATE=C sort -u <wordlist.txt | word-list-compress c >wordlist.cwl
              Sort a word list, then pipe it to word-list-compress to create a compressed binary wordlist.cwl file.

       word-list-compress d <words.cwl | aspell create master ./words.rws
              Decompress  a  wordlist,  then  pipe  it  to  aspell(1)  to  create a spelling list.  Please check the
              aspell(1) info manual for proper usage and options.

TIPS
       Word-list-compress is best used with sorted word list type files.  It is not a  general  purpose  compression
       program since the resulting files may actually increase in size.

       Word-list-compress  accepts  up  to  255  text  characters  in  the range of {0x21...0xFF}. If your word list
       requires a larger character set for certain languages or longer length for multi-word,  scientific,  medical,
       technical or other use, then it is recommended that you compress your word list using prezip-bin(1)

DIAGNOSTICS
       Word-list-compress  normally  exits  with a return code of 0. If it encounters an error, a message is sent to
       standard error output (stderr), and word-list-compress exits with a non-zero return  value.   Error  messages
       are listed below:

       (display help/usage message)
              Unknown  command  given on the command line so word-list-compress displays a usage message to standard
              error output.

       Corrupt Input
              This is only for the decompression command d.  The input file is of an unknown  format  or  the  input
              file/stream  is  corrupted.  You may have some valid output, but word-list-compress could not complete
              the process.  If the input file is a compressed wordlist but you have no output file, then it may be a
              newer  prezip-bin(1)  version of compressed file, if so, try decompressing the file with prezip-bin(1)
              instead.

       Output Data Error
              The output is full, write protected, or has an error and can no longer be written to.
