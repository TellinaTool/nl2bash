sgitopnm(1)                                    General Commands Manual                                   sgitopnm(1)



NAME
       sgitopnm - convert a SGI image file to a portable anymap

SYNOPSIS
       sgitopnm [-verbose] [-channel c] [SGIfile]

DESCRIPTION
       Reads an SGI image file as input.  Produces a PGM image for a 2-dimensional (1 channel) input file, and a PPM
       image for a 3-dimensional (3 or more channels) input file.

       Alternatively, produces a PGM image of any one of the channels in the input file.


OPTIONS
       -verbose
              Give some information about the SGI image file.

       -channel c
              Extract channel c of the image as a PGM image.  Without this option, sgitopnm  extracts  the  first  3
              channels  as a PPM image or, if the input has only 1 channel, extracts that as a PGM image, and if the
              input has 2 channels, fails.
