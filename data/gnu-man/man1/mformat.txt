Description
       The mformat command is used to add an MS-DOS file system to a low-level formatted diskette. Its syntax is:

       mformat [-t cylinders|-T tot_sectors] [-h heads] [-s sectors]
         [-f size] [-1] [-4] [-8]
         [-v volume_label]
         [-F] [-S sizecode]
         [-M software_sector_size]
         [-N serial_number] [-a]
         [-C] [-H hidden_sectors] [-I fsVersion]
         [-r root_sectors] [-L fat_len]
         [-B boot_sector] [-k]
         [-m media_descriptor]
         [-K backup_boot]
         [-c clusters_per_sector]
         [-d fat_copies]
         [-X] [-2 sectors_on_track_0] [-3]
         [-0 rate_on_track_0] [-A rate_on_other_tracks]
         drive:


       Mformat adds a minimal MS-DOS file system (boot sector, FAT, and root  directory)  to  a  diskette  that  has
       already been formatted by a Unix low-level format.

       The following options are supported: (The S, 2, 1 and M options may not exist if this copy of mtools has been
       compiled without the USE_2M option)

       The following options are the same as for MS-DOS's format command:

Options
       v      Specifies the volume label. A volume label identifies the disk and can be a maximum of 11  characters.
              If you omit the -v switch, mformat will assign no label to the disk.

       f      Specifies  the  size  of  the DOS file system to format. Only a certain number of predefined sizes are
              supported by this flag; for others use the -h/-t/-s flags. The following sizes are supported:

              160    160K, single-sided, 8 sectors per track, 40 cylinders (for 5 1/4 DD)

              180    160K, single-sided, 9 sectors per track, 40 cylinders (for 5 1/4 DD)

              320    320K, double-sided, 8 sectors per track, 40 cylinders (for 5 1/4 DD)

              360    360K, double-sided, 9 sectors per track, 40 cylinders (for 5 1/4 DD)

              720    720K, double-sided, 9 sectors per track, 80 cylinders (for 3 1/2 DD)

              1200   1200K, double-sided, 15 sectors per track, 80 cylinders (for 5 1/4 HD)

              1440   1440K, double-sided, 18 sectors per track, 80 cylinders (for 3 1/2 HD)

              2880   2880K, double-sided, 36 sectors per track, 80 cylinders (for 3 1/2 ED)

       t      Specifies the number of tracks on the disk.

       T      Specifies the number of total sectors on the disk. Only one  of  these  2  options  may  be  specified
              (tracks or total sectors)

       h      The number of heads (sides).

       s      Specifies the number of sectors per track. If the 2m option is given, number of 512-byte sector equiv‐
              alents on generic tracks (i.e. not head 0 track 0).  If the 2m option is not given, number of physical
              sectors per track (which may be bigger than 512 bytes).

       1      Formats a single side (equivalent to -h 1)

       4      Formats  a  360K double-sided disk (equivalent to -f 360). When used together with -the 1 switch, this
              switch formats a 180K disk

       8      Formats a disk with 8 sectors per track.

       MS-DOS format's q, u and b options are not supported, and s has a different meaning.

       The following options are specific to mtools:

       F      Format the partition as FAT32.

       S      The size code. The size of the sector is 2 ^ (sizecode + 7).

       X      formats the disk as an XDF disk. See section XDF, for more details. The disk has first to be low-level
              formatted  using  the xdfcopy utility included in the fdutils package. XDF disks are used for instance
              for OS/2 install disks.

       2      2m format. The parameter to this option describes the number of sectors  on  track  0,  head  0.  This
              option is recommended for sectors bigger than normal.

       3      don't use a 2m format, even if the current geometry of the disk is a 2m geometry.

       0      Data transfer rate on track 0

       A      Data transfer rate on tracks other than 0

       M      software  sector  size. This parameter describes the sector size in bytes used by the MS-DOS file sys‐
              tem. By default it is the physical sector size.

       N      Uses the requested serial number, instead of generating one automatically

       a      If this option is given, an Atari style serial number is generated.  Ataris store their serial  number
              in the OEM label.

       C      creates  the  disk  image  file to install the MS-DOS file system on it. Obviously, this is useless on
              physical devices such as floppies and hard disk partitions, but is interesting for image files.

       H      number of hidden sectors. This parameter is useful for formatting hard disk partition, which  are  not
              aligned  on track boundaries (i.e. first head of first track doesn't belong to the partition, but con‐
              tains a partition table). In that case the number of hidden sectors is in general the number  of  sec‐
              tors per cylinder. This is untested.

       I      Sets  the  fsVersion  id  when  formatting  a FAT32 drive.  In order to find this out, run minfo on an
              existing FAT32 drive, and mail me about it, so I can include the correct value in future  versions  of
              mtools.

       c      Sets  the  size of a cluster (in sectors).  If this cluster size would generate a FAT that too big for
              its number of bits, mtools automatically increases the cluster size, until the FAT is small enough.

       d      Sets the number of FAT copies. Default is 2. This setting can also be specified using the MTOOLS_NFATS
              environment variable.

       r      Sets the size of the root directory (in sectors).  Only applicable to 12 and 16 bit FATs. This setting
              can also be specified using the MTOOLS_DIR_LEN environment variable.

       L      Sets the length of the FAT.

       B      Use the boot sector stored in the given file or device, instead of using its own.  Only  the  geometry
              fields are updated to match the target disks parameters.

       k      Keep  the  existing  boot sector as much as possible.  Only the geometry fields and other similar file
              system data are updated to match the target disks parameters.

       K      Sets the sector number where the backup of the boot sector should be stored (only relevant on FAT32).

       m      Use a non-standard media descriptor byte for this disk. The media descriptor is stored at position  21
              of  the  boot  sector,  and as first byte in each FAT copy. Using this option may confuse DOS or older
              mtools version, and may make the disk unreadable. Only use if you know what you are doing.

       To format a diskette at a density other than the default, you must  supply  (at  least)  those  command  line
       parameters that are different from the default.

       Mformat returns 0 on success or 1 on failure.

       It doesn't record bad block information to the Fat, use mbadblocks for that.

Viewing the texi doc
       This  manpage  has been automatically generated from mtools's texinfo documentation. However, this process is
       only approximative, and some items, such as crossreferences, footnotes and indices are lost in this  transla‐
       tion  process.   Indeed, these items have no appropriate representation in the manpage format.  Moreover, not
       all information has been translated into the manpage version.  Thus I strongly advise you to use the original
       texinfo doc.  See the end of this manpage for instructions how to view the texinfo doc.

       *      To generate a printable copy from the texinfo doc, run the following commands:

                     ./configure; make dvi; dvips mtools.dvi



       *      To generate a html copy,  run:

                     ./configure; make html

       The  texinfo doc looks most pretty when printed or as html.  Indeed, in the info version certain examples are
       difficult to read due to the quoting conventions used in info.
