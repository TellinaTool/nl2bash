NAME
       pbmtoascii - convert a portable bitmap into ASCII graphics

SYNOPSIS
       pbmtoascii [-1x2|-2x4] [pbmfile]

DESCRIPTION
       Reads a portable bitmap as input.  Produces a somewhat crude ASCII graphic as output.

       Note that there is no asciitopbm tool - this transformation is one-way.

OPTIONS
       The  -1x2 and -2x4 flags give you two alternate ways for the bits to get mapped to characters.  With 1x2, the
       default, each character represents a group of 1 bit across by 2 bits down.  With -2x4, each character  repre‐
       sents  2  bits  across by 4 bits down.  With the 1x2 mode you can see the individual bits, so it's useful for
       previewing small bitmaps on a non-graphics terminal.  The 2x4 mode lets you display larger bitmaps on a stan‐
       dard  80-column  display, but it obscures bit-level details.  2x4 mode is also good for displaying graymaps -
       "pnmscale -width 158 | pgmnorm | pgmtopbm -thresh" should give good results.
