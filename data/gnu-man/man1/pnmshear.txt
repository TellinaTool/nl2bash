NAME
       pnmshear - shear a portable anymap by some angle

SYNOPSIS
       pnmshear [-noantialias] angle [pnmfile]

DESCRIPTION
       Reads a portable anymap as input.  Shears it by the specified angle and produces a portable anymap as output.
       If the input file is in color, the output will be too, otherwise it will  be  grayscale.   The  angle  is  in
       degrees (floating point), and measures this:
           +-------+  +-------+
           |       |  |\       \
           |  OLD  |  | \  NEW  \
           |       |  |an\       \
           +-------+  |gle+-------+
       If the angle is negative, it shears the other way:
           +-------+  |-an+-------+
           |       |  |gl/       /
           |  OLD  |  |e/  NEW  /
           |       |  |/       /
           +-------+  +-------+
       The angle should not get too close to 90 or -90, or the resulting anymap will be unreasonably wide.

       The  shearing is implemented by looping over the source pixels and distributing fractions to each of the des‐
       tination pixels.  This has an "anti-aliasing" effect - it avoids jagged edges and  similar  artifacts.   How‐
       ever,  it  also means that the original colors or gray levels in the image are modified.  If you need to keep
       precisely the same set of colors, you can use the -noantialias flag.  This does the shearing by moving pixels
       without  changing their values.  If you want anti-aliasing and don't care about the precise colors, but still
       need a limited *number* of colors, you can run the result through ppmquant.

       All flags can be abbreviated to their shortest unique prefix.
