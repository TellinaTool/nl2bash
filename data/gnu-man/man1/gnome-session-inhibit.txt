GNOME-SESSION-INHI(1)                               User Commands                              GNOME-SESSION-INHI(1)



NAME
       gnome-session-inhibit - inhibit gnome-session functionality

SYNOPSIS
       gnome-session-inhibit [OPTION...] [COMMAND]

DESCRIPTION
       gnome-session-inhibit can inhibit certain gnome-session functionality while executing the given COMMAND. To
       achieve this, it calls the Inhibit() method of the gnome-session D-Bus API and creates an inhibitor. The
       inhibitor is automatically removed when gnome-session-inhibit exits.

       A typical use case is to prevent the session from going idle (and thus locking the screen) while a movie
       player is running.

OPTIONS
       -h, --help
           print help and exit

       --version
           print version information and exit

       --app-id ID
           The application id to use when calling the gnome-session Inhibit() method. If this option is not
           specified, "unknown" is used.

       --reason REASON
           A human-readable reason to pass along when calling the gnome-session Inhibit() method. If this option is
           not specified, "not specified" is used.

       --inhibit ARG
           ARG specifies the things to inhibit, as a colon-separated list. The possible values are logout,
           switch-user, suspend, idle, automount. If this option is used more than once, the values are combined. If
           this option is not specified, "idle" is assumed.

       --inhibit-only
           Do not launch COMMAND and wait forever instead
