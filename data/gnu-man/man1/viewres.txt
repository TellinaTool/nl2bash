NAME
       viewres - graphical class browser for Xt

SYNOPSIS
       viewres [-option ...]

DESCRIPTION
       The  viewres  program displays a tree showing the widget class hierarchy of the Athena Widget Set.  Each node
       in the tree can be expanded to show the resources that the corresponding class adds (i.e.  does  not  inherit
       from  its  parent) when a widget is created.  This application allows the user to visually examine the struc‐
       ture and inherited resources for the Athena Widget Set.

OPTIONS
       Viewres accepts all of the standard toolkit command line options as well as the following:

       -top name
               This option specifies the name of the highest widget in the hierarchy to display.  This is  typically
               used to limit the display to a subset of the tree.  The default is Object.

       -variable
               This  option  indicates  that  the widget variable names (as declared in header files) should be dis‐
               played in the nodes rather than the widget class name.  This is sometimes useful to distinguish  wid‐
               get classes that share the same name (such as Text).

       -vertical
               This option indicates that the tree should be displayed top to bottom rather left to right.

VIEW MENU
       The way in which the tree is displayed may be changed through the entries in the View menu:

       Show Variable Names
               This  entry  causes the node labels to be set to the variable names used to declare the corresponding
               widget class.  This operation may also be performed with the SetLabelType(variable) translation.

       Show Class Names
               This entry causes the node labels to be set to the class names used when specifying resources.   This
               operation may also be performed with the SetLabelType(class) translation.

       Layout Horizontal
               This  entry  causes the tree to be laid out from left to right.  This operation may also be performed
               with the SetOrientation(West) translation.

       Layout Vertical
               This entry causes the tree to be laid out from top to bottom.  This operation may also  be  performed
               with the SetOrientation(North) translation.

       Show Resource Boxes
               This  entry  expands  the  selected  nodes  (see  next section) to show the new widget and constraint
               resources.  This operation may also be performed with the Resources(on) translation.

       Hide Resource Boxes
               This entry removes the resource displays from the selected nodes (usually to conserve  space).   This
               operation may also be performed with the Resources(off) translation.

SELECT MENU
       Resources  for  a  single  widget class can be displayed by clicking Button2 on the corresponding node, or by
       adding the node to the selection list with Button1 and using the Show Resource Boxes entry in the View  menu.
       Since Button1 actually toggles the selection state of a node, clicking on a selected node will cause it to be
       removed from the selected list.

       Collections of nodes may also be selected through the various entries in the Select menu:

       Unselect All
               This entry removes all nodes from the selection list.  This operation may also be performed with  the
               Select(nothing) translation.

       Select All
               This  entry  adds  all  nodes  to  the selection list.  This operation may also be performed with the
               Select(all) translation.

       Invert All
               This entry adds unselected nodes to, and removes selected nodes from, the selection list.  This oper‐
               ation may also be performed with the Select(invert) translation.

       Select Parent
               This entry selects the immediate parents of all selected nodes.  This operation may also be performed
               with the Select(parent) translation.

       Select Ancestors
               This entry recursively selects all parents of all selected nodes.  This operation may  also  be  per‐
               formed with the Select(ancestors) translation.

       Select Children
               This  entry  selects  the  immediate children of all selected nodes.  This operation may also be per‐
               formed with the Select(children) translation.

       Select Descendants
               This entry recursively selects all children of all selected nodes.  This operation may also  be  per‐
               formed with the Select(descendants) translation.

       Select Has Resources
               This  entry  selects  all nodes that add new resources (regular or constraint) to their corresponding
               widget classes.  This operation may also be performed with the Select(resources) translation.

       Select Shown Resource Boxes
               This entry selects all nodes whose resource boxes are currently expanded (usually so that they can be
               closed with Hide Resource Boxes).  This operation may also be performed with the Select(shown) trans‐
               lation.

ACTIONS
       The following application actions are provided:

       Quit()
               This action causes viewres to exit.

       SetLabelType(type)
               This action sets the node labels to display the widget variable or  class  names,  according  to  the
               argument type.

       SetOrientation(direction)
               This  action  sets the root of the tree to be one of the following areas of the window:  West, North,
               East, or South.

       Select(what)
               This action selects the indicated nodes, as described in the VIEW MENU  section:  nothing  (unselects
               all nodes), invert, parent, ancestors, children, descendants, resources, shown.

       Resources(op)
               This  action  turns  on,  off, or toggles the resource boxes for the selected nodes.  If invoked from
               within one of the nodes (through the keyboard or pointer), only that node is used.
