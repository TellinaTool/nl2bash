NAME
       dh_makeshlibs - automatically create shlibs file and call dpkg-gensymbols

SYNOPSIS
       dh_makeshlibs [debhelper options] [-mmajor] [-V[dependencies]] [-n] [-Xitem] [-- params]

DESCRIPTION
       dh_makeshlibs is a debhelper program that automatically scans for shared libraries, and generates a shlibs
       file for the libraries it finds.

       It also adds a call to ldconfig in the postinst and postrm scripts (in v3 mode and above only) to any
       packages in which it finds shared libraries.

       Packages that support multiarch are detected, and a Pre-Dependency on multiarch-support is set in
       ${misc:Pre-Depends} ; you should make sure to put that token into an appropriate place in your debian/control
       file for packages supporting multiarch.

FILES
       debian/package.symbols
       debian/package.symbols.arch
           These symbols files, if present, are passed to dpkg-gensymbols(1) to be processed and installed. Use the
           arch specific names if you need to provide different symbols files for different architectures.

OPTIONS
       -mmajor, --major=major
           Instead of trying to guess the major number of the library with objdump, use the major number specified
           after the -m parameter. This is much less useful than it used to be, back in the bad old days when this
           program looked at library filenames rather than using objdump.

       -V, -Vdependencies
       --version-info, --version-info=dependencies
           By default, the shlibs file generated by this program does not make packages depend on any particular
           version of the package containing the shared library. It may be necessary for you to add some version
           dependency information to the shlibs file. If -V is specified with no dependency information, the current
           upstream version of the package is plugged into a dependency that looks like "packagename (>=
           packageversion)". Note that in debhelper compatibility levels before v4, the Debian part of the package
           version number is also included. If -V is specified with parameters, the parameters can be used to
           specify the exact dependency information needed (be sure to include the package name).

           Beware of using -V without any parameters; this is a conservative setting that always ensures that other
           packages' shared library dependencies are at least as tight as they need to be (unless your library is
           prone to changing ABI without updating the upstream version number), so that if the maintainer screws up
           then they won't break. The flip side is that packages might end up with dependencies that are too tight
           and so find it harder to be upgraded.

       -n, --noscripts
           Do not modify postinst/postrm scripts.

       -Xitem, --exclude=item
           Exclude files that contain item anywhere in their filename or directory from being treated as shared
           libraries.

       --add-udeb=udeb
           Create an additional line for udebs in the shlibs file and use udeb as the package name for udebs to
           depend on instead of the regular library package.

       -- params
           Pass params to dpkg-gensymbols(1).

EXAMPLES
       dh_makeshlibs
           Assuming this is a package named libfoobar1, generates a shlibs file that looks something like:
            libfoobar 1 libfoobar1

       dh_makeshlibs -V
           Assuming the current version of the package is 1.1-3, generates a shlibs file that looks something like:
            libfoobar 1 libfoobar1 (>= 1.1)

       dh_makeshlibs -V 'libfoobar1 (>= 1.0)'
           Generates a shlibs file that looks something like:
             libfoobar 1 libfoobar1 (>= 1.0)
