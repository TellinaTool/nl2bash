NAME
       opl2ofm - convert Omega and TeX property-list files to font-metric files

SYNOPSIS
       opl2ofm [OPTIONS] OPLFILE[.opl] [OFMFILE[.ofm]]

DESCRIPTION
       opl2ofm  translates a property-list format file, OPLFILE, into the binary Omega Font Metric format.  The pro‐
       gram writes to standard output (by default) or to a file specified as OFMFILE.

       The program also works with TeX PL files, producing TeX TFM files.  (opl2ofm is based on the WEB source  code
       for pltotf(1).)

AUTHOR
       According to the WEB documentation:

              The first PLtoTF program was designed by Leo Guibas in the summer of  1978.   Contributions  by  Frank
              Liang,  Doug  Wyatt,  and  Lyle  Ramshaw also had a significant effect on the evolution of the present
              code.

              Extensions for an enhanced ligature mechanism were added by D.E. Knuth in 1989.

              Extensions to handle extended font metric files (``OFM'') were added by John Plaice in  December  1995
              and January 1996, resulting in the new program OPL2OFM.
