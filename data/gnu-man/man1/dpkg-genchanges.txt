NAME
       dpkg-genchanges - generate Debian .changes files

SYNOPSIS
       dpkg-genchanges [option...]

DESCRIPTION
       dpkg-genchanges  reads  information  from  an unpacked and built Debian source tree and from the files it has
       generated and generates a Debian upload control file (.changes file).

OPTIONS
       -b, -B, -A
              Specifies that a binary-only build is taking place (no source files are to be  included).  There's  no
              distinction between -b, -B and -A, the produced .changes file will include whatever files were created
              by the binary-* target(s) of the package being built.

       -S     Specifies that only the source should be uploaded (no binary packages will be included).

       The -sx options control whether the original source archive is included in the upload if any source is  being
       generated (i.e.  -b or -B haven't been used).

       -si    By  default, or if specified, the original source will be included only if the upstream version number
              (the version without epoch and without Debian revision) differs from the upstream  version  number  of
              the previous changelog entry.

       -sa    Forces the inclusion of the original source.

       -sd    Forces the exclusion of the original source and includes only the diff.

       -vversion
              Causes changelog information from all versions strictly later than version to be used.

       -Cchanges-description
              Read  the  description of the changes from the file changes-description rather than using the informa‐
              tion from the source tree's changelog file.

       -mmaintainer-address
              Use maintainer-address as the name and email address of the maintainer for this package,  rather  than
              using the information from the source tree's control file.

       -emaintainer-address
              Use  maintainer-address  as  the name and email address of the maintainer for this upload, rather than
              using the information from the source tree's changelog.

       -Vname=value
              Set an output substitution variable.  See deb-substvars(5) for a discussion of output substitution.

       -Tsubstvars-file
              Read substitution variables in substvars-file; the default is debian/substvars.  No variable substitu‐
              tion  is  done on any of the fields that are output, however the special variable Format will override
              the field of the same name. This option can be used multiple times to read substitution variables from
              multiple files.


       -Dfield=value
              Override or add an output control file field.

       -Ufield
              Remove an output control file field.

       -ccontrolfile
              Specifies the main source control file to read information from. The default is debian/control.

       -lchangelog-file
              Specifies the changelog file to read information from. The default is debian/changelog.

       -ffiles-list-file
              Read the list of files to be uploaded here, rather than using debian/files.

       -Fchangelog-format
              Specifies  the  format  of the changelog. See dpkg-parsechangelog(1) for information about alternative
              formats.

       -uupload-files-dir
              Look for the files to be uploaded in upload-files-dir rather than ..  (dpkg-genchanges needs  to  find
              these files so that it can include their sizes and checksums in the .changes file).

       -q     Usually  dpkg-genchanges  will  produce  informative messages on standard error, for example about how
              many of the package's source files are being uploaded.  -q suppresses these messages.

       -?, --help
              Show the usage message and exit.

       --version
              Show the version and exit.

FILES
       debian/files
              The list of generated files which are part of the upload being prepared.   dpkg-genchanges  reads  the
              data here when producing a .changes file.
