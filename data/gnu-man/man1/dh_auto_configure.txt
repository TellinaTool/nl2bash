NAME
       dh_auto_configure - automatically configure a package prior to building

SYNOPSIS
       dh_auto_configure [build system options] [debhelper options] [-- params]

DESCRIPTION
       dh_auto_configure is a debhelper program that tries to automatically configure a package prior to building.
       It does so by running the appropriate command for the build system it detects the package uses.  For example,
       it looks for and runs a ./configure script, Makefile.PL, Build.PL, or cmake. A standard set of parameters is
       determined and passed to the program that is run. Some build systems, such as make, do not need a configure
       step; for these dh_auto_configure will exit without doing anything.

       This is intended to work for about 90% of packages. If it doesn't work, you're encouraged to skip using
       dh_auto_configure at all, and just run ./configure or its equivalent manually.

OPTIONS
       See "BUILD SYSTEM OPTIONS" in debhelper(7) for a list of common build system selection and control options.

       -- params
           Pass params to the program that is run, after the parameters that dh_auto_configure usually passes. For
           example:

             dh_auto_configure -- --with-foo --enable-bar
