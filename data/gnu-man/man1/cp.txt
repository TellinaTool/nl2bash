NAME
       cp - copy files and directories

SYNOPSIS
       cp [OPTION]... [-T] SOURCE DEST
       cp [OPTION]... SOURCE... DIRECTORY
       cp [OPTION]... -t DIRECTORY SOURCE...

DESCRIPTION
       Copy SOURCE to DEST, or multiple SOURCE(s) to DIRECTORY.

       Mandatory arguments to long options are mandatory for short options too.

       -a, --archive
              same as -dR --preserve=all

       --attributes-only
              don't copy the file data, just the attributes

       --backup[=CONTROL]
              make a backup of each existing destination file

       -b     like --backup but does not accept an argument

       --copy-contents
              copy contents of special files when recursive

       -d     same as --no-dereference --preserve=links

       -f, --force
              if an existing destination file cannot be opened, remove it and try again (this option is ignored when
              the -n option is also used)

       -i, --interactive
              prompt before overwrite (overrides a previous -n option)

       -H     follow command-line symbolic links in SOURCE

       -l, --link
              hard link files instead of copying

       -L, --dereference
              always follow symbolic links in SOURCE

       -n, --no-clobber
              do not overwrite an existing file (overrides a previous -i option)

       -P, --no-dereference
              never follow symbolic links in SOURCE

       -p     same as --preserve=mode,ownership,timestamps

       --preserve[=ATTR_LIST]
              preserve  the  specified  attributes  (default:  mode,ownership,timestamps),  if  possible  additional
              attributes: context, links, xattr, all

       --no-preserve=ATTR_LIST
              don't preserve the specified attributes

       --parents
              use full source file name under DIRECTORY

       -R, -r, --recursive
              copy directories recursively

       --reflink[=WHEN]
              control clone/CoW copies. See below

       --remove-destination
              remove each existing destination file before attempting to open it (contrast with --force)

       --sparse=WHEN
              control creation of sparse files. See below

       --strip-trailing-slashes
              remove any trailing slashes from each SOURCE argument

       -s, --symbolic-link
              make symbolic links instead of copying

       -S, --suffix=SUFFIX
              override the usual backup suffix

       -t, --target-directory=DIRECTORY
              copy all SOURCE arguments into DIRECTORY

       -T, --no-target-directory
              treat DEST as a normal file

       -u, --update
              copy  only  when  the  SOURCE  file is newer than the destination file or when the destination file is
              missing

       -v, --verbose
              explain what is being done

       -x, --one-file-system
              stay on this file system

       --help display this help and exit

       --version
              output version information and exit

       By default, sparse SOURCE files are detected by a crude heuristic and the corresponding  DEST  file  is  made
       sparse  as well.  That is the behavior selected by --sparse=auto.  Specify --sparse=always to create a sparse
       DEST file whenever the SOURCE file contains a long enough sequence of  zero  bytes.   Use  --sparse=never  to
       inhibit creation of sparse files.

       When  --reflink[=always] is specified, perform a lightweight copy, where the data blocks are copied only when
       modified.  If this is not possible the copy fails, or if --reflink=auto is specified, fall back to a standard
       copy.

       The  backup  suffix is '~', unless set with --suffix or SIMPLE_BACKUP_SUFFIX.  The version control method may
       be selected via the --backup option or through the VERSION_CONTROL environment variable.  Here are  the  val‐
       ues:

       none, off
              never make backups (even if --backup is given)

       numbered, t
              make numbered backups

       existing, nil
              numbered if numbered backups exist, simple otherwise

       simple, never
              always make simple backups

       As  a  special  case,  cp makes a backup of SOURCE when the force and backup options are given and SOURCE and
       DEST are the same name for an existing, regular file.
