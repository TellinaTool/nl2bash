LORDER(1)                                    BSD General Commands Manual                                   LORDER(1)

NAME
     lorder — list dependencies for object files

SYNOPSIS
     lorder file ...

DESCRIPTION
     The lorder utility uses nm(1) to determine interdependencies in the list of object files specified on the com‐
     mand line.  lorder outputs a list of file names where the first file contains a symbol which is defined by the
     second file.

     The output is normally used with tsort(1) when a library is created to determine the optimum ordering of the
     object modules so that all references may be resolved in a single pass of the loader.

EXAMPLES
     $ ar cr library.a `lorder ${OBJS} | tsort`

SEE ALSO
