EQN(1)                                         General Commands Manual                                        EQN(1)



NAME
       eqn - format equations for troff or MathML

SYNOPSIS
       eqn [-rvCNR] [-d xy] [-T name] [-M dir] [-f F] [-s n] [-p n] [-m n] [files...]

DESCRIPTION
       This  manual  page  describes  the GNU version of eqn, which is part of the groff document formatting system.
       eqn compiles descriptions of equations embedded within troff input files into commands that are understood by
       troff.   Normally,  it  should  be invoked using the -e option of groff.  The syntax is quite compatible with
       Unix eqn.  The output of GNU eqn cannot be processed with Unix troff; it must be processed  with  GNU  troff.
       If  no  files are given on the command line, the standard input is read.  A filename of - causes the standard
       input to be read.

       eqn  searches  for  the  file  eqnrc  in  the  directories  given  with  the  -M  option   first,   then   in
       /usr/lib/groff/site-tmac,   /usr/share/groff/site-tmac,   and   finally   in  the  standard  macro  directory
       /usr/share/groff/1.22.2/tmac.  If it exists, eqn processes it before the other input files.   The  -R  option
       prevents this.

       GNU  eqn  does  not  provide  the  functionality of neqn: it does not support low-resolution, typewriter-like
       devices (although it may work adequately for very simple input).

OPTIONS
       It is possible to have whitespace between a command line option and its parameter.

       -dxy   Specify delimiters x and y for the left and right end, respectively, of in-line equations.  Any  delim
              statements in the source file overrides this.

       -C     Recognize .EQ and .EN even when followed by a character other than space or newline.  Also, the state‐
              ment `delim on' is not handled specially.

       -N     Don't allow newlines within delimiters.  This option allows eqn to recover better from missing closing
              delimiters.

       -v     Print the version number.

       -r     Only one size reduction.

       -mn    The  minimum point-size is n.  eqn does not reduce the size of subscripts or superscripts to a smaller
              size than n.

       -Tname The output is for device name.  Normally, the only effect of this is to define a  macro  name  with  a
              value of 1; eqnrc uses this to provide definitions appropriate for the output device.  However, if the
              specified device is “MathML”, the output is MathML markup rather than troff commands, and eqnrc is not
              loaded at all.  The default output device is ps.

       -Mdir  Search dir for eqnrc before the default directories.

       -R     Don't load eqnrc.

       -fF    This is equivalent to a gfont F command.

       -sn    This  is  equivalent to a gsize n command.  This option is deprecated.  eqn normally sets equations at
              whatever the current point size is when the equation is encountered.

       -pn    This says that subscripts and superscripts should be n points smaller than the surrounding text.  This
              option  is  deprecated.   Normally eqn sets subscripts and superscripts at 70% of the size of the sur‐
              rounding text.

USAGE
       Only the differences between GNU eqn and Unix eqn are described here.

       GNU eqn emits Presentation MathML output when invoked with the -T MathML option.

       GNU eqn sets the input token "..."  as three periods or low dots, rather than  the  three  centered  dots  of
       classic eqn.  To get three centered dots, write cdots or cdot cdot cdot.

       Most  of  the  new features of the GNU eqn input language are based on TeX.  There are some references to the
       differences between TeX and GNU eqn below; these may safely be ignored if you do not know TeX.

   Controlling delimiters
       If not in compatibility mode, eqn recognizes

              delim on

       to restore the delimiters which have been previously disabled with a call  to  `delim  off'.   If  delimiters
       haven't been specified, the call has no effect.

   Automatic spacing
       eqn  gives  each component of an equation a type, and adjusts the spacing between components using that type.
       Possible types are:

              ordinary     an ordinary character such as `1' or `x';

              operator     a large operator such as `Σ';

              binary       a binary operator such as `+';

              relation     a relation such as `=';

              opening      a opening bracket such as `(';

              closing      a closing bracket such as `)';

              punctuation  a punctuation character such as `,';

              inner        a subformula contained within brackets;

              suppress     spacing that suppresses automatic spacing adjustment.

       Components of an equation get a type in one of two ways.

       type t e
              This yields an equation component that contains e but that has type t, where t is  one  of  the  types
              mentioned above.  For example, times is defined as

                     type "binary" \(mu

              The name of the type doesn't have to be quoted, but quoting protects from macro expansion.

       chartype t text
              Unquoted  groups of characters are split up into individual characters, and the type of each character
              is looked up; this changes the type that is stored for each character; it says that the characters  in
              text from now on have type t.  For example,

                     chartype "punctuation" .,;:

              would make the characters `.,;:' have type punctuation whenever they subsequently appeared in an equa‐
              tion.  The type t can also be letter or digit; in these cases chartype changes the font  type  of  the
              characters.  See the Fonts subsection.

   New primitives
       big e  Enlarges  the  expression  it modifies; intended to have semantics like CSS `large'.  In troff output,
              the point size is increased by 5; in MathML output, the expression uses

                     <mstyle mathsize='big'>

       e1 smallover e2
              This is similar to over; smallover reduces the size of e1 and e2; it also  puts  less  vertical  space
              between  e1  or e2 and the fraction bar.  The over primitive corresponds to the TeX \over primitive in
              display styles; smallover corresponds to \over in non-display styles.

       vcenter e
              This vertically centers e about the math axis.  The math axis is the  vertical  position  about  which
              characters  such  as  `+'  and  `−' are centered; also it is the vertical position used for the bar of
              fractions.  For example, sum is defined as

                     { type "operator" vcenter size +5 \(*S }

              (Note that vcenter is silently ignored when generating MathML.)

       e1 accent e2
              This sets e2 as an accent over e1.  e2 is assumed to be at the correct height for a lowercase  letter;
              e2  is  moved down according to whether e1 is taller or shorter than a lowercase letter.  For example,
              hat is defined as

                     accent { "^" }

              dotdot, dot, tilde, vec, and dyad are also defined using the accent primitive.

       e1 uaccent e2
              This sets e2 as an accent under e1.  e2 is assumed to be at the correct height for a character without
              a  descender;  e2 is moved down if e1 has a descender.  utilde is pre-defined using uaccent as a tilde
              accent below the baseline.

       split "text"
              This has the same effect as simply

                     text

              but text is not subject to macro expansion because it is quoted; text is  split  up  and  the  spacing
              between individual characters is adjusted.

       nosplit text
              This has the same effect as

                     "text"

              but  because text is not quoted it is subject to macro expansion; text is not split up and the spacing
              between individual characters is not adjusted.

       e opprime
              This is a variant of prime that acts as an operator on e.  It produces a different result  from  prime
              in  a  case  such  as  A opprime sub 1: with opprime the 1 is tucked under the prime as a subscript to
              the A (as is conventional in mathematical typesetting), whereas with prime the 1 is a subscript to the
              prime character.  The precedence of opprime is the same as that of bar and under, which is higher than
              that of everything except accent and uaccent.  In unquoted text a ' that is not the first character is
              treated like opprime.

       special text e
              This  constructs a new object from e using a troff(1) macro named text.  When the macro is called, the
              string 0s contains the output for e, and the number registers 0w, 0h, 0d, 0skern,  and  0skew  contain
              the  width,  height,  depth, subscript kern, and skew of e.  (The subscript kern of an object says how
              much a subscript on that object should be tucked in; the skew of an object says how far to  the  right
              of  the center of the object an accent over the object should be placed.)  The macro must modify 0s so
              that it outputs the desired result with its origin at the current point, and increase the current hor‐
              izontal  position by the width of the object.  The number registers must also be modified so that they
              correspond to the result.

              For example, suppose you wanted a construct that `cancels' an expression by drawing  a  diagonal  line
              through it.

                     .EQ
                     define cancel 'special Ca'
                     .EN
                     .de Ca
                     .  ds 0s \
                     \Z'\\*(0s'\
                     \v'\\n(0du'\
                     \D'l \\n(0wu -\\n(0hu-\\n(0du'\
                     \v'\\n(0hu'
                     ..

              Then you could cancel an expression e with cancel { e }

              Here's a more complicated construct that draws a box round an expression:

                     .EQ
                     define box 'special Bx'
                     .EN
                     .de Bx
                     .  ds 0s \
                     \Z'\h'1n'\\*(0s'\
                     \Z'\
                     \v'\\n(0du+1n'\
                     \D'l \\n(0wu+2n 0'\
                     \D'l 0 -\\n(0hu-\\n(0du-2n'\
                     \D'l -\\n(0wu-2n 0'\
                     \D'l 0 \\n(0hu+\\n(0du+2n'\
                     '\
                     \h'\\n(0wu+2n'
                     .  nr 0w +2n
                     .  nr 0d +1n
                     .  nr 0h +1n
                     ..

       space n
              A  positive value of the integer n (in hundredths of an em) sets the vertical spacing before the equa‐
              tion, a negative value sets the spacing after the equation, replacing the default values.  This primi‐
              tive provides an interface to groff's \x escape (but with opposite sign).

              This keyword has no effect if the equation is part of a pic picture.

   Extended primitives
       col n { ... }
       ccol n { ... }
       lcol n { ... }
       rcol n { ... }
       pile n { ... }
       cpile n { ... }
       lpile n { ... }
       rpile n { ... }
              The  integer  value  n  (in  hundredths  of  an em) increases the vertical spacing between rows, using
              groff's \x escape (the value has no effect in MathML mode).  Negative values are possible but have  no
              effect.  If there is more than a single value given in a matrix, the biggest one is used.

   Customization
       When  eqn  is generating troff markup, the appearance of equations is controlled by a large number of parame‐
       ters.  They have no effect when generating MathML mode, which pushes typesetting and fine motions  downstream
       to a MathML rendering engine.  These parameters can be set using the set command.

       set p n
              This sets parameter p to value n; n is an integer.  For example,

                     set x_height 45

              says that eqn should assume an x height of 0.45 ems.

              Possible  parameters  are  as  follows.   Values  are in units of hundredths of an em unless otherwise
              stated.  These descriptions are intended to be expository rather than definitive.

              minimum_size
                     eqn doesn't set anything at a smaller point-size than this.  The value is in points.

              fat_offset
                     The fat primitive emboldens an equation by overprinting two copies of the equation horizontally
                     offset by this amount.  This parameter is not used in MathML mode; instead, fat text uses

                            <mstyle mathvariant='double-struck'>

              over_hang
                     A  fraction  bar is longer by twice this amount than the maximum of the widths of the numerator
                     and denominator; in other words, it overhangs the numerator and denominator by  at  least  this
                     amount.

              accent_width
                     When  bar  or  under is applied to a single character, the line is this long.  Normally, bar or
                     under produces a line whose length is the width of the object to which it applies; in the  case
                     of a single character, this tends to produce a line that looks too long.

              delimiter_factor
                     Extensible  delimiters  produced  with the left and right primitives have a combined height and
                     depth of at least this many thousandths of twice the maximum amount by which  the  sub-equation
                     that the delimiters enclose extends away from the axis.

              delimiter_shortfall
                     Extensible  delimiters  produced  with the left and right primitives have a combined height and
                     depth not less than the difference of twice the maximum amount by which the  sub-equation  that
                     the delimiters enclose extends away from the axis and this amount.

              null_delimiter_space
                     This much horizontal space is inserted on each side of a fraction.

              script_space
                     The width of subscripts and superscripts is increased by this amount.

              thin_space
                     This amount of space is automatically inserted after punctuation characters.

              medium_space
                     This amount of space is automatically inserted on either side of binary operators.

              thick_space
                     This amount of space is automatically inserted on either side of relations.

              x_height
                     The height of lowercase letters without ascenders such as `x'.

              axis_height
                     The height above the baseline of the center of characters such as `+' and `−'.  It is important
                     that this value is correct for the font you are using.

              default_rule_thickness
                     This should set to the thickness of the \(ru character, or the thickness  of  horizontal  lines
                     produced with the \D escape sequence.

              num1   The over command shifts up the numerator by at least this amount.

              num2   The smallover command shifts up the numerator by at least this amount.

              denom1 The over command shifts down the denominator by at least this amount.

              denom2 The smallover command shifts down the denominator by at least this amount.

              sup1   Normally superscripts are shifted up by at least this amount.

              sup2   Superscripts  within  superscripts  or  upper  limits  or numerators of smallover fractions are
                     shifted up by at least this amount.  This is usually less than sup1.

              sup3   Superscripts within denominators or square roots or subscripts or lower limits are  shifted  up
                     by at least this amount.  This is usually less than sup2.

              sub1   Subscripts are normally shifted down by at least this amount.

              sub2   When  there  is  both  a subscript and a superscript, the subscript is shifted down by at least
                     this amount.

              sup_drop
                     The baseline of a superscript is no more than this much amount below the top of the  object  on
                     which the superscript is set.

              sub_drop
                     The  baseline  of a subscript is at least this much below the bottom of the object on which the
                     subscript is set.

              big_op_spacing1
                     The baseline of an upper limit is at least this much above the top of the object on  which  the
                     limit is set.

              big_op_spacing2
                     The baseline of a lower limit is at least this much below the bottom of the object on which the
                     limit is set.

              big_op_spacing3
                     The bottom of an upper limit is at least this much above the top of the  object  on  which  the
                     limit is set.

              big_op_spacing4
                     The  top  of  a  lower  limit is at least this much below the bottom of the object on which the
                     limit is set.

              big_op_spacing5
                     This much vertical space is added above and below limits.

              baseline_sep
                     The baselines of the rows in a pile or matrix are normally this far apart.  In most cases  this
                     should be equal to the sum of num1 and denom1.

              shift_down
                     The  midpoint  between  the top baseline and the bottom baseline in a matrix or pile is shifted
                     down by this much from the axis.  In most cases this should be equal to axis_height.

              column_sep
                     This much space is added between columns in a matrix.

              matrix_side_sep
                     This much space is added at each side of a matrix.

              draw_lines
                     If this is non-zero, lines are drawn using the \D escape sequence,  rather  than  with  the  \l
                     escape sequence and the \(ru character.

              body_height
                     The  amount by which the height of the equation exceeds this is added as extra space before the
                     line containing the equation (using \x).  The default value is 85.

              body_depth
                     The amount by which the depth of the equation exceeds this is added as extra  space  after  the
                     line containing the equation (using \x).  The default value is 35.

              nroff  If this is non-zero, then ndefine behaves like define and tdefine is ignored, otherwise tdefine
                     behaves like define and ndefine is ignored.  The default value is 0 (This is typically  changed
                     to 1 by the eqnrc file for the ascii, latin1, utf8, and cp1047 devices.)

              A  more  precise description of the role of many of these parameters can be found in Appendix H of The
              TeXbook.

   Macros
       Macros can take arguments.  In a macro body, $n where n is between 1 and 9, is replaced by the n-th  argument
       if  the  macro  is  called with arguments; if there are fewer than n arguments, it is replaced by nothing.  A
       word containing a left parenthesis where the part of the word before the left parenthesis  has  been  defined
       using  the  define command is recognized as a macro call with arguments; characters following the left paren‐
       thesis up to a matching right parenthesis are treated as  comma-separated  arguments;  commas  inside  nested
       parentheses do not terminate an argument.

       sdefine name X anything X
              This is like the define command, but name is not recognized if called with arguments.

       include "file"
       copy "file"
              Include the contents of file (include and copy are synonyms).  Lines of file beginning with .EQ or .EN
              are ignored.

       ifdef name X anything X
              If name has been defined by define (or has been automatically  defined  because  name  is  the  output
              device)  process  anything;  otherwise  ignore anything.  X can be any character not appearing in any‐
              thing.

       undef name
              Remove definition of name, making it undefined.

       Besides the macros mentioned above, the following definitions are available: Alpha, Beta, ..., Omega (this is
       the same as ALPHA, BETA, ..., OMEGA), ldots (three dots on the base line), and dollar.

   Fonts
       eqn  normally  uses  at  least two fonts to set an equation: an italic font for letters, and a roman font for
       everything else.  The existing gfont command changes the font that is used as the italic  font.   By  default
       this is I.  The font that is used as the roman font can be changed using the new grfont command.

       grfont f
              Set the roman font to f.

       The  italic  primitive  uses the current italic font set by gfont; the roman primitive uses the current roman
       font set by grfont.  There is also a new gbfont command, which changes the font used by the  bold  primitive.
       If you only use the roman, italic and bold primitives to changes fonts within an equation, you can change all
       the fonts used by your equations just by using gfont, grfont and gbfont commands.

       You can control which characters are treated as letters (and therefore set in italics) by using the  chartype
       command  described  above.   A  type  of letter causes a character to be set in italic type.  A type of digit
       causes a character to be set in roman type.

MATHML MODE LIMITATIONS
       MathML is designed on the assumption that it cannot know the exact physical characteristics of the media  and
       devices  on  which  it  will  be rendered.  It does not support fine control of motions and sizes to the same
       degree troff does.  Thus:

       *      eqn parameters have no effect on the generated MathML.

       *      The special, up, down, fwd, and back operations cannot be implemented, and yield a  MathML  `<merror>'
              message instead.

       *      The vcenter keyword is silently ignored, as centering on the math axis is the MathML default.

       *      Characters that eqn over troff sets extra large – notably the integral sign – may appear too small and
              need to have their `<mstyle>' wrappers adjusted by hand.

       As in its troff mode, eqn in MathML mode leaves the .EQ and .EN delimiters in place for displayed  equations,
       but  emits  no explicit delimiters around inline equations.  They can, however, be recognized as strings that
       begin with `<math>' and end with `</math>' and do not cross line boundaries.

       See the BUGS section for translation limits specific to eqn.

BUGS
       Inline equations are set at the point size that is current at the beginning of the input line.

       In MathML mode, the mark and lineup features don't  work.   These  could,  in  theory,  be  implemented  with
       `<maligngroup>' elements.

       In  MathML  mode,  each  digit  of a numeric literal gets a separate `<mn></mn>' pair, and decimal points are
       tagged with `<mo></mo>'.  This is allowed by the specification, but inefficient.
