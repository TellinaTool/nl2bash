NAME
       ps2ascii - Ghostscript translator from PostScript or PDF to ASCII

SYNOPSIS
       ps2ascii [ input.ps [ output.txt ] ]
       ps2ascii input.pdf [ output.txt ]

DESCRIPTION
       ps2ascii  uses gs(1) to extract ASCII text from PostScript(tm) or Adobe Portable Document Format (PDF) files.
       If no files are specified on the command line, gs reads from standard input; but PDF input must come from  an
       explicitly-named  file,  not  standard  input.   If no output file is specified, the ASCII text is written to
       standard output.

       ps2ascii doesn't look at font encoding, and isn't very good at dealing with kerning, so for  PostScript  (but
       not currently PDF), you might consider pstotext (see below).

FILES
       Run  "gs  -h"  to  find the location of Ghostscript documentation on your system, from which you can get more
       details.
