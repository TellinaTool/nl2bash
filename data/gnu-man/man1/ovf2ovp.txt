NAME
       ovf2ovp - convert a virtual font file and its associated font metric file into property-list format

SYNOPSIS
       ovf2ovp [OPTIONS] OVFNAME[.ovf] [OFMNAME[.ofm] [OVPFILE[.ovp]]]

DESCRIPTION
       ovf2ovp  translates  a  virtual  font (OVF) file, OVFNAME, and its companion font metric (OFM) file, OFMNAME,
       into a human-readable property-list format.  The program writes to standard output (by default) or to a  file
       specified as OVPNAME.

       The  program  also  works  with  TeX  VF and TFM files, producing TeX VP files.  (ovf2ovp is based on the WEB
       source code for vftovp(1).)

OPTIONS
       -charcode-format=TYPE
              output character codes according to TYPE, which can be either `hex' or  `ascii'.   Default  is  `hex'.
              ascii specifes all ASCII letters and digits; hex gets you everything else.

       -help  display a brief summary of syntax and options

       -verbose
              display progress reports

       -version
              output version information and exit

FILES
       OVPFILE
              Omega Virtual Property List file

       OFMNAME

AUTHOR
       According to the WEB documentation:

              VFtoVP is an extended version of the program TFtoPL, which is part of the standard tex()ware  library.
              The  idea  of  a virtual font was inspired by the work of David R. Fuchs who designed a similar set of
              conventions in 1984 while developing a device driver for ArborText, Inc.  He wrote a somewhat  similar
              program called AMFtoXPL.
