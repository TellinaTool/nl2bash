NAME
       pacmd - Reconfigure a PulseAudio sound server during runtime

SYNOPSIS
       pacmd

       pacmd --help

       pacmd --version

DESCRIPTION
       This  tool can be used to introspect or reconfigure a running PulseAudio sound server during runtime. It con‐
       nects to the sound server and offers a simple live shell that can be used to enter the commands  also  under‐
       stood in the default.pa configuration scripts.

       To  exit  the  live shell, use ctrl+d. Note that the 'exit' command inside the shell will tell the PulseAudio
       daemon itself to shutdown!

       If any arguments are passed on the command line, they will be passed into the live shell which  will  process
       the command and exit.
