NAME
       orted - Start an Open RTE User-Level Daemon

SYNOPSIS
       orted [options]

DESCRIPTION
       orted starts an Open RTE daemon for the Open MPI system.

NOTE
       The  orted command is not intended to be manually invoked by end users.  It is part of the Open MPI architec‐
       ture and is invoked automatically as necessary.  This man page is mainly intended for those  adventerous  end
       users and system administrators who have noticed an "orted" process and wondered what it is.

       As  such,  the  command  line  options accepted by the orted are not listed below because they are considered
       internal and are therefore subject to change between versions without warning.  Running orted with the --help
       command line option will show all available options.
