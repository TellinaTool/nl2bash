NAME
       tgatoppm - convert TrueVision Targa file into a portable pixmap


SYNOPSIS
       tgatoppm [--alphaout={alpha-filename,-}] [--headerdump] tga-filename



DESCRIPTION
       Reads a TrueVision Targa file as input.  Produces a portable pixmap as output.


OPTIONS
       --alphaout=alpha-filename
              tgatoppm creates a PGM (portable graymap) file containing the alpha channel values in the input image.
              If the input image doesn't contain an alpha channel, the alpha-filename file contains all zero (trans‐
              parent)  alpha values.  If you don't specify --alphaout, tgatoppm does not generate an alpha file, and
              if the input image has an alpha channel, tgatoppm simply discards it.

              If you specify - as the filename, tgatoppm writes the alpha output to Standard Output and discards the
              image.

              See pnmcomp(1) for one way to use the alpha output file.

       --headerdump
              Causes the header information to be dumped to stderr.

       All options can be abbreviated to their shortest unique prefix.  Should really be in PNM, not PPM.
