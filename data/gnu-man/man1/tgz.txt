NAME
       tgz - makes a gzip'd tar archive

SYNOPSIS
       tgz [ destination [ source ...  ] ]

DESCRIPTION
       Make  a gzip'd tar archive with the name of the first parameter out of specified files or, if no source files
       are specified, from everything in the current directory.  If the first parameter is omitted as well, the  ar‐
       chive will be written to stdout.

BUGS
       tgz  requires  gzip  in  the  user's path.  It also needs gnu tar or something close due to use of --exclude,
       --totals and -S.
