NAME
       iceauth - ICE authority file utility

SYNOPSIS
       iceauth [ -f authfile ] [ -vqib ] [ command arg ... ]

DESCRIPTION
       The  iceauth  program  is used to edit and display the authorization information used in connecting with ICE.
       This program is usually used to extract authorization records from one machine and merge them in  on  another
       (as  is the case when using remote logins or granting access to other users).  Commands (described below) may
       be entered interactively, on the iceauth command line, or in scripts.

OPTIONS
       -f authfile  Name of the authority file to use. Will default to
                    the file currently in use by the session.

       -v           Turns on extra messages (verbose mode)

       -q           Turns off extra messages (quiet mode)

       -i           Ignore the locks on the authority file

       -b           Break the locks on the authority file

       -u           Print basic usage instructions
