NAME
       winicontoppm - convert a Windows .ico file into 1 or more portable pixmap files

SYNOPSIS
       winicontoppm [-writeands] [-allicons|-bestqual] [-multippm] [-verbose] [iconfile] [ppmdestfile]

DESCRIPTION
       Reads a Microsoft Windows .ico file, converts it to one or more ppms.

       A Windows icon contains 1 or more images, at different resolutions and color depths.  Each image has an 'and'
       mask, which contains transparancy data.

       By default, the output goes to Standard Output.  If you specify ppmdestfile, output goes  into  one  or  more
       files named as follows.  If it's just one file (i.e. you specify the -multippm option or don't specify -alli‐
       cons), the file specification is ppmdestfile.ppm.  If it's multiple  files,  their  file  specifications  are
       ppmdestfile_1.ppm, ppmdestfile_2.ppm, etc.

       When  you  specify  the  -writeands  option, the filenames above are modified to include the string xor as in
       ppmdestfile_xor.ppm or ppmdestfile_xor_1.ppm.

       winicontoppm can convert images with 1, 4, 8, 24 or 32 bits per pixel (bpp).


OPTIONS
       -writeands
              For each icon written, also write the 'and' (transparancy) mask as a seperate PBM file.  It's name  is
              of the form ppmdestfile_and.pbm or ppmdestfile_and_1.pbm.

       -allicons
              Extract all images from the .ico file.

       -bestqual
              Extract only the best quality (largest, then highest bpp) image from the .ico file.

       -multippm
              Write all ppms to a single file.
