DESCRIPTION
       icu-config simplifies the task of building and linking against ICU as compared to manually  configuring  user
       makefiles  or equivalent.  Because icu-config is an executable script, it also solves the problem of locating
       the ICU libraries and headers, by allowing the system PATH to locate it.

EXAMPLES
       icu-config can be used without a makefile. The command line below is sufficient for  building  a  single-file
       c++ program against ICU. (For example, icu/source/samples/props/props.cpp)

              `icu-config --cxx --cxxflags --cppflags --ldflags` -o props props.cpp

       More  commonly, icu-config will be called from within a makefile, and used to set up variables. The following
       example also builds the props example.

              CC=$(shell icu-config --cc)

              CXX=$(shell icu-config --cxx)

              CPPFLAGS=$(shell icu-config --cppflags)

              CXXFLAGS=$(shell icu-config --cxxflags)

              LDFLAGS =$(shell icu-config --ldflags)

              all: props

              props.o: props.cpp

       make(1) will automatically use the above variables.

OPTIONS
       --bindir
              Prints the binary (executable) directory path. Normally  equivalent  to  'bin'.   ICU  user-executable
              applications and scripts are found here.

       --cc   Print the C compiler used.  Equivalent to the $(CC) Makefile variable.

       --cflags
              Print  the  C  compiler  flags.  Equivalent to the $(CFLAGS) Makefile variable.  Does NOT include pre‐
              processor directives such as include path or defined symbols.  Examples  include  debugging  (-g)  and
              optimization flags

       --cppflags
              Print  the  C  preprocessor  flags.  Equivalent  to the $(CPPFLAGS) Makefile variable. Examples are -I
              include paths  and -D define directives.

       --cppflags-searchpath
              Print the C preprocessor flags, as above but only -I search paths.

       --cxx  Print the C++ compiler. Equivalent to the $(CXX) Makefile variable.

       --cxxflags
              Print the C++ compiler flags. Equivalent to the $(CXXFLAGS) Makefile variable.

       --detect-prefix
              If ICU has been moved from its installed location, prepending this flag to other icu-config calls will
              attempt to locate ICU relative to where the icu-config script has been located. Can be used as a last-
              chance effort if the ICU install has been damaged.

       --exec-prefix
              Print the prefix used for executable program directories (such as bin, sbin, etc). Normally  the  same
              as the prefix.

       --exists
              Script  will  return  with a successful (0) status if ICU seems to be installed and located correctly,
              otherwise an error message and nonzero status will be displayed.

       --help, -?,--usage
              Print a help and usage message.

       --icudata
              Print the shortname of the ICU data file. This does not include any suffix such as  .dat,  .dll,  .so,
              .lib, .a, etc nor does it include prefixes such as 'lib'.  It may be in the form icudt21b

       --icudata-install-dir
              Print  the  directory where ICU packaged data should be installed.   Can use as pkgdata(1)'s --install
              option.

       --icudata-mode
              Print the default ICU pkgdata mode, such as dll or common.  Can use as pkgdata(1)'s --mode option.

       --icudatadir
              Print the path to packaged archive data.  (should  be  where  $ICU_DATA  or  equivalent  default  path
              points.)  Will NOT point to the libdir.

       --invoke
              If  ICU  is  not  installed in a location where the operating system will locate its shared libraries,
              this option will print out commands so as to set the appropriate environment variables to  load  ICU's
              shared  libraries. For example, on many systems a variable named LD_LIBRARY_PATH or equivalent must be
              set.

       --invoke=prog
              Same as the --invoke option, except includes options for invoking a program named prog.   If  prog  is
              the  name  of  an  ICU tool, such as genrb(1), then icu-config will also include the full path to that
              tool.

       --ldflags
              Print any flags which should be passed to the linker. These may include -L for library  search  paths,
              and  -l  for  including  ICU  libraries.  By default, this option will attempt to link in the "common"
              (libicuuc) and "i18n" (libicui18n) libraries, as well as the data library. If additional libraries are
              required,  any  of  the  following  two  flags  may be added in conjunction with this one, for example
              "--ldflags --ldflags-icuio" if the  icuio  library  is  required  in  addition  to  the  standard  ICU
              libraries.  Equivalent to the $(LDFLAGS) Makefile variable.

       --ldflags-layout
              Prints the link option for the ICU layout library.

       --ldflags-icuio
              Prints the link option to add the ICU I/O package

       --ldflags-libsonly
              Similar to --ldflags but only includes the -l options.

       --ldflags-searchpath
              Similar to --ldflags but only includes the -L search path options.

       --ldflags-system
              Similar  to  --ldflags but only includes system libraries (such as pthreads) --mandir Prints the loca‐
              tion of the installed ICU man pages. Normally (man)

       --prefix
              Prints the prefix (base directory) under which the installed ICU resides.

       --prefix=prefix
              Sets the ICU prefix to prefix for the remainder of this command line.  Does test whether the new  pre‐
              fix is valid.

       --sbindir
              Prints the location of ICU system binaries, normally (sbin)

       --shared-datadir
              Prints the location of ICU shared data, normally (share)

       --sysconfdir
              Prints the location of ICU system configuration data, normally (etc)

       --unicode-version
              Prints the Version of the Unicode Standard which the current ICU uses.

       --version
              Prints the current version of ICU.

       --incfile
              Prints the 'Makefile.inc' path, suitable for use with pkgdata(1)'s -O option.
