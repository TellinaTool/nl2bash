       Description of compile mode:

       Compile a source file into a libtool library object.

       This mode accepts the following additional options:

       -o OUTPUT-FILE
              set the output file name to OUTPUT-FILE

       -no-suppress
              do not suppress compiler output for multiple passes

       -prefer-pic
              try to build PIC objects only

       -prefer-non-pic
              try to build non-PIC objects only

       -shared
              do not build a `.o' file suitable for static linking

       -static
              only build a `.o' file suitable for static linking

       -Wc,FLAG
              pass FLAG directly to the compiler

       COMPILE-COMMAND is a command to be used in creating a `standard' object file from the given SOURCEFILE.

       The output file name is determined by removing the directory component from SOURCEFILE, then substituting the
       C source code suffix `.c' with the library object suffix, `.lo'.

       Description of link mode:

       Link object files or libraries together to form another library, or to create an executable program.

       LINK-COMMAND is a command using the C compiler that you would use to create a  program  from  several  object
       files.

       The following components of LINK-COMMAND are treated specially:

       -all-static
              do not do any dynamic linking at all

       -avoid-version
              do not add a version suffix if possible

       -bindir BINDIR
              specify  path  to binaries directory (for systems where libraries must be found in the PATH setting at
              runtime)

       -dlopen FILE
              `-dlpreopen' FILE if it cannot be dlopened at runtime

       -dlpreopen FILE
              link in FILE and add its symbols to lt_preloaded_symbols

       -export-dynamic
              allow symbols from OUTPUT-FILE to be resolved with dlsym(3)

       -export-symbols SYMFILE
              try to export only the symbols listed in SYMFILE

       -export-symbols-regex REGEX
              try to export only the symbols matching REGEX

       -LLIBDIR
              search LIBDIR for required installed libraries

       -lNAME OUTPUT-FILE requires the installed library libNAME

       -module
              build a library that can dlopened

       -no-fast-install
              disable the fast-install mode

       -no-install
              link a not-installable executable

       -no-undefined
              declare that a library does not refer to external symbols

       -o OUTPUT-FILE
              create OUTPUT-FILE from the specified objects

       -objectlist FILE
              Use a list of object files found in FILE to specify objects

       -precious-files-regex REGEX
              don't remove output files matching REGEX

       -release RELEASE
              specify package release information

       -rpath LIBDIR
              the created library will eventually be installed in LIBDIR

       -R[ ]LIBDIR
              add LIBDIR to the runtime path of programs and libraries

       -shared
              only do dynamic linking of libtool libraries

       -shrext SUFFIX
              override the standard shared library file extension

       -static
              do not do any dynamic linking of uninstalled libtool libraries

       -static-libtool-libs
              do not do any dynamic linking of libtool libraries

       -version-info CURRENT[:REVISION[:AGE]]
              specify library version info [each variable defaults to 0]

       -weak LIBNAME
              declare that the target provides the LIBNAME interface

       -Wc,FLAG

       -Xcompiler FLAG
              pass linker-specific FLAG directly to the compiler

       -Wl,FLAG

       -Xlinker FLAG
              pass linker-specific FLAG directly to the linker

       -XCClinker FLAG
              pass link-specific FLAG to the compiler driver (CC)

       All other options (arguments beginning with `-') are ignored.

       Every other argument is treated as a filename.  Files ending in `.la'  are  treated  as  uninstalled  libtool
       libraries, other files are standard or library object files.

       If  the  OUTPUT-FILE ends in `.la', then a libtool library is created, only library objects (`.lo' files) may
       be specified, and `-rpath' is required, except when creating a convenience library.

       If OUTPUT-FILE ends in `.a' or `.lib', then a standard library is created using `ar' and `ranlib', or on Win‐
       dows using `lib'.

       If  OUTPUT-FILE ends in `.lo' or `.o', then a reloadable object file is created, otherwise an executable pro‐
       gram is created.

       Description of execute mode:

       Automatically set library path, then run a program.

       This mode accepts the following additional options:

       -dlopen FILE
              add the directory containing FILE to the library path

       This mode sets the library path environment variable according to `-dlopen' flags.

       If any of the ARGS are libtool executable wrappers, then they are translated into their  corresponding  unin‐
       stalled binary, and any of their required library directories are added to the library path.

       Then, COMMAND is executed, with ARGS as arguments.

       Description of install mode:

       Install executables or libraries.

       INSTALL-COMMAND is the installation command.  The first component should be either the `install' or `cp' pro‐
       gram.

       The following components of INSTALL-COMMAND are treated specially:

       -inst-prefix-dir PREFIX-DIR
              Use PREFIX-DIR as a staging area for installation

       The rest of the components are interpreted as arguments to that command (only BSD-compatible install  options
       are recognized).

       Description of finish mode:

       Complete the installation of libtool libraries.

       Each LIBDIR is a directory that contains libtool libraries.

       The  commands  that  this  mode executes may require superuser privileges.  Use the `--dry-run' option if you
       just want to see what would be executed.

       Description of uninstall mode:

       Remove libraries from an installation directory.

       RM is the name of the program to use to  delete  files  associated  with  each  FILE  (typically  `/bin/rm').
       RM-OPTIONS are options (such as `-f') to be passed to RM.

       If  FILE  is a libtool library, all the files associated with it are deleted.  Otherwise, only FILE itself is
       deleted using RM.

       Description of clean mode:

       Remove files from the build directory.

       RM is the name of the program to use to  delete  files  associated  with  each  FILE  (typically  `/bin/rm').
       RM-OPTIONS are options (such as `-f') to be passed to RM.

       If  FILE  is  a  libtool library, object or program, all the files associated with it are deleted. Otherwise,
       only FILE itself is deleted using RM.
