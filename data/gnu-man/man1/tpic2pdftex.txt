NAME
       tpic2pdftex - convert tpic \specials for use by pdftex


SYNOPSIS
       pic -t somefile.pic | tpic2pdftex > somefile.tex

       Process somefile.tex by pdftex/pdflatex.


DESCRIPTION
       Experimental  awk  script for conversion of tpic \specials as produced by (groff-)pic into pdfTeX \pdfliteral
       sections for further processing by pdftex.

       Current version: 1.97.

       tpic \special description see e. g.: Goossens, Rahtz, Mittelbach: The LaTeX Graphics Companion,  Addison-Wes‐

BUGS
       Spline  curve  shapes not fully authentic (unknown algorithm).  Bounding box does not care for line thickness
       (groff pic feature).  Splines might be outside bounding box.  Fill color does not work correctly  for  arrow‐
       heads (pic limitation).
