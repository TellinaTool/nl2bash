NAME
       ppmtotga - convert portable pixmap into a TrueVision Targa file

SYNOPSIS
       ppmtotga [-mono|-cmap|-rgb] [-norle] [ppmfile]

DESCRIPTION
       Reads a portable pixmap as input.  Produces a TrueVision Targa file as output.

OPTIONS
       -mono  Forces  Targa  file  to  be  of  type 8 bit monochrome.  Input must be a portable bitmap or a portable
              graymap.

       -cmap  Forces Targa file to be of type 24 bit colormapped.  Input must  be  a  portable  bitmap,  a  portable
              graymap or a portable pixmap containing no more than 256 distinct colors.

       -rgb   Forces Targa file to be of type 24 bit unmapped color.

       -norle Disables  run-length  encoding,  in  case  you have a Targa reader which can't read run-length encoded
              files.

       All flags can be abbreviated to their shortest unique prefix.  If no file type is specified the  most  highly
       constained  compatible  type  is  used, where monochrome is more constained than colormapped which is in turn
       more constained than unmapped.

BUGS
       Does not support all possible Targa file types.  Should really be in PNM, not PPM.
