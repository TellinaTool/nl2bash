PSTREE(1)                                           User Commands                                          PSTREE(1)



NAME
       pstree - display a tree of processes

SYNOPSIS
       pstree [-a, --arguments] [-c, --compact] [-h, --highlight-all, -Hpid, --highlight-pid pid] [-g] --show-pgids]
       [-l, --long] [-n, --numeric-sort] [-p, --show-pids] [-s, --show-parents] [-u, --uid-changes] [-Z, --secu‐
       rity-context] [-A, --ascii, -G, --vt100, -U, --unicode] [pid, user]
       pstree -V, --version

DESCRIPTION
       pstree  shows running processes as a tree.  The tree is rooted at either pid or init if pid is omitted.  If a
       user name is specified, all process trees rooted at processes owned by that user are shown.

       pstree visually merges identical branches by putting them in square brackets and prefixing them with the rep‐
       etition count, e.g.

           init-+-getty
                |-getty
                |-getty
                `-getty

       becomes

           init---4*[getty]


       Child  threads  of  a process are found under the parent process and are shown with the process name in curly
       braces, e.g.

           icecast2---13*[{icecast2}]


       If pstree is called as pstree.x11 then it will prompt the user at the end of the line  to  press  return  and
       will not return until that has happened.  This is useful for when pstree is run in a xterminal.

       Certain  kernel  or  mount  parameters, such as the hidepid option for procfs, will hide information for some
       processes. In these situations pstree will attempt to  build  the  tree  without  this  information,  showing
       process names as question marks.


OPTIONS
       -a     Show  command  line arguments.  If the command line of a process is swapped out, that process is shown
              in parentheses.  -a implicitly disables compaction for processes but not threads.

       -A     Use ASCII characters to draw the tree.

       -c     Disable compaction of identical subtrees.  By default, subtrees are compacted whenever possible.

       -G     Use VT100 line drawing characters.

       -h     Highlight the current process and its ancestors.  This is a no-op  if  the  terminal  doesn't  support
              highlighting  or  if  neither  the  current  process nor any of its ancestors are in the subtree being
              shown.

       -H     Like -h, but highlight the specified process instead.  Unlike with -h, pstree fails when using  -H  if
              highlighting is not available.

       -g     Show  PGIDs.   Process  Group IDs are shown as decimal numbers in parentheses after each process name.
              -p implicitly disables compaction.  If both PIDs and PGIDs are displayed then PIDs are shown first.

       -l     Display long lines.  By default, lines are truncated to the display width or 132 if output is sent  to
              a non-tty or if the display width is unknown.

       -n     Sort processes with the same ancestor by PID instead of by name.  (Numeric sort.)

       -p     Show  PIDs.   PIDs are shown as decimal numbers in parentheses after each process name.  -p implicitly
              disables compaction.

       -s     Show parent processes of the specified process.

       -u     Show uid transitions.  Whenever the uid of a process differs from the uid of its parent, the  new  uid
              is shown in parentheses after the process name.

       -U     Use  UTF-8  (Unicode) line drawing characters.  Under Linux 1.1-54 and above, UTF-8 mode is entered on
              the console with echo -e ' 33%8' and left with echo -e ' 33%@'

       -V     Display version information.

       -Z     (SELinux) Show security context for each process.  This flag will only work  if  pstree  is  compilied
              with SELinux support.

FILES
       /proc  location of the proc file system

BUGS
       Some character sets may be incompatible with the VT100 characters.
