dbus-cleanup-sockets(1)                        General Commands Manual                       dbus-cleanup-sockets(1)



NAME
       dbus-cleanup-sockets - clean up leftover sockets in a directory

SYNOPSIS
       dbus-cleanup-sockets [DIRECTORY]


DESCRIPTION
       The  dbus-cleanup-sockets  command  cleans  up  unused  D-Bus  connection  sockets.  See http://www.freedesk‐
       top.org/software/dbus/ for more information about the big picture.


       If given no arguments, dbus-cleanup-sockets cleans up sockets in the standard default  socket  directory  for
       the per-user-login-session message bus; this is usually /tmp.  Optionally, you can pass a different directory
       on the command line.


       On Linux, this program is essentially useless, because D-Bus defaults to using "abstract sockets" that  exist
       only in memory and don't have a corresponding file in /tmp.


       On  most  other  flavors  of  UNIX, it's possible for the socket files to leak when programs using D-Bus exit
       abnormally  or  without  closing  their  D-Bus  connections.  Thus,  it   might   be   interesting   to   run
       dbus-cleanup-sockets  in a cron job to mop up any leaked sockets.  Or you can just ignore the leaked sockets,
       they aren't really hurting anything, other than cluttering the output of "ls /tmp"
