TAIL(1)                                             User Commands                                            TAIL(1)



NAME
       tail - output the last part of files

SYNOPSIS
       tail [OPTION]... [FILE]...

DESCRIPTION
       Print the last 10 lines of each FILE to standard output.  With more than one FILE, precede each with a header
       giving the file name.  With no FILE, or when FILE is -, read standard input.

       Mandatory arguments to long options are mandatory for short options too.

       -c, --bytes=K
              output the last K bytes; alternatively, use -c +K to output bytes starting with the Kth of each file

       -f, --follow[={name|descriptor}]
              output appended data as the file grows; -f, --follow, and --follow=descriptor are equivalent

       -F     same as --follow=name --retry

       -n, --lines=K
              output the last K lines, instead of the last 10; or use -n +K to output lines starting with the Kth

       --max-unchanged-stats=N
              with --follow=name, reopen a FILE which has not changed size after N (default 5) iterations to see  if
              it  has  been  unlinked  or renamed (this is the usual case of rotated log files).  With inotify, this
              option is rarely useful.

       --pid=PID
              with -f, terminate after process ID, PID dies

       -q, --quiet, --silent
              never output headers giving file names

       --retry
              keep trying to open a file even when it is or becomes inaccessible; useful  when  following  by  name,
              i.e., with --follow=name

       -s, --sleep-interval=N
              with  -f,  sleep  for  approximately  N  seconds  (default  1.0) between iterations.  With inotify and
              --pid=P, check process P at least once every N seconds.

       -v, --verbose
              always output headers giving file names

       --help display this help and exit

       --version
              output version information and exit

       If the first character of K (the number of bytes or lines) is a '+', print beginning with the Kth  item  from
       the  start  of  each  file, otherwise, print the last K items in the file.  K may have a multiplier suffix: b
       512, kB 1000, K 1024, MB 1000*1000, M 1024*1024, GB 1000*1000*1000, G 1024*1024*1024, and so on for T, P,  E,
       Z, Y.

       With  --follow  (-f), tail defaults to following the file descriptor, which means that even if a tail'ed file
       is renamed, tail will continue to track its end.  This default behavior is not desirable when you really want
       to  track  the  actual  name of the file, not the file descriptor (e.g., log rotation).  Use --follow=name in
       that case.  That causes tail to track the named file in a way that accommodates renaming,  removal  and  cre‐
       ation.
