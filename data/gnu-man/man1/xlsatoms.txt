XLSATOMS(1)                                    General Commands Manual                                   XLSATOMS(1)



NAME
       xlsatoms - list interned atoms defined on server

SYNOPSIS
       xlsatoms [-options ...]

DESCRIPTION
       Xlsatoms  lists  the interned atoms.  By default, all atoms starting from 1 (the lowest atom value defined by
       the protocol) are listed until unknown atom is found.  If an explicit range is given, xlsatoms will  try  all
       atoms in the range, regardless of whether or not any are undefined.

OPTIONS
       -display dpy
               This option specifies the X server to which to connect.

       -format string
               This option specifies a printf-style string used to list each atom <value,name> pair, printed in that
               order (value is an unsigned long and name is a char *).  Xlsatoms will supply a newline at the end of
               each line.  The default is %ld\t%s.

       -range [low]-[high]
               This  option specifies the range of atom values to check.  If low is not given, a value of 1 assumed.
               If high is not given, xlsatoms will stop at the first undefined atom at or above low.

       -name string
               This option specifies the name of an atom to list.  If the atom does not exist,  a  message  will  be
               printed on the standard error.
