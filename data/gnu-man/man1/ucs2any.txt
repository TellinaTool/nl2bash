NAME
       ucs2any - generate BDF fonts containing subsets of ISO 10646-1 codepoints

SYNOPSIS
       ucs2any [ +d | -d ] source-name { mapping-file registry-encoding } ...

DESCRIPTION
       ucs2any allows one to generate from an ISO 10646-1 encoded BDF font other BDF fonts in any possible encoding.
       This way, one can derive from a single ISO 10646-1 master font a whole set of 8-bit fonts in all ISO 8859 and
       various other encodings.

OPTIONS
       +d     puts DEC VT100 graphics characters in the C0 range (default for upright, character-cell fonts).

       -d     omits  DEC  VT100  graphics  characters  from the C0 range (default for all font types except upright,
              character-cell fonts).

OPERANDS
       source-name
              is the name of an ISO 10646-1 encoded BDF file.

       mapping-file
              is the name of a character set table like those  at  <ftp://ftp.unicode.org/Public/MAPPINGS/>.   These
              files can also typically be found installed in the /usr/share/fonts/X11/util directory.

       registry-encoding
              are  the  CHARSET_REGISTRY  and  CHARSET_ENCODING  field values for the font name (XLFD) of the target
              font, separated by a hyphen.

       Any number of mapping-file and registry-encoding operand pairs may be specified.

EXAMPLE
       The command
              ucs2any 6x13.bdf 8859-1.TXT iso8859-1 8859-2.TXT iso8859-2
       will generate the files 6x13-iso8859-1.bdf and 6x13-iso8859-2.bdf.

FUTURE DIRECTIONS
       Hopefully a future release will have a facility similar to ucs2any built into the server,  and  reencode  ISO
       10646-1  on the fly, because storing the same fonts in many different encodings is clearly a waste of storage
       capacity.
