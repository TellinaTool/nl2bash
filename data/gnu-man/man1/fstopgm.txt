NAME
       fstopgm - convert a Usenix FaceSaver(tm) file into a portable graymap

SYNOPSIS
       fstopgm [fsfile]

DESCRIPTION
       Reads a Usenix FaceSaver(tm) file as input.  Produces a portable graymap as output.

       FaceSaver(tm)  files sometimes have rectangular pixels.  While fstopgm won't re-scale them into square pixels
       for you, it will give you the precise pnmscale command that will do the job.   Because  of  this,  reading  a
       FaceSaver(tm) image is a two-step process.  First you do:
         fstopgm > /dev/null
       This will tell you whether you need to use pnmscale.  Then use one of the following pipelines:
         fstopgm | pgmnorm
         fstopgm | pnmscale -whatever | pgmnorm
       To go to PBM, you want something more like one of these:
         fstopgm | pnmenlarge 3 | pgmnorm | pgmtopbm
         fstopgm | pnmenlarge 3 | pnmscale <whatever> | pgmnorm | pgmtopbm
       You want to enlarge when going to a bitmap because otherwise you lose information; but enlarging by more than
       3 does not look good.
