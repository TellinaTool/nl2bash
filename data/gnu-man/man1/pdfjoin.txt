NAME
       pdfjoin - join together pages from multiple PDF files

SYNOPSIS
       pdfjoin [OPTION [OPTION] ...] [SRC [PAGESPEC] [SRC [PAGESPEC]] ...]

DESCRIPTION
       pdfjoin concatenates the pages of multiple Portable Document Format (PDF) files together into a single file..

       If  no  source  PDF  file  ('SRC')  is  specified, input (but just one file -- not very useful here!  is from
       /dev/stdin. If 'PAGESPEC' is omitted, all pages are processed.

       Source files are processed sequentially into a single output.  The '--batch' option of  pdfjam(1)  cannot  be
       used.

       pdfjoin  is  a  simple wrapper for pdfjam, which provides a front end to many of the capabilities of the pdf‐
       pages package for pdflatex.  A working installation of pdflatex, with the pdfpages package, is required.

       pdfjoin is part of the "PDFjam" package of tools, whose homepage is at http://go.warwick.ac.uk/pdfjam .
