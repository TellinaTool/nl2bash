usb-devices(1)                                   Linux USB Utilities                                  usb-devices(1)



NAME
       usb-devices - print USB device details

SYNOPSIS
       usb-devices


DESCRIPTION
       usb-devices  is  a (bash) shell script that can be used to display details of USB buses in the system and the
       devices connected to them.

       The output of the script is similar to the usb/devices file available either under  /proc/bus  (if  usbfs  is
       mounted),  or  under  /sys/kernel/debug (if debugfs is mounted there). The script is primarily intended to be
       used if the file is not available.

       In contrast to the usb/devices file, this script only lists active interfaces (those marked with a "*" in the
       usb/devices file) and their endpoints.

       Be  advised  that  there can be differences in the way information is sorted, as well as in the format of the
       output.


RETURN VALUE
       If sysfs is not mounted, a non-zero exit code is returned.


FILES
       /sys/bus/usb/devices/usb*
              The part of the sysfs tree the script walks through to assemble the printed information.

       /proc/bus/usb/devices
              Location where the usb/devices file can normally be found for Linux kernels before 2.6.31, if usbfs is
              mounted.

       /sys/kernel/debug/usb/devices
              Location  where  the  usb/devices  file  can  normally  be found for Linux kernel 2.6.31 and later, if
              debugfs is mounted.
