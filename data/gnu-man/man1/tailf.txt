TAILF(1)                                            User Commands                                           TAILF(1)



NAME
       tailf - follow the growth of a log file

SYNOPSIS
       tailf [OPTION] file

DESCRIPTION
       tailf  will  print out the last 10 lines of a file and then wait for the file to grow.  It is similar to tail
       -f but does not access the file when it is not growing.  This has the side effect of not updating the  access
       time for the file, so a filesystem flush does not occur periodically when no log activity is happening.

       tailf  is  extremely  useful  for  monitoring  log  files on a laptop when logging is infrequent and the user
       desires that the hard disk spin down to conserve battery life.

       Mandatory arguments to long options are mandatory for short options too.

       -n, --lines=N, -N
              output the last N lines, instead of the last 10.

       -V, --version
              Output version information and exit.

       -h, --help
              Display help and exit.
