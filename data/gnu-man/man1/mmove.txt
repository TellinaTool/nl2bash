mmove(1)                                       General Commands Manual                                      mmove(1)



Name
       mmove - move or rename an MSDOS file or subdirectory



Note of warning
       This  manpage  has  been automatically generated from mtools's texinfo documentation, and may not be entirely
       accurate or complete.  See the end of this man page for details.

Description
       The mmove command is used to moves or renames an existing MS-DOS file or subdirectory.
       mmove [-v] [-D clash_option] sourcefile targetfile
       mmove [-v]  [-D clash_option] sourcefile [ sourcefiles... ] targetdirectory

       Mmove moves or renames an existing MS-DOS file or subdirectory. Unlike the MS-DOS version of MOVE,  mmove  is
       able  to  move subdirectories.  Files or directories can only be moved within one file system. Data cannot be
       moved from MS-DOS to Unix or vice-versa.  If you omit the drive letter from the target file or directory, the
       same  letter  as  for  the  source is assumed.  If you omit the drive letter from all parameters, drive a: is
       assumed by default.

Viewing the texi doc
       This manpage has been automatically generated from mtools's texinfo documentation. However, this  process  is
       only  approximative, and some items, such as crossreferences, footnotes and indices are lost in this transla‐
       tion process.  Indeed, these items have no appropriate representation in the manpage format.   Moreover,  not
       all information has been translated into the manpage version.  Thus I strongly advise you to use the original
       texinfo doc.  See the end of this manpage for instructions how to view the texinfo doc.

       *      To generate a printable copy from the texinfo doc, run the following commands:

                     ./configure; make dvi; dvips mtools.dvi



       *      To generate a html copy,  run:

                     ./configure; make html

       A premade html can be found at `http://www.gnu.org/software/mtools/manual/mtools.html'

       *      To generate an info copy (browsable using emacs' info mode), run:

                     ./configure; make info



       The texinfo doc looks most pretty when printed or as html.  Indeed, in the info version certain examples  are
       difficult to read due to the quoting conventions used in info.
