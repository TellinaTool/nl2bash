NAME
       bonobo-activation-server - GNOME component tracker

DESCRIPTION
       This  application  tracks  information about installed components and brokers components, in conjunction with
       its client library; libbonobo-activation.

       It reads the component descriptions from ${prefix}/lib/bonobo/servers/*.server.  These files provide  an  XML
       description  of  a  components  capabilities  which can be queried and manipulated by clients from the client
       library.

       Bonobo-activation-server also ensures that the minimum neccessary number of servers for  your  display  setup
       are running.

       Bonobo-activation-server  executes  all  components  with the environment inherited from the first process to
       start the server. In addition to using your prefix,  it  will  examine  the  BONOBO_ACTIVATION_PATH  and  the
       GNOME2_PATH environment variables to find .server files.

       In  addition  it examines an XML configuration file in ${prefix}/etc/bonobo-activation/bonobo-activation-con‐
       fig.xml
