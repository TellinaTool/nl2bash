DVICONCAT(1)                                   General Commands Manual                                  DVICONCAT(1)



NAME
       dviconcat - concatenate DVI files

SYNOPSIS
       dviconcat [ -m magnification ] [ -o outfile ] list of files

DESCRIPTION
       Dviconcat concatenates the named files (or standard input, if no file names are given) onto the standard out‐
       put or the given outfile, creating a new DVI file usable by any of the TeX conversion programs,  or  even  by
       dviconcat itself.

       The  magnification  of  the  output  file is the same as that of the first input file unless the -m option is
       given.  When dviconcat changes the magnification of any input file, it prints a warning to this effect.

BUGS
       The program should be called dvicat, but that name was taken (for the driver for the C/A/T typesetter).
