NAME
       pdfbook - put the pages of PDF files into 2-up signatures

SYNOPSIS
       pdfbook [--short-edge] [OPTION [OPTION] ...] [SRC [PAGESPEC] [SRC [PAGESPEC]] ...]

DESCRIPTION
       pdfbook  makes  2-up versions of PDF files, with the pages ordered as signatures.  The default signature size
       is 4: to change this, use the option '--signature N', where N is a multiple of 4 (alternatively use '--signa‐
       ture* N' for right-edge binding).

       The  default  is to make pages suitable for long-edge binding.  For short-edge binding, use '--short-edge' as
       the first argument; this will only work if the LaTeX package 'everyshi' is installed.

       The default output page orientation is landscape.  To change this, use the '--no-landscape' option.

       By default, the option '--booklet true' is used (see the pdfpages manual for details).   To  turn  this  off,
       just specify '--booklet false'.

       If no source PDF file ('SRC') is specified, input is from /dev/stdin. If 'PAGESPEC' is omitted, all pages are
       processed.

       Source files are processed sequentially into a single output unless the '--batch' option is  used,  in  which
       case they are processed separately.

       pdfbook  is  a  simple wrapper for pdfjam, which provides a front end to many of the capabilities of the pdf‐
       pages package for pdflatex.  A working installation of pdflatex, with the pdfpages package, is required.

       pdfbook operates on one or more PDF files, and (either with the '--batch'  option  or  with  '--outfile  DIR'
       where  'DIR'  is  a directory) the resulting files have the suffix '-book' applied to their names by default.
       To change the suffix, use the '--suffix' option, for example

              pdfbook --suffix 'sig4' --batch myfile1.pdf myfile2.pdf

       will result in files named 'myfile1-sig4.pdf' and 'myfile2-sig4.pdf'.

       pdfbook is part of the "PDFjam" package of tools, whose homepage is at http://www.warwick.ac.uk/go/pdfjam.
