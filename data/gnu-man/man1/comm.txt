NAME
       comm - compare two sorted files line by line

SYNOPSIS
       comm [OPTION]... FILE1 FILE2

DESCRIPTION
       Compare sorted files FILE1 and FILE2 line by line.

       With no options, produce three-column output.  Column one contains lines unique to FILE1, column two contains
       lines unique to FILE2, and column three contains lines common to both files.

       -1     suppress column 1 (lines unique to FILE1)

       -2     suppress column 2 (lines unique to FILE2)

       -3     suppress column 3 (lines that appear in both files)

       --check-order
              check that the input is correctly sorted, even if all input lines are pairable

       --nocheck-order
              do not check that the input is correctly sorted

       --output-delimiter=STR
              separate columns with STR

       --help display this help and exit

       --version
              output version information and exit

       Note, comparisons honor the rules specified by 'LC_COLLATE'.
