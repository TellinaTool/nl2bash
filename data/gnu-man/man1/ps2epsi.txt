NAME
       ps2epsi - generate conforming Encapsulated PostScript

SYNOPSIS
       ps2epsi infile.ps [ outfile.epsi ] (Unix)
       ps2epsi infile.ps [ outfile.epi ] (DOS)

DESCRIPTION
       ps2epsi  uses  gs(1)  to  process  a  PostScript(tm) file and generate as output a new file which conforms to
       Adobe's Encapsulated PostScript Interchange (EPSI) format.  EPSI is a special form of encapsulated PostScript
       (EPS)  which  adds to the beginning of the file in the form of PostScript comments a bitmapped version of the
       final displayed page.  Programs which understand EPSI (usually word processors or DTP programs) can use  this
       bitmap  to  give a preview version on screen of the PostScript.  The displayed quality is often not very good
       (e.g., low resolution, no colours), but the final printed version uses the real PostScript, and thus has  the
       normal PostScript quality.

USAGE
       On Unix systems invoke ps2epsi like this:

            ps2epsi infile.ps [ outfile.epsi ]

       where "infile.ps" is the input file and "outfile.epsi" is the resulting EPSI file.  If the output filename is
       omitted, it is generated from the input filename.  When  a  standard  extension  (".ps",  ".cps",  ".eps"  or
       ".epsf") is used, it is replaced with the output extension ".epsi".  On DOS systems the command is:

            ps2epsi infile.ps outfile.epi

       where "infile.ps" is the original PostScript file, and "outfile.epi" is the name of the output file.

LIMITATIONS
       Not every PostScript file can be encapsulated successfully, because there are restrictions on what PostScript
       constructs a correct encapsulated file may contain.  ps2epsi does a little extra work to try to help encapsu‐
       lation,  and  it automatically calculates the bounding box required for all encapsulated PostScript files, so
       most of the time it does a pretty good job. There are certain to be cases, however, where  the  encapsulation
       does not work because of the content of the original PostScript file.

COMPATIBILITY
       The  Framemaker  DTP system is one application which understands EPSI files, and ps2epsi has been tested on a
       number of PostScript diagrams from a  variety  of  sources,  using  Framemaker  3.0  on  a  Sun  workstation.
       Framemaker on other platforms should be able to use these files, although I have not been able to test this.
