NAME
       dh_installxmlcatalogs - install and register XML catalog files

SYNOPSIS
       dh_installxmlcatalogs [debhelper options] [-n]

DESCRIPTION
       dh_installxmlcatalogs is a debhelper program that installs and registers XML catalog files.  It complies with
       the Debian XML/SGML policy.

       The file debian/package.xmlcatalogs lists the local XML catalog files to be installed per package as well as
       the XML entities in those local XML catalog files that are to be registered in the XML catalog system.

       The local XML catalog file entries in that file should be of the form "local;source;dest", where the verbatim
       "local" indicates this is an entry for a local XML catalog file, "source" indicates where the local XML
       catalog resides in the source tree, and "dest" indicates the destination location for the local XML catalog
       under the package build area.  "dest" should start with /usr/share/xml/.

       The entries for the XML entities to be registered in the package XML catalog file should be of the form
       "package;type;id;catalog", where the verbatim "package" indicates this is an entry for an XML entity to be
       registered in the package XML catalog file, "type" indicates the XML entity type (public, system, uri), "id"
       indicates the XML entity id, and "catalog" indicates the local XML catalog file.

       The entries for the XML entities to be registered in the root XML catalog file should be of the form
       "root;type;id", where the verbatim "root" indicates this is an entry for an XML entity to be registered in
       the root XML catalog file, "type" indicates the XML entity type (public, system, uri), and "id" indicates the
       XML entity id.

       If an entry for is to be registered identically in the root catalog and the package catalog file, you can use
       the form "root-and-package;type;id;catalog", where the verbatim "root-and-package" indicates this is an entry
       for an XML entity to be registered in both the root and package XML catalog files, "type" indicates the XML
       entity type (public, system, uri), "id" indicates the XML entity id, and "catalog" indicates the local XML
       catalog file.

       XML entity types are described in update-xmlcatalog(8).  Using the "root" or "package" commands, a type of
       "public" will general "delegatePublic" statements in the applicable catalog file. Generally you will want to
       use the types "public" for any formal public identifiers, and "system" for any files on the local filesystem
       or URLs.  "uri" is only used for non-local files which are not part of the external document subset, e.g.,
       they are not used for entities or DTDs.

       dh_installxmlcatalogs automatically adds maintainer script snippets for the registration and unregistration
       of the listed XML entities in the XML catalog system (unless -n is used).  A dependency on the xml-core
       package will be added to "${misc:Depends}", so be sure to use that variable in the file debian/control.  See
       dh_installdeb(1) for an explanation of Debhelper maintainer script snippets.

OPTIONS
       -n, --noscripts
           Do not modify postinst/postrm/prerm scripts.

NOTES
       Note that this command is not idempotent. "dh_clean -k" should be called between invocations of this command.
       Otherwise, it may cause multiple instances of the same text to be added to maintainer scripts.
