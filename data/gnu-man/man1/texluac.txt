NAME
       luatex, texlua, texluac - An extended version of pdfTeX using Lua as an embedded scripting language

SYNOPSIS
       luatex [--lua=FILE] [OPTION]... [TEXNAME[.tex]] [COMMANDS]

       luatex [--lua=FILE] [OPTION]... \FIRST-LINE

       luatex [--lua=FILE] [OPTION]... &FMT ARGS

DESCRIPTION
       Run  the  luaTeX typesetter on TEXNAME, usually creating TEXNAME.pdf. Any remaining COMMANDS are processed as
       luaTeX input, after TEXNAME is read.

       Alternatively, if the first non-option argument begins with a backslash, interpret all  non-option  arguments
       as a line of luaTeX input.

       Alternatively,  if  the first non-option argument begins with a &, the next word is taken as the FMT to read,
       overriding all else. Any remaining arguments are processed as above.

       If no arguments or options are specified, prompt for input.

       If called as texlua it acts as lua interpreter.  If called as texluac it acts as lua bytecode compiler.

       LuaTeX is an extended version of pdfTeX with Unicode and OpenType font support, embeded  Lua  scripting  lan‐
       guage,  the  e-TeX  and Omega extensions, as well as integrated MetaPost engine, that can create PDF files as
       well as DVI files.  For more information about luatex, see http://www.luatex.org, you can read LuaTeX  manual
       using texdoc utility (texdoc luatex).

       All LuaTeX text input and output is considered to be Unicode text.

       In DVI mode, luaTeX can be used as a complete replacement for the TeX engine.

       In PDF mode, luaTeX can natively handle the PDF, JPG, JBIG2, and PNG graphics formats.  luaTeX cannot include
       PostScript or Encapsulated PostScript (EPS) graphics files; first convert them to PDF using epstopdf (1).


OPTIONS
       When the LuaTeX executable starts, it looks for the --lua commandline option.  If there is no  --lua  option,
       the  commandline is interpreted in a similar fashion as in traditional pdfTeX and Aleph. But if the option is
       present, LuaTeX will enter an alternative mode of commandline parsing in comparison  to  the  standard  web2c
       programs.  The  presence of --lua makes most of other options unreliable, because the lua initialization file
       can disable kpathsea and/or hook functions into various callbacks.

       --lua=FILE
              The lua initialization file.

       The following two options alter the executable behaviour:

       --luaonly
              Start LuaTeX as a Lua interpreter. In this mode, it will set Lua's arg[0] to the  found  script  name,
              pushing  preceding  options in negative values and the rest of the commandline in the positive values,
              just like the Lua interpreter. LuaTeX will exit immediately after executing the specified Lua script.

       --luaconly
              Start LuaTeX as a Lua byte compiler. In this mode, LuaTeX is exactly like luac from the standalone Lua
              distribution, except that it does not have the -l switch, and that it accepts (but ignores) the --lua‐
              conly switch.

       Then the regular web2c options:

       --debug-format
              Debug format loading.

       --draftmode
              Sets \pdfdraftmode so luaTeX doesn't write a PDF and doesn't read any included images,  thus  speeding
              up execution.

       --enable-write18
              Synonym for --shell-escape.

       --disable-write18
              Synonym for --no-shell-escape.

       --shell-escape
              Enable  the  \write18{command}  construct,  and Lua functions os.execute(), os.exec(), os.spawn(), and
              io.popen().  The command can be any shell command.  This construct is normally disallowed for security
              reasons.

       --no-shell-escape
              Disable  the  \write18{command}  construct  and  the other Lua functions, even if it is enabled in the
              texmf.cnf file.

       --shell-restricted
              Enable restricted version of \write18, os.execute(), os.exec(), os.spawn(), and io.popen(), only  com‐
              mands listed in texmf.cnf file are allowed.

       --file-line-error
              Print  error  messages  in  the form file:line:error which is similar to the way many compilers format
              them.

       --no-file-line-error
              Disable printing error messages in the file:line:error style.

       --fmt=FORMAT
              Use FORMAT as the name of the format to be used, instead of the name by which luaTeX was called  or  a
              %& line.

       --help Print help message and exit.

       --ini  Start  in  INI  mode, which is used to dump formats.  The INI mode can be used for typesetting, but no
              format is preloaded, and basic initializations like setting catcodes may be required.

       --interaction=MODE
              Sets the interaction mode.  The MODE can be either batchmode, nonstopmode, scrollmode, and  errorstop‐
              mode.  The meaning of these modes is the same as that of the corresponding \commands.

       --jobname=NAME
              Use NAME for the job name, instead of deriving it from the name of the input file.

       --kpathsea-debug=BITMASK
              Sets path searching debugging flags according to the BITMASK.  See the Kpathsea manual for details.

       --mktex=FMT
              Enable mktexFMT generation, where FMT must be either tex or tfm.

       --nosocket
              Disable the luasocket (network) library.


       --output-comment=STRING
              In  DVI  mode, use STRING for the DVI file comment instead of the date.  This option is ignored
              inPDF mode.

       --output-directory=DIRECTORY
              Write output files in DIRECTORY instead of the current  directory.   Look  up  input  files  in
              DIRECTORY first, then along the normal search path.

       --output-format=FORMAT
              Set  the  output format mode, where FORMAT must be either pdf or dvi.  This also influences the
              set of graphics formats understood by luaTeX.

       --progname=NAME
              Pretend to be program NAME (only for kpathsea).

       --recorder
              Enable the filename recorder.  This leaves a trace of the files opened for input and output  in
              a file with extension .fls.

       --safer
              Disable some Lua commands that can easily be abused by a malicious document.

       --synctex=NUMBER
              Enable/disable SyncTeX extension.

       --version
              Print version information and exit.

       --credits
              Print credits and version details.

       The following options are ignored:

       --8bit, --etex, --parse-first-line,"--no-parse-first-line"
              These are always on.

       --default-translate-file=TCXNAME, --translate-file=
              TCXNAME These are always off.

       The  primary authors of LuaTeX are Hartmut Henkel, Taco Hoekwater, and Hans Hagen, with help from Mar‐
       tin Schröder, Karel Skoupy, and Han The Thanh.

       TeX was designed by Donald E. Knuth, who implemented it using his Web system for Pascal programs.   It
       was  ported  to  Unix  at Stanford by Howard Trickey, and at Cornell by Pavel Curtis.  The version now
       offered with the Unix TeX distribution is that generated by the Web to C  system  (web2c),  originally
       written by Tomas Rokicki and Tim Morgan.
