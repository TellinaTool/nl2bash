Name
       mattrib - change MSDOS file attribute flags



Note of warning
       This  manpage  has  been automatically generated from mtools's texinfo documentation, and may not be entirely
       accurate or complete.  See the end of this man page for details.

Description
       Mattrib is used to change MS-DOS file attribute flags. It has the following syntax:

       mattrib [-a|+a] [-h|+h] [-r|+r] [-s|+s] [-/]  [-p] [-X] msdosfile [ msdosfiles ... ]

       Mattrib adds attribute flags to an MS-DOS file (with the `+' operator) or remove attribute  flags  (with  the
       `-' operator).

       Mattrib supports the following attribute bits:

       a      Archive bit.  Used by some backup programs to indicate a new file.

       r      Read-only  bit.   Used  to indicate a read-only file.  Files with this bit set cannot be erased by DEL
              nor modified.

       s      System bit.  Used by MS-DOS to indicate a operating system file.

       h      Hidden bit.  Used to make files hidden from DIR.

       Mattrib supports the following command line flags:

       /      Recursive.  Recursively list the attributes of the files in the subdirectories.

       X      Concise. Prints the attributes without any whitespace padding.  If neither the "/"  option  is  given,
              nor  the  msdosfile  contains  a  wildcard, and there is only one MS-DOS file parameter on the command
              line, only the attribute is printed, and not the filename.  This option is convenient for scripts

       p      Replay mode.  Outputs a series of mformat commands that will reproduce the current situation, starting
              from  a situation as left by untarring the MS-DOS file system.  Commands are only output for attribute
              settings that differ from the default (archive bit set for files, unset for directories).  This option
              is  intended  to  be used in addition to tar. The readonly attribute is not taken into account, as tar
              can set that one itself.

Viewing the texi doc
       This manpage has been automatically generated from mtools's texinfo documentation. However, this  process  is
       only  approximative, and some items, such as crossreferences, footnotes and indices are lost in this transla‐
       tion process.  Indeed, these items have no appropriate representation in the manpage format.   Moreover,  not
       all information has been translated into the manpage version.  Thus I strongly advise you to use the original
       texinfo doc.  See the end of this manpage for instructions how to view the texinfo doc.

       *      To generate a printable copy from the texinfo doc, run the following commands:

                     ./configure; make dvi; dvips mtools.dvi



       *      To generate a html copy,  run:

                     ./configure; make html

       A premade html can be found at `http://www.gnu.org/software/mtools/manual/mtools.html'

       *      To generate an info copy (browsable using emacs' info mode), run:

                     ./configure; make info



       The texinfo doc looks most pretty when printed or as html.  Indeed, in the info version certain examples  are
       difficult to read due to the quoting conventions used in info.
