NAME
       peekfd - peek at file descriptors of running processes

SYNOPSIS
       peekfd   [-8,--eight-bit-clean]   [-n,--no-headers]  [-f,--follow]  [-d,--duplicates-removed]  [-V,--version]
       [-h,--help] pid [fd] [fd] ...

DESCRIPTION
       peekfd attaches to a running process and intercepts all reads and writes to file descriptors.  You can  spec‐
       ify the desired file descriptor numbers or dump all of them.

OPTIONS
       -8     Do no post-processing on the bytes being read or written.

       -n     Do not display headers indicating the source of the bytes dumped.

       -c     Also dump the requested file descriptor activity in any new child processes that are created.

       -d     Remove  duplicate  read/writes  from the output.  If you're looking at a tty with echo, you might want
              this.

       -v     Display a version string.

       -h     Display a help message.

FILES
       /proc/*/fd
              Not used but useful for the user to look at to get good file descriptor numbers.

ENVIRONMENT
       None.

DIAGNOSTICS
       The following diagnostics may be issued on stderr:

       Error attaching to pid ...
              An unknown error occurred while attempted to attach to a process..  you may need to be root.

BUGS
       Probably lots.  Don't be surprised if the process you are monitoring dies.
