DH_INSTALLWM(1)                                       Debhelper                                      DH_INSTALLWM(1)



NAME
       dh_installwm - register a window manager

SYNOPSIS
       dh_installwm [debhelper options] [-n] [--priority=n] [wm ...]

DESCRIPTION
       dh_installwm is a debhelper program that is responsible for generating the postinst and prerm commands that
       register a window manager with update-alternatives(8). The window manager's man page is also registered as a
       slave symlink (in v6 mode and up), if it is found in usr/share/man/man1/ in the package build directory.

FILES
       debian/package.wm
           List window manager programs to register.

OPTIONS
       --priority=n
           Set the priority of the window manager. Default is 20, which is too low for most window managers; see the
           Debian Policy document for instructions on calculating the correct value.

       -n, --noscripts
           Do not modify postinst/prerm scripts. Turns this command into a no-op.

       wm ...
           Window manager programs to register.

NOTES
       Note that this command is not idempotent. dh_prep(1) should be called between invocations of this command.
       Otherwise, it may cause multiple instances of the same text to be added to maintainer scripts.

SEE ALSO
       debhelper(7)

       This program is a part of debhelper.
