MPOST(1)                                       General Commands Manual                                      MPOST(1)



NAME
       mpost - MetaPost, a system for creating graphics

SYNOPSIS
       mpost [options] [commands]

       mpost --dvitomp dvifile[.dvi] [mpxfile[.mpx]]


DESCRIPTION
       MetaPost  interprets  the  MetaPost  language and produces PostScript (EPS) or Scalable Vector Graphics (SVG)
       pictures.  The MetaPost language is similar to Knuth's Metafont with additional features for including tex(1)
       or troff(1) commands and accessing features of PostScript not found in Metafont.

       MetaPost  is normally used with some preloaded macros, and it will use its executable name as the name of the
       preload file to use.   For example, when called as mpost the mpost.mp file is used,  which  is  identical  to
       plain.mp.  When the --ini option is given, preloading does not happen.

       The  commands  given  on  the  command line to the MetaPost program are passed to it as the first input line.
       (But it is often easier to type extended arguments as the first input line, since UNIX shells tend to  gobble
       up  or misinterpret MetaPost's favorite symbols, like semicolons, unless you quote them.) The normal usage is
       to say mpost figs to process the file figs.mp.  The basename of figs becomes the ``jobname'', and is used  in
       forming  output file names.  If no file is named, the jobname becomes mpout.  The default extension, .mp, can
       be overridden by specifying an extension explicitly.

       When the --dvitomp option is given, MetaPost acts as DVI-to-MPX converter only.  See dvitomp (1) for details.

       This manual page is not meant to be exhaustive.  The complete documentation for this version of MetaPost  can
       be found in the User Manual that should have been installed along with the program and is also available from
       http://tug.org/metapost.  See the FILES section below.

       The MetaPost language is similar to Metafont, but the manual assumes no knowledge of Metafont.  MetaPost does
       not have bitmap output commands or Metafont's online display mechanism.

AUTHORS
       MetaPost was designed by John D. Hobby, incorporating algorithms from Metafont by Donald E.  Knuth.   It  was
       originally  implemented  on Unix, incorporating system-dependent routines from web2c, while not relying on it
       except for the actual Web-to-C translator.

       Ulrik Vieth adapted MetaPost to take advantage of the advanced path searching features in  more  recent  ver‐
       sions of web2c and worked towards fully integrating MetaPost into the canonical Unix TeX distribution.

       The current, CWEB based version of MetaPost is maintained by Taco Hoekwater.

       The manual and tutorial are maintained by Stephan Hennig and Troy Henderson.
