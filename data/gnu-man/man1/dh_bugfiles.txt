NAME
       dh_bugfiles - install bug reporting customization files into package build directories

SYNOPSIS
       dh_bugfiles [-A] [debhelper options]

DESCRIPTION
       dh_bugfiles is a debhelper program that is responsible for installing bug reporting customization files (bug
       scripts and/or bug control files and/or presubj files) into package build directories.

FILES
       debian/package.bug-script
           This is the script to be run by the bug reporting program for generating a bug report template. This file
           is installed as usr/share/bug/package in the package build directory if no other types of bug reporting
           customization files are going to be installed for the package in question. Otherwise, this file is
           installed as usr/share/bug/package/script. Finally, the installed script is given execute permissions.

       debian/package.bug-control
           It is the bug control file containing some directions for the bug reporting tool. This file is installed
           as usr/share/bug/package/control in the package build directory.

       debian/package.bug-presubj
           The contents of this file are displayed to the user by the bug reporting tool before allowing the user to
           write a bug report on the package to the Debian Bug Tracking System. This file is installed as
           usr/share/bug/package/presubj in the package build directory.

OPTIONS
       -A, --all
           Install debian/bug-* files to ALL packages acted on when respective debian/package.bug-* files do not
           exist. Normally, debian/bug-* will be installed to the first package only.
