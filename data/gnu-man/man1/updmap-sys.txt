NAME
       updmap - manage TeX font maps, per-user
       updmap-sys - manage TeX font maps, system-wide

SYNOPSIS
       updmap [OPTION] ... [COMMAND]
       updmap-sys [OPTION] ... [COMMAND]

DESCRIPTION
       updmap (TeX Live, multi) version $Id: updmap.pl 31440 2013-08-15 22:39:10Z karl $

       Update  the default font map files used by pdftex, dvips, and dvipdfm(x), and optionally pxdvi, as determined
       by all configuration files updmap.cfg (the ones returned by running "kpsewhich  --all  updmap.cfg",  but  see
       below).

       Among  other things, these map files are used to determine which fonts should be used as bitmaps and which as
       outlines, and to determine which font files are included in the PDF or PostScript output.

       updmap-sys is intended to affect the system-wide configuration, while updmap affects  personal  configuration
       files  only,  overriding  the  system files.  As a consequence, once updmap has been run, even a single time,
       running updmap-sys no longer has any effect.  (updmap-sys issues a warning in this situation.)

       By default, the TeX filename database (ls-R) is also updated.

OPTIONS
       --cnffile FILE
              read FILE for the updmap configuration (can be given multiple times, in which case all the  files  are
              used)

       --dvipdfmxoutputdir DIR
              specify output directory (dvipdfm(x) syntax)

       --dvipsoutputdir DIR
              specify output directory (dvips syntax)

       --pdftexoutputdir DIR
              specify output directory (pdftex syntax)

       --pxdvioutputdir DIR
              specify output directory (pxdvi syntax)

       --outputdir DIR
              specify output directory (for all files)

       --copy cp generic files rather than using symlinks

       --force
              recreate files even if config hasn't changed

       --nomkmap
              do not recreate map files

       --nohash
              do not run texhash

       --sys  affect system-wide files (equivalent to updmap-sys)

       -n, --dry-run
              only show the configuration, no output

       --quiet, --silent
              reduce verbosity

   Commands:
       --help show this message and exit

       --version
              show version information and exit

       --showoption OPTION
              show the current setting of OPTION

       --showoptions OPTION
              show possible settings for OPTION

       --setoption OPTION VALUE
              set OPTION to value; option names below

       --setoption OPTION=VALUE
              as above, just different syntax

       --enable MAPTYPE MAPFILE
              add "MAPTYPE MAPFILE" to updmap.cfg, where MAPTYPE is Map, MixedMap, or KanjiMap

       --enable Map=MAPFILE
              add "Map MAPFILE" to updmap.cfg

       --enable MixedMap=MAPFILE add "MixedMap MAPFILE" to updmap.cfg

       --enable KanjiMap=MAPFILE add "KanjiMap MAPFILE" to updmap.cfg

       --disable MAPFILE
              disable MAPFILE, of whatever type

       --listmaps
              list all active and inactive maps

       --listavailablemaps
              same as --listmaps, but without unavailable map files

       --syncwithtrees
              disable unavailable map files in updmap.cfg

       Explanation of the map types: the (only) difference between Map and MixedMap is that MixedMap entries are not
       added to psfonts_pk.map.  The purpose is to help users with devices that render Type 1  outline  fonts  worse
       than  mode-tuned  Type  1 bitmap fonts.  So, MixedMap is used for fonts that are available as both Type 1 and
       Metafont.  KanjiMap entries are added to psfonts_t1.map and kanjix.map.

       Explanation of the OPTION names for --showoptions, --showoption, --setoption:

       dvipsPreferOutline
              true,false  (default true)

              Whether dvips uses bitmaps or outlines, when both are available.

       dvipsDownloadBase35
              true,false  (default true)

              Whether dvips includes the standard 35 PostScript fonts in its output.

       pdftexDownloadBase14
              true,false   (default true)

              Whether pdftex includes the standard 14 PDF fonts in its output.

       pxdviUse
              true,false  (default false)

              Whether maps for pxdvi (Japanese-patched xdvi) are under updmap's control.

       kanjiEmbed
              (any string)

       kanjiVariant
              (any string)

              See below.

       LW35   URWkb,URW,ADOBEkb,ADOBE  (default URWkb)

              Adapt the font and file names of the standard 35 PostScript fonts.

       URWkb  URW fonts with "berry" filenames    (e.g. uhvbo8ac.pfb)

       URW    URW fonts with "vendor" filenames   (e.g. n019064l.pfb)

       ADOBEkb
              Adobe fonts with "berry" filenames  (e.g. phvbo8an.pfb)

       ADOBE  Adobe fonts with "vendor" filenames (e.g. hvnbo___.pfb)

              These options are only read and acted on by updmap; dvips, pdftex, etc., do not  know  anything  about
              them.   They  work by changing the default map file which the programs read, so they can be overridden
              by specifying command-line options or configuration files to the programs, as explained at the  begin‐
              ning of updmap.cfg.

              The  options kanjiEmbed and kanjiVariant specify special replacements in the map lines.  If a map con‐
              tains the string @kanjiEmbed@, then this will be replaced by the value of that option;  similarly  for
              kanjiVariant.   In  this  way,  users of Japanese TeX can select different fonts to be included in the
              final output.

ENVIRONMENT
       Explanation of trees and files normally used:

              If --cnffile is specified on the command line (possibly multiple times), its value(s) are used.   Oth‐
              erwise,  updmap  reads  all  the updmap.cfg files found by running `kpsewhich -all updmap.cfg', in the
              order returned by kpsewhich.

              In any case, if multiple updmap.cfg files are found, all the maps  mentioned  in  all  the  updmap.cfg
              files are merged.

              Thus, if updmap.cfg files are present in all trees, and the default layout is used as shipped with TeX
              Live on Debian, the following files are read, in the given order.

              For updmap-sys:
              TEXMFSYSCONFIG /etc/texmf/web2c/updmap.cfg
              TEXMFSYSVAR    /var/lib/texmf/web2c/updmap.cfg
              TEXMFLOCAL     /usr/local/share/texmf/web2c/updmap.cfg
              TEXMFDEBIAN    /usr/share/texmf/web2c/updmap.cfg
              TEXMFDIST      /usr/share/texlive/texmf-dist/web2c/updmap.cfg

              For updmap:
              TEXMFCONFIG    $HOME/.texmf-config/web2c/updmap.cfg
              TEXMFVAR       $HOME/.texmf-var/web2c/updmap.cfg
              TEXMFHOME      $HOME/texmf/web2c/updmap.cfg
              TEXMFSYSCONFIG /etc/texmf/web2c/updmap.cfg
              TEXMFSYSVAR    /var/lib/texmf/web2c/updmap.cfg
              TEXMFLOCAL     /usr/local/share/texmf/web2c/updmap.cfg
              TEXMFDEBIAN    /usr/share/texmf/web2c/updmap.cfg
              TEXMFDIST      /usr/share/texlive/texmf-dist/web2c/updmap.cfg

              There is one exception to keep upgradability from earlier versions of TeX Live:  if  a  file  TEXMFLO‐
              CAL/web2c/updmap-local.cfg  exists  (formerly used by tlmgr to merge local fonts), then the file TEXM‐
              FLOCAL/web2c/updmap.cfg is ignored (if it exists) and that updmap-local.cfg is used instead.  In  this
              case,  updmap  recognizes the previous syntax for disabling map files in updmap-local.cfg (this syntax
              is different from what is used now).

              According to the actions, updmap might write to one of the given files or  create  a  new  updmap.cfg,
              described further below.

              Where  changes are saved: if config files are given on the command line, then the first one given will
              be used to save any changes from --setoption, --enable or --disable.  If the config  files  are  taken
              from kpsewhich output, then the algorithm is more complex:

              1)  If $TEXMFCONFIG/web2c/updmap.cfg or $TEXMFHOME/web2c/updmap.cfg appears in the list of used files,
              then the one listed first by kpsewhich --all (equivalently, the one returned by kpsewhich updmap.cfg),
              is used.

              2)  If  neither  of  the  above  two are present and changes are made, a new config file is created in
              $TEXMFCONFIG/web2c/updmap.cfg.

              Resolving multiple definitions of a font:

              If a font is defined in more than one map file, then  the  definition  coming  from  the  first-listed
              updmap.cfg is used.  If a font is defined multiple times within the same map file, one is chosen arbi‐
              trarily.  In both cases a warning is issued.

              Disabling maps:

              updmap.cfg files with higher priority (listed earlier) can disable maps mentioned  in  lower  priority
              (listed later) updmap.cfg files by writing, e.g.,

              #! Map mapname.map

              or

              #! MixedMap mapname.map

              in the higher-priority updmap.cfg file.

              As  an  example, suppose you have a copy of MathTime Pro fonts and want to disable the Belleek version
              of  the  fonts;  that  is,  disable  the  map  belleek.map.   You  can  create  the  file   $TEXMFCON‐
              FIG/web2c/updmap.cfg with the content

              #! Map belleek.map Map mt-plus.map Map mt-yy.map

              and call updmap.

              updmap  writes  the  map  files  for  dvips  (psfonts.map)  and  pdftex  (pdftex.map)  to  the  TEXMF‐
              VAR/fonts/map/updmap/{dvips,pdftex}/ directories.

              The log file is written to TEXMFVAR/web2c/updmap.log.

              When updmap-sys is run, TEXMFSYSCONFIG and TEXMFSYSVAR are used instead of TEXMFCONFIG  and  TEXMFVAR,
              respectively.  This is the only difference between updmap-sys and updmap.

              Other  locations  may be used if you give them on the command line, or these trees don't exist, or you
              are not using the original TeX Live.

              To see the precise locations of the various files that will be read and written, give  the  -n  option
              (or read the source).

       For even more terse instructions, read the beginning of the main updmap.cfg.

FILES
       Configuration and input files:

       updmap.cfg
              Main configuration file.  In texmf-dist/web2c by default, but may be located  elsewhere  depending  on
              your distribution.  Each texmf tree read should have its own updmap.cfg.

       dvips35.map
              Map file for standard 35 PostScript fonts for use with dvips(1).

       pdftex35.map
              Map file for standard 35 PostScript fonts for use with pdftex(1).

       ps2pk35.map
              Map file for standard 35 PostScript fonts for use with ps2pk(1).

       Output files:

       psfonts.map
              For dvips(1).  Same as psfonts_t1.map if option dvipsPreferOutline active, else as psfonts_pk.map.

       psfonts_pk.map
              For dvips(1).  Without information from MixedMap files.  (Setting of dvipsPreferOutline ignored.)

       psfonts_t1.map
              For dvips(1).  With information from MixedMap files.  (Setting of dvipsPreferOutline ignored.)

       download35.map
              For dvips(1).  Always downloads the standard 35 fonts.  (Setting of dvipsDownloadBase35 ignored.)

       builtin35.map
              For dvips(1).  Never downloads the standard 35 fonts.  (Setting of dvipsDownloadBase35 ignored.)

       pdftex.map
              For  pdftex(1).   Same  as  pdftex_dl14.map  if  option  pdftexDownloadBase14  active,  else  as  pdf‐
              tex_ndl14.map.

       pdftex_dl14.map
              For pdftex(1).  Always downloads the standard 14 fonts.

       pdftex_ndl14.map
              For pdftex(1).  Never downloads the standard 14 fonts.

       ps2pk.map
              Similar to psfonts.map file, but forces all fonts to be downloaded, so this map file can be used  with
              xdvi(1) and ps2pk(1).

       Configuration files for dvips(1):

       config.builtin35
              Loads builtin35.map instead of psfonts.map.

       config.download35
              Loads download35.map instead of psfonts.map.

       config.outline
              Loads psfonts_t1.map instead of psfonts.map.

       config.pdf
              Loads psfonts_t1.map instead of psfonts.map and has additional optimizations for PDF generation.

       config.pk
              Loads psfonts_pk.map instead of psfonts.map.

       config.www
              Loads psfonts_t1.map instead of psfonts.map.  (For compatibility with old versions.)

       config.gstopk
              Loads psfonts_t1.map instead of psfonts.map.
