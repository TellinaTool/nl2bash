NAME
       yuvtoppm - convert Abekas YUV bytes into a portable pixmap

SYNOPSIS
       yuvtoppm width height [imagedata]

DESCRIPTION
       Reads  raw  Abekas  YUV  bytes  as  input.  Produces a portable pixmap as output.  The input file is just YUV
       bytes.  You have to specify the width and height on the command line, since the program obviously  can't  get
       them from the file.  The maxval is assumed to be 255.
