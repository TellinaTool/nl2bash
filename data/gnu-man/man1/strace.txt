DESCRIPTION
       In  the simplest case strace runs the specified command until it exits.  It intercepts and records the system
       calls which are called by a process and the signals which are received by a process.  The name of each system
       call,  its  arguments and its return value are printed on standard error or to the file specified with the -o
       option.

       strace is a useful diagnostic, instructional, and debugging tool.  System administrators, diagnosticians  and
       trouble-shooters will find it invaluable for solving problems with programs for which the source is not read‐
       ily available since they do not need to be recompiled in order to trace  them.   Students,  hackers  and  the
       overly-curious will find that a great deal can be learned about a system and its system calls by tracing even
       ordinary programs.  And programmers will find that since system calls and signals are events that  happen  at
       the  user/kernel  interface,  a  close  examination of this boundary is very useful for bug isolation, sanity
       checking and attempting to capture race conditions.

       Each line in the trace contains the system call name, followed by its arguments in parentheses and its return
       value.  An example from stracing the command ``cat /dev/null'' is:

       open("/dev/null", O_RDONLY) = 3

       Errors (typically a return value of -1) have the errno symbol and error string appended.

       open("/foo/bar", O_RDONLY) = -1 ENOENT (No such file or directory)

       Signals  are  printed  as a signal symbol and a signal string.  An excerpt from stracing and interrupting the
       command ``sleep 666'' is:

       sigsuspend([] <unfinished ...>
       --- SIGINT (Interrupt) ---
       +++ killed by SIGINT +++

       If a system call is being executed and meanwhile another one is being called from a different  thread/process
       then  strace  will  try  to preserve the order of those events and mark the ongoing call as being unfinished.
       When the call returns it will be marked as resumed.

       [pid 28772] select(4, [3], NULL, NULL, NULL <unfinished ...>
       [pid 28779] clock_gettime(CLOCK_REALTIME, {1130322148, 939977000}) = 0
       [pid 28772] <... select resumed> )      = 1 (in [3])

       Interruption of a (restartable) system call by a signal delivery is processed differently  as  kernel  termi‐
       nates the system call and also arranges its immediate reexecution after the signal handler completes.

       read(0, 0x7ffff72cf5cf, 1)              = ? ERESTARTSYS (To be restarted)
       --- SIGALRM (Alarm clock) @ 0 (0) ---
       rt_sigreturn(0xe)                       = 0
       read(0, ""..., 1)                       = 0

       Arguments  are  printed in symbolic form with a passion.  This example shows the shell performing ``>>xyzzy''
       output redirection:

       open("xyzzy", O_WRONLY|O_APPEND|O_CREAT, 0666) = 3

       Here the third argument of open is decoded by breaking down the flag argument into its three bitwise-OR  con‐
       stituents  and printing the mode value in octal by tradition.  Where traditional or native usage differs from
       ANSI or POSIX, the latter forms are preferred.  In some cases, strace output has proven to be  more  readable
       than the source.

       Structure pointers are dereferenced and the members are displayed as appropriate.  In all cases arguments are
       formatted in the most C-like fashion possible.  For example, the essence of the command ``ls  -l  /dev/null''
       is captured as:

       lstat("/dev/null", {st_mode=S_IFCHR|0666, st_rdev=makedev(1, 3), ...}) = 0

       Notice how the `struct stat' argument is dereferenced and how each member is displayed symbolically.  In par‐
       ticular, observe how the st_mode member is carefully decoded into a bitwise-OR of symbolic and  numeric  val‐
       ues.   Also  notice  in  this example that the first argument to lstat is an input to the system call and the
       second argument is an output.  Since output arguments are not modified if the system  call  fails,  arguments
       may  not  always  be dereferenced.  For example, retrying the ``ls -l'' example with a non-existent file pro‐
       duces the following line:

       lstat("/foo/bar", 0xb004) = -1 ENOENT (No such file or directory)

       In this case the porch light is on but nobody is home.

       Character pointers are dereferenced and printed as C strings.  Non-printing characters in  strings  are  nor‐
       mally  represented  by  ordinary C escape codes.  Only the first strsize (32 by default) bytes of strings are
       printed; longer strings have an ellipsis appended following the closing quote.  Here is a line from ``ls -l''
       where the getpwuid library routine is reading the password file:

       read(3, "root::0:0:System Administrator:/"..., 1024) = 422

       While structures are annotated using curly braces, simple pointers and arrays are printed using square brack‐
       ets with commas separating elements.  Here is an example from the command ``id'' on a system with  supplemen‐
       tary group ids:

       getgroups(32, [100, 0]) = 2

       On  the  other  hand,  bit-sets are also shown using square brackets but set elements are separated only by a
       space.  Here is the shell preparing to execute an external command:

       sigprocmask(SIG_BLOCK, [CHLD TTOU], []) = 0

       Here the second argument is a bit-set of two signals, SIGCHLD and SIGTTOU.  In some cases the bit-set  is  so
       full that printing out the unset elements is more valuable.  In that case, the bit-set is prefixed by a tilde
       like this:

       sigprocmask(SIG_UNBLOCK, ~[], NULL) = 0

       Here the second argument represents the full set of all signals.

OPTIONS
       -c          Count time, calls, and errors for each system call and report a summary on  program  exit.
                   On  Linux,  this attempts to show system time (CPU time spent running in the kernel) inde‐
                   pendent of wall clock time.  If -c is used with -f or -F (below),  only  aggregate  totals
                   for all traced processes are kept.

       -C          Like -c but also print regular output while processes are running.

       -D          Run  tracer  process  as a detached grandchild, not as parent of the tracee.  This reduces
                   the visible effect of strace by keeping the tracee a direct child of the calling process.

       -d          Show some debugging output of strace itself on the standard error.

       -f          Trace child processes as they are created by currently traced processes as a result of the
                   fork(2),  vfork(2)  and clone(2) system calls. Note that -p PID -f will attach all threads
                   of process PID if it is multi-threaded, not only thread with thread_id = PID.

       -ff         If the -o filename option is in effect, each processes trace is  written  to  filename.pid
                   where  pid is the numeric process id of each process.  This is incompatible with -c, since
                   no per-process counts are kept.

       -F          This option is now obsolete and it has the same functionality as -f.

       -h          Print the help summary.

       -i          Print the instruction pointer at the time of the system call.

       -q          Suppress messages about attaching, detaching etc.  This happens automatically when  output
                   is redirected to a file and the command is run directly instead of attaching.

       -qq         If given twice, suppress messages about process exit status.

       -r          Print  a relative timestamp upon entry to each system call.  This records the time differ‐
                   ence between the beginning of successive system calls.

       -t          Prefix each line of the trace with the time of day.

       -tt         If given twice, the time printed will include the microseconds.

       -ttt        If given thrice, the time printed will include the microseconds and  the  leading  portion
                   will be printed as the number of seconds since the epoch.

       -T          Show  the  time spent in system calls. This records the time difference between the begin‐
                   ning and the end of each system call.

       -v          Print unabbreviated versions of environment, stat, termios, etc.  calls.  These structures
                   are  very  common  in  calls  and  so the default behavior displays a reasonable subset of
                   structure members.  Use this option to get all of the gory details.

       -V          Print the version number of strace.

       -x          Print all non-ASCII strings in hexadecimal string format.

       -xx         Print all strings in hexadecimal string format.

       -y          Print paths associated with file descriptor arguments.

       -a column   Align return values in a specific column (default column 40).

       -b syscall  If specified syscall is reached, detach  from  traced  process.   Currently,  only  execve
                   syscall  is  supported.  This option is useful if you want to trace multi-threaded process
                   and therefore require -f, but don't want to trace its (potentially very complex) children.

       -e expr     A qualifying expression which modifies which events to trace or how to  trace  them.   The
                   format of the expression is:

                             [qualifier=][!]value1[,value2]...

                   where qualifier is one of trace, abbrev, verbose, raw, signal, read, or write and value is
                   a qualifier-dependent symbol or number.  The default qualifier is trace.  Using an  excla‐
                   mation mark negates the set of values.  For example, -e open means literally -e trace=open
                   which in turn means trace only the open system call.  By contrast, -e trace=!open means to
                   trace  every  system  call except open.  In addition, the special values all and none have
                   the obvious meanings.

                   Note that some shells use the exclamation point for history expansion even  inside  quoted
                   arguments.  If so, you must escape the exclamation point with a backslash.

       -e trace=set
                   Trace  only  the  specified  set of system calls.  The -c option is useful for determining
                   which system calls might be useful to  trace.   For  example,  trace=open,close,read,write
                   means  to only trace those four system calls.  Be careful when making inferences about the
                   user/kernel boundary if only a subset of system calls are being monitored.  The default is
                   trace=all.

       -e trace=file
                   Trace all system calls which take a file name as an argument.  You can think of this as an
                   abbreviation for -e trace=open,stat,chmod,unlink,...  which is useful to seeing what files
                   the  process  is  referencing.   Furthermore,  using the abbreviation will ensure that you
                   don't accidentally forget to include a call like lstat in the list.  Betchya woulda forgot
                   that one.

       -e trace=process
                   Trace  all system calls which involve process management.  This is useful for watching the
                   fork, wait, and exec steps of a process.

       -e trace=network
                   Trace all the network related system calls.

       -e trace=signal
                   Trace all signal related system calls.

       -e trace=ipc
                   Trace all IPC related system calls.

       -e trace=desc
                   Trace all file descriptor related system calls.

       -e trace=memory
                   Trace all memory mapping related system calls.

       -e abbrev=set
                   Abbreviate the output from printing each member  of  large  structures.   The  default  is
                   abbrev=all.  The -v option has the effect of abbrev=none.

       -e verbose=set
                   Dereference structures for the specified set of system calls.  The default is verbose=all.

       -e raw=set  Print raw, undecoded arguments for the specified set of system calls.  This option has the
                   effect of causing all arguments to be printed in hexadecimal.  This is  mostly  useful  if
                   you don't trust the decoding or you need to know the actual numeric value of an argument.

       -e signal=set
                   Trace only the specified subset of signals.  The default is signal=all.  For example, sig‐
                   nal =! SIGIO (or signal=!io) causes SIGIO signals not to be traced.

       -e read=set Perform a full hexadecimal and ASCII dump of all  the  data  read  from  file  descriptors
                   listed in the specified set.  For example, to see all input activity on file descriptors 3
                   and 5 use -e read=3,5.  Note that this is independent  from  the  normal  tracing  of  the
                   read(2) system call which is controlled by the option -e trace=read.

       -e write=set
                   Perform  a  full  hexadecimal  and  ASCII dump of all the data written to file descriptors
                   listed in the specified set.  For example, to see all output activity on file  descriptors
                   3  and  5  use -e write=3,5.  Note that this is independent from the normal tracing of the
                   write(2) system call which is controlled by the option -e trace=write.

       -I interruptible
                   When strace can be interrupted by signals (such  as  pressing  ^C).   1:  no  signals  are
                   blocked;  2:  fatal signals are blocked while decoding syscall (default); 3: fatal signals
                   are always blocked (default if '-o FILE PROG'); 4: fatal  signals  and  SIGTSTP  (^Z)  are
                   always blocked (useful to make strace -o FILE PROG not stop on ^Z).

       -o filename Write  the  trace  output to the file filename rather than to stderr.  Use filename.pid if
                   -ff is used.  If the argument begins with `|' or with `!' then the rest of the argument is
                   treated  as  a  command  and all output is piped to it.  This is convenient for piping the
                   debugging output to a program without affecting the redirections of executed programs.

       -O overhead Set the overhead for tracing system calls to overhead microseconds.  This  is  useful  for
                   overriding  the  default  heuristic  for guessing how much time is spent in mere measuring
                   when timing system calls using the -c option.  The accuracy of the heuristic can be gauged
                   by  timing  a  given program run without tracing (using time(1)) and comparing the accumu‐
                   lated system call time to the total produced using -c.

       -p pid      Attach to the process with the process ID pid and begin tracing.  The trace may be  termi‐
                   nated at any time by a keyboard interrupt signal (CTRL-C).  strace will respond by detach‐
                   ing itself from the traced process(es) leaving it (them) to continue running.  Multiple -p
                   options can be used to attach to many processes.  -p "`pidof PROG`" syntax is supported.

       -P path     Trace  only  system calls accessing path.  Multiple -P options can be used to specify sev‐
                   eral paths.

       -s strsize  Specify the maximum string size to print (the default is 32).  Note that filenames are not
                   considered strings and are always printed in full.

       -S sortby   Sort  the  output  of  the  histogram printed by the -c option by the specified criterion.
                   Legal values are time, calls, name, and nothing (default is time).

       -u username Run command with the user ID, group ID, and supplementary groups of username.  This option
                   is  only  useful  when  running as root and enables the correct execution of setuid and/or
                   setgid binaries.  Unless this option is used setuid and setgid programs are executed with‐
                   out effective privileges.

       -E var=val  Run command with var=val in its list of environment variables.

       -E var      Remove  var  from  the inherited list of environment variables before passing it on to the
                   command.

DIAGNOSTICS
       When command exits, strace exits with the same exit status.  If command is  terminated  by  a  signal,
       strace  terminates itself with the same signal, so that strace can be used as a wrapper process trans‐
       parent to the invoking parent process.

       When using -p, the exit status of strace is zero unless there was an unexpected  error  in  doing  the
       tracing.

SETUID INSTALLATION
       If  strace is installed setuid to root then the invoking user will be able to attach to and trace pro‐
       cesses owned by any user.  In addition setuid and setgid programs will be executed and traced with the
       correct effective privileges.  Since only users trusted with full root privileges should be allowed to
       do these things, it only makes sense to install strace as setuid to root when the users who  can  exe‐
       cute  it  are restricted to those users who have this trust.  For example, it makes sense to install a
       special version of strace with mode `rwsr-xr--', user root and group trace, where members of the trace
       group  are trusted users.  If you do use this feature, please remember to install a non-setuid version
       of strace for ordinary lusers to use.

NOTES
       It is a pity that so much tracing clutter is produced by systems employing shared libraries.

       It is instructive to think about system call inputs and outputs as data-flow  across  the  user/kernel
       boundary.   Because  user-space  and  kernel-space are separate and address-protected, it is sometimes
       possible to make deductive inferences about process behavior using inputs and outputs as propositions.

       In some cases, a system call will differ from the documented behavior or have a different  name.   For
       example,  on  System  V-derived systems the true time(2) system call does not take an argument and the
       stat function is called xstat and takes an extra leading argument.  These discrepancies are normal but
       idiosyncratic  characteristics of the system call interface and are accounted for by C library wrapper
       functions.

       On some platforms a process that has a system call trace applied to it with the -p option will receive
       a  SIGSTOP.  This signal may interrupt a system call that is not restartable.  This may have an unpre‐
       dictable effect on the process if the process takes no action to restart the system call.

BUGS
       Programs that use the setuid bit do not have effective user ID privileges while being traced.

       A traced process runs slowly.

       Traced processes which are descended from command may be left running after an interrupt signal (CTRL-
       C).

       The -i option is weakly supported.

HISTORY
       strace  The  original  strace  was  written by Paul Kranenburg for SunOS and was inspired by its trace
       utility.  The SunOS version of strace was ported to Linux and enhanced by Branko Lankester,  who  also
       wrote the Linux kernel support.  Even though Paul released strace 2.5 in 1992, Branko's work was based
       on Paul's strace 1.5 release from 1991.  In 1993, Rick Sladkey merged strace 2.5  for  SunOS  and  the
       second  release of strace for Linux, added many of the features of truss(1) from SVR4, and produced an
       strace that worked on both platforms.  In 1994 Rick ported strace to SVR4 and Solaris  and  wrote  the
       automatic  configuration support.  In 1995 he ported strace to Irix and tired of writing about himself
       in the third person.

PROBLEMS
       Problems with strace should be reported to the  strace  mailing  list  at  <strace-devel@lists.source‐
       forge.net>.
