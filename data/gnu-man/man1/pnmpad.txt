pnmpad(1)                                      General Commands Manual                                     pnmpad(1)



NAME
       pnmpad - add borders to portable anymap

SYNOPSIS
       pnmpad [-verbose] [-white|-black]
       [[[-width=width [-halign=ratio]] |
          [-left=leftpad] [-right=rightpad]]]
       [[[-height=height [-valign=ratio]] |
          [-top=toppad] [-bottom=botpad]]]
       [pnmfile]

       All  options  can  be abbreviated to their shortest unique prefix.  You may use two hyphens instead of one to
       designate an option.  You may use either white space or an equals sign between an option name and its value.


DESCRIPTION
       Reads a PNM image as input. Outputs a PNM image that is the input image plus black or white  borders  of  the
       sizes specified.

       If you just need to convert an image to a certain size regardless of the original dimensions, pnmcut with the
       -pad option may be a better choice.



OPTIONS
       -verbose
              Verbose output.

       -white
       -black (default)
              Set pad color.

       -left leftpad
       -right rightpad
       -top toppad
       -bottom bottompad
              Specify amount of padding in pixels.

       -width width
              Set desired width of image. Overrides -left and -right if specified. If width is less than the  actual
              image width, it is ignored. Use pnmcut(1) to cut off parts of images.

       -height height
              Set  desired  height  of  image.  Overrides  -top and -bottom if specified. If height is less than the
              actual image height, it is ignored. Use pnmcut(1) to cut off parts of images.

       -halign ratio
              A real number between 0 and 1. Used in conjunction with -width, sets the alignment ratio between  left
              padding and right padding.

              Useful values:

              0.0    - left aligned;

              0.5    - center aligned (default);

              1.0    - right aligned.

       -valign ratio
              A real number between 0 and 1. Used in conjunction with -height, sets the alignment ratio between bot‐
              tom padding and top padding.

              Useful values:

              0.0    - bottom aligned;

              0.5    - center aligned (default);

              1.0    - top aligned.


HISTORY
       Before February 2002,
              pnmpad had a different option syntax which was less expressive and not like conventional  Netpbm  pro‐
              grams.   That  syntax  is still understood by pnmpad for backward compatibility, but not documented or
              supported for future use.
