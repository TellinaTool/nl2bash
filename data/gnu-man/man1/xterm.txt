XTERM(1)                                           X Window System                                          XTERM(1)



NAME
       xterm - terminal emulator for X

SYNOPSIS
       xterm [-toolkitoption ...] [-option ...] [shell]

DESCRIPTION
       The  xterm  program is a terminal emulator for the X Window System.  It provides DEC VT102/VT220 and selected
       features from higher-level terminals such as VT320/VT420/VT520 (VTxxx).  It also provides Tektronix 4014 emu‐
       lation  for programs that cannot use the window system directly.  If the underlying operating system supports
       terminal resizing capabilities (for example, the SIGWINCH signal in systems derived from 4.3bsd), xterm  will
       use the facilities to notify programs running in the window whenever it is resized.

       The  VTxxx  and Tektronix 4014 terminals each have their own window so that you can edit text in one and look
       at graphics in the other at the same time.  To maintain the correct aspect  ratio  (height/width),  Tektronix
       graphics  will be restricted to the largest box with a 4014's aspect ratio that will fit in the window.  This
       box is located in the upper left area of the window.

       Although both windows may be displayed at the same time, one of them is considered the  “active”  window  for
       receiving  keyboard input and terminal output.  This is the window that contains the text cursor.  The active
       window can be chosen through escape sequences, the “VT Options” menu  in  the  VTxxx  window,  and  the  “Tek
       Options” menu in the 4014 window.

EMULATIONS
       The  VT102  emulation  is  fairly complete, but does not support autorepeat.  Double-size characters are dis‐
       played properly if your font server supports scalable fonts.  The  VT220  emulation  does  not  support  soft
       fonts,  it  is otherwise complete.  Termcap(5) entries that work with xterm include an optional platform-spe‐
       cific entry (“xterm”), “xterm”, “vt102”, “vt100”, “ansi” and “dumb”.  xterm automatically searches the  term‐
       cap  file  in  this order for these entries and then sets the “TERM” and the “TERMCAP” environment variables.
       You may also use “vt220”,  but must set the terminal emulation level with the decTerminalID  resource.   (The
       “TERMCAP”  environment variable is not set if xterm is linked against a terminfo library, since the requisite
       information is not provided by the termcap emulation of terminfo libraries).

       Many of the special xterm features may be modified under program control through a set  of  escape  sequences
       different from the standard VT102 escape sequences.  (See the Xterm Control Sequences document.)

       The Tektronix 4014 emulation is also fairly good.  It supports 12-bit graphics addressing, scaled to the win‐
       dow size.  Four different font sizes and five different lines types are supported.  There is no write-through
       or defocused mode support.  The Tektronix text and graphics commands are recorded internally by xterm and may
       be written to a file by sending the COPY escape sequence (or through the Tektronix  menu;  see  below).   The
       name  of  the  file will be “COPYyyyy-MM-dd.hh:mm:ss”, where yyyy, MM, dd, hh, mm and ss are the year, month,
       day, hour, minute and second when the COPY was performed (the file is  created  in  the  directory  xterm  is
       started in, or the home directory for a login xterm).

       Not  all  of  the features described in this manual are necessarily available in this version of xterm.  Some
       (e.g., the non-VT220 extensions) are available only if they were compiled in, though the  most  commonly-used
       are in the default configuration.

OTHER FEATURES
       Xterm automatically highlights the text cursor when the pointer enters the window (selected) and unhighlights
       it when the pointer leaves the window (unselected).  If the window is the focus window, then the text  cursor
       is highlighted no matter where the pointer is.

       In VT102 mode, there are escape sequences to activate and deactivate an alternate screen buffer, which is the
       same size as the display area of the window.  When activated, the current screen is saved and  replaced  with
       the alternate screen.  Saving of lines scrolled off the top of the window is disabled until the normal screen
       is restored.  The termcap(5) entry for xterm allows the visual editor vi(1) to switch to the alternate screen
       for editing and to restore the screen on exit.  A popup menu entry makes it simple to switch between the nor‐
       mal and alternate screens for cut and paste.

       In either VT102 or Tektronix mode, there are escape sequences to change the name of the  windows.   Addition‐
       ally, in VT102 mode, xterm implements the window-manipulation control sequences from dtterm, such as resizing
       the window, setting its location on the screen.

       Xterm allows character-based applications to receive mouse events (currently button-press and release events,
       and button-motion events) as keyboard control sequences.  See Xterm Control Sequences for details.

OPTIONS
       The  xterm terminal emulator accepts the standard X Toolkit command line options as well as many application-
       specific options.  If the option begins with a `+' instead of a `-', the option is restored  to  its  default
       value.   The -version and -help options are interpreted even if xterm cannot open the display, and are useful
       for testing and configuration scripts.  Along with -class, they are checked before other options.

       -version
               This causes xterm to print a version number to the standard output, and then exit.

       -help   This causes xterm to print out a verbose message describing its options, one per line.   The  message
               is  written  to  the standard output.  After printing the message, xterm exits.  Xterm generates this
               message, sorting it and noting whether a “-option” or a “+option” turns the feature on or off,  since
               some  features historically have been one or the other.  Xterm generates a concise help message (mul‐
               tiple options per line) when an unknown option is used, e.g.,

                   xterm -z

       If the logic for a particular option such as logging is not compiled into  xterm,  the  help  text  for  that
       option also is not displayed by the -help option.

       One  parameter  (after  all  options) may be given.  That overrides xterm's built-in choice of shell program.
       Normally xterm checks the SHELL variable.  If that is not set, xterm tries to use the shell program specified
       in  the  password  file.   If  that is not set, xterm uses /bin/sh.  If the parameter is not a relative path,
       i.e., beginning with “./” or “../”, xterm looks for the file in the user's PATH.  In  either  case,  it  con‐
       structs an absolute path.  The -e option cannot be used with this parameter since it uses all parameters fol‐
       lowing the option.

       The other options are used to control the appearance and behavior.  Not all options are  necessarily  config‐
       ured into your copy of xterm:

       -132    Normally,  the VT102 DECCOLM escape sequence that switches between 80 and 132 column mode is ignored.
               This option causes the DECCOLM escape sequence to be recognized, and the  xterm  window  will  resize
               appropriately.

       -ah     This  option  indicates  that  xterm should always highlight the text cursor.  By default, xterm will
               display a hollow text cursor whenever the focus is lost or the pointer leaves the window.

       +ah     This option indicates that xterm should do text cursor highlighting based on focus.

       -ai     This option disables active icon support if that feature was compiled into xterm.  This is equivalent
               to setting the vt100 resource activeIcon to “false”.

       +ai     This  option enables active icon support if that feature was compiled into xterm.  This is equivalent
               to setting the vt100 resource activeIcon to “true”.

       -aw     This option indicates that auto-wraparound should be allowed.  This allows the  cursor  to  automati‐
               cally  wrap to the beginning of the next line when it is at the rightmost position of a line and text
               is output.

       +aw     This option indicates that auto-wraparound should not be allowed.

       -b number
               This option specifies the size of the inner border (the distance between the outer edge of the  char‐
               acters  and the window border) in pixels.  That is the vt100 internalBorder resource.  The default is
               “2”.

       +bc     turn off text cursor blinking.  This overrides the cursorBlink resource.

       -bc     turn on text cursor blinking.  This overrides the cursorBlink resource.

       -bcf milliseconds
               set the amount of time text cursor is off when blinking via the cursorOffTime resource.

       -bcn milliseconds
               set the amount of time text cursor is on when blinking via the cursorOffTime resource.

       -bdc    Set the vt100 resource colorBDMode  to  “false”,  disabling  the  display  of  characters  with  bold
               attribute as color

       +bdc    Set  the vt100 resource colorBDMode to “true”, enabling the display of characters with bold attribute
               as color rather than bold

       -cb     Set the vt100 resource cutToBeginningOfLine to “false”.

       +cb     Set the vt100 resource cutToBeginningOfLine to “true”.

       -cc characterclassrange:value[,...]
               This sets classes indicated by the given ranges for using in selecting by  words.   See  the  section
               specifying character classes.  and discussion of the charClass resource.

       -cjk_width
               Set  the cjkWidth resource to “true”.  When turned on, characters with East Asian Ambiguous (A) cate‐
               gory in UTR 11 have a column width of 2.  Otherwise, they have a column width of 1.  This may be use‐
               ful  for some legacy CJK text terminal-based programs assuming box drawings and others to have a col‐
               umn width of 2.  It also should be turned on when  you  specify  a  TrueType  CJK  double-width  (bi-
               width/monospace)  font  either  with  -fa  at  the command line or faceName resource.  The default is
               “false”

       +cjk_width
               Reset the cjkWidth resource.

       -class string
               This option allows you to override xterm's resource class.  Normally it is “XTerm”, but can be set to
               another class such as “UXTerm” to override selected resources.

       -cm     This  option  disables  recognition  of  ANSI  color-change  escape sequences.  It sets the colorMode
               resource to “false”.

       +cm     This option enables recognition of ANSI color-change escape sequences.  This is the same as the vt100
               resource colorMode.

       -cn     This  option  indicates that newlines should not be cut in line-mode selections.  It sets the cutNew‐
               line resource to “false”.

       +cn     This option indicates that newlines should be cut in line-mode selections.  It  sets  the  cutNewline
               resource to “true”.

       -cr color
               This  option  specifies  the color to use for text cursor.  The default is to use the same foreground
               color that is used for text.  It sets the cursorColor resource according to the parameter.

       -cu     This option indicates that xterm should work around a bug in the more(1) program that  causes  it  to
               incorrectly  display lines that are exactly the width of the window and are followed by a line begin‐
               ning with a tab (the leading tabs are not displayed).  This option is so named because it was  origi‐
               nally thought to be a bug in the curses(3x) cursor motion package.

       +cu     This option indicates that xterm should not work around the more(1) bug mentioned above.

       -dc     This  option  disables  the  escape sequence to change dynamic colors: the vt100 foreground and back‐
               ground colors, its text cursor color, the pointer cursor foreground and background colors,  the  Tek‐
               tronix  emulator  foreground  and  background colors, its text cursor color and highlight color.  The
               option sets the dynamicColors option to “false”.

       +dc     This option enables the escape sequence to change dynamic colors.  The option sets the  dynamicColors
               option to “true”.

       -e program [ arguments ... ]
               This option specifies the program (and its command line arguments) to be run in the xterm window.  It
               also sets the window title and icon name to be the basename of the program being executed if  neither
               -T nor -n are given on the command line.  This must be the last option on the command line.

       -en encoding
               This  option  determines  the  encoding on which xterm runs.  It sets the locale resource.  Encodings
               other than UTF-8 are supported by using luit.  The -lc option should be used instead of -en for  sys‐
               tems with locale support.

       -fb font
               This option specifies a font to be used when displaying bold text.  It sets the boldFont resource.

               This font must be the same height and width as the normal font, otherwise it is ignored.  If only one
               of the normal or bold fonts is specified, it will be used as the normal font and the bold  font  will
               be produced by overstriking this font.

               See also the discussion of boldMode and alwaysBoldMode resources.

       -fa pattern
               This option sets the pattern for fonts selected from the FreeType library if support for that library
               was compiled into xterm.  This corresponds to the faceName resource.  When a CJK double-width font is
               specified, you also need to turn on the cjkWidth resource.

               See  also  the  renderFont resource, which combines with this to determine whether FreeType fonts are
               initially active.

       -fbb    This option indicates that xterm should compare normal and bold fonts bounding boxes to  ensure  they
               are compatible.  It sets the freeBoldBox resource to “false”.

       +fbb    This  option  indicates  that xterm should not compare normal and bold fonts bounding boxes to ensure
               they are compatible.  It sets the freeBoldBox resource to “true”.

       -fbx    This option indicates that xterm should not assume that the normal and bold fonts  have  VT100  line-
               drawing characters.  If any are missing, xterm will draw the characters directly.  It sets the force‐
               BoxChars resource to “false”.

       +fbx    This option indicates that xterm should assume that the normal and bold fonts have VT100 line-drawing
               characters.  It sets the forceBoxChars resource to “true”.

       -fd pattern
               This option sets the pattern for double-width fonts selected from the FreeType library if support for
               that library was compiled into xterm.  This corresponds to the faceNameDoublesize resource.

       -fi font
               This option sets the font for active icons if that feature was compiled into xterm.

               See also the discussion of the iconFont resource.

       -fs size
               This option sets the pointsize for fonts selected from the  FreeType  library  if  support  for  that
               library was compiled into xterm.  This corresponds to the faceSize resource.

       -fullscreen
               This option indicates that xterm should ask the window manager to let it use the full-screen for dis‐
               play, e.g., without window decorations.  It sets the fullscreen resource to “true”.

       +fullscreen
               This option indicates that xterm should not ask the window manager to let it use the full-screen  for
               display.  It sets the fullscreen resource to “false”.

       -fw font
               This  option  specifies the font to be used for displaying wide text.  By default, it will attempt to
               use a font twice as wide as the font that will be used to draw normal text.  If no double-width  font
               is  found,  it  will  improvise,  by  stretching  the  normal font.  This corresponds to the wideFont
               resource.

       -fwb font
               This option specifies the font to be used for displaying bold wide text.  By default, it will attempt
               to use a font twice as wide as the font that will be used to draw bold text.  If no double-width font
               is found, it will improvise, by stretching the bold  font.   This  corresponds  to  the  wideBoldFont
               resource.

       -fx font
               This  option  specifies  the  font  to be used for displaying the preedit string in the “OverTheSpot”
               input method.

               See also the discussion of the ximFont resource.

       -hc color
               (see -selbg).

       -hf     This option indicates that HP Function Key escape codes should be generated for  function  keys.   It
               sets the hpFunctionKeys resource to “true”.

       +hf     This  option  indicates  that HP Function Key escape codes should not be generated for function keys.
               It sets the hpFunctionKeys resource to “false”.

       -hm     Tells xterm to use highlightTextColor and highlightColor to override  the  reversed  foreground/back‐
               ground colors in a selection.  It sets the highlightColorMode resource to “true”.

       +hm     Tells  xterm  not  to  use  highlightTextColor  and  highlightColor  to  override  the reversed fore‐
               ground/background colors in a selection.  It sets the highlightColorMode resource to “false”.

       -hold   Turn on the hold resource, i.e., xterm will not immediately destroy its window when the shell command
               completes.   It  will wait until you use the window manager to destroy/kill the window, or if you use
               the menu entries that send a signal, e.g., HUP or KILL.

       +hold   Turn off the hold resource, i.e., xterm will immediately destroy its window when  the  shell  command
               completes.

       -ie     Turn on the ptyInitialErase resource, i.e., use the pseudo-terminal's sense of the stty erase value.

       +ie     Turn  off  the  ptyInitialErase resource, i.e., set the stty erase value using the kb string from the
               termcap entry as a reference, if available.

       -im     Turn on the useInsertMode resource, which forces use of insert mode by adding appropriate entries  to
               the TERMCAP environment variable.

       +im     Turn off the useInsertMode resource.

       -into windowId
               Given  an  X  window  identifier (an integer, which can be hexadecimal, octal or decimal according to
               whether it begins with "0x", "0" or neither), xterm will reparent its top-level shell widget to  that
               window.  This is used to embed xterm within other applications.

               For  instance,  there  are  scripts  for Tcl/Tk and Gtk which can be used to demonstrate the feature.
               When using Gtk, there is a limitation of that toolkit which  requires  that  xterm's  allowSendEvents
               resource is enabled.

       -j      This  option  indicates  that  xterm  should  do  jump  scrolling.   It corresponds to the jumpScroll
               resource.  Normally, text is scrolled one line at a time; this option allows xterm to  move  multiple
               lines  at  a  time  so that it does not fall as far behind.  Its use is strongly recommended since it
               makes xterm much faster when scanning through large amounts of text.  The VT100 escape sequences  for
               enabling  and  disabling smooth scroll as well as the “VT Options” menu can be used to turn this fea‐
               ture on or off.

       +j      This option indicates that xterm should not do jump scrolling.

       -k8     This option sets the allowC1Printable resource.  When allowC1Printable is set,  xterm  overrides  the
               mapping of C1 control characters (code 128-159) to treat them as printable.

       +k8     This option resets the allowC1Printable resource.

       -kt keyboardtype
               This  option  sets  the  keyboardType resource.  Possible values include: “unknown”, “default”, “hp”,
               “sco”, “sun”, “tcap” and “vt220”.

               The value “unknown”, causes the corresponding resource to be ignored.

               The value “default”, suppresses the associated resources  hpFunctionKeys,  scoFunctionKeys,  sunFunc‐
               tionKeys, tcapFunctionKeys and sunKeyboard, using the Sun/PC keyboard layout.

       -l      Turn  logging  on.   Normally  logging  is not supported, due to security concerns.  Some versions of
               xterm may have logging enabled.  The logfile is written to the directory from which xterm is invoked.
               The filename is generated, of the form

                    XtermLog.XXXXXX

               or

                    Xterm.log.hostname.yyyy.mm.dd.hh.mm.ss.XXXXXX

               depending on how xterm was built.

       +l      Turn logging off.

       -lc     Turn  on support of various encodings according to the users' locale setting, i.e., LC_ALL, LC_CTYPE,
               or LANG environment variables.  This is achieved by turning on UTF-8 mode and by  invoking  luit  for
               conversion  between locale encodings and UTF-8.  (luit is not invoked in UTF-8 locales.)  This corre‐
               sponds to the locale resource.

               The actual list of encodings which are supported is determined by luit.  Consult the luit manual page
               for further details.

               See also the discussion of the -u8 option which supports UTF-8 locales.

       +lc     Turn  off  support  of  automatic selection of locale encodings.  Conventional 8bit mode or, in UTF-8
               locales or with -u8 option, UTF-8 mode will be used.

       -lcc path
               File name for the encoding converter from/to locale encodings and UTF-8 which is used with -lc option
               or locale resource.  This corresponds to the localeFilter resource.

       -leftbar
               Force  scrollbar  to  the  left  side  of VT100 screen.  This is the default, unless you have set the
               rightScrollBar resource.

       -lf filename
               Specify the log-filename.  See the -l option.

       -ls     This option indicates that the shell that is started in the xterm window will be a login shell (i.e.,
               the first character of argv[0] will be a dash, indicating to the shell that it should read the user's
               .login or .profile).

               The -ls flag and the loginShell resource are ignored if -e is also given, because xterm does not know
               how  to  make the shell start the given command after whatever it does when it is a login shell - the
               user's shell of choice need not be a Bourne shell after all.  Also, xterm -e is supposed to provide a
               consistent  functionality  for  other applications that need to start text-mode programs in a window,
               and if loginShell were not ignored, the result of ~/.profile might interfere with that.

               If you do want the effect of -ls and -e simultaneously, you may get away with something like

                   xterm -e /bin/bash -l -c "my command here"

               Finally, -ls is not completely ignored, because xterm -ls -e does write  a  /var/log/wtmp  entry  (if
               configured to do so), whereas xterm -e does not.

       -maximized
               This  option  indicates  that  xterm should ask the window manager to maximize its layout on startup.
               This corresponds to the maximized resource.

               Maximizing is not the reverse of iconifying; it is possible to do both with certain window managers.

       +maximized
               This option indicates that xterm should ask the window manager to not maximize its layout on startup.

       +ls     This option indicates that the shell that is started should not be a login shell (i.e., it will be  a
               normal “subshell”).

       -mb     This  option indicates that xterm should ring a margin bell when the user types near the right end of
               a line.

       +mb     This option indicates that margin bell should not be rung.

       -mc milliseconds
               This option specifies the maximum time between multi-click selections.

       -mesg   Turn off the messages resource, i.e., disallow write access to the terminal.

       +mesg   Turn on the messages resource, i.e., allow write access to the terminal.

       -mk_width
               Set the mkWidth resource to “true”.  This makes xterm use a built-in version  of  the  wide-character
               width calculation.  The default is “false”

       +mk_width
               Reset the mkWidth resource.

       -ms color
               This  option  specifies the color to be used for the pointer cursor.  The default is to use the fore‐
               ground color.  This sets the pointerColor resource.

       -nb number
               This option specifies the number of characters from the right end of a line at which the margin bell,
               if enabled, will ring.  The default is “10”.

       -nul    This option disables the display of underlining.

       +nul    This option enables the display of underlining.

       -pc     This option enables the PC-style use of bold colors (see boldColors resource).

       +pc     This option disables the PC-style use of bold colors.

       -pob    This option indicates that the window should be raised whenever a Control-G is received.

       +pob    This option indicates that the window should not be raised whenever a Control-G is received.

       -rightbar
               Force scrollbar to the right side of VT100 screen.

       -rvc    This option disables the display of characters with reverse attribute as color.

       +rvc    This option enables the display of characters with reverse attribute as color.

       -rw     This  option  indicates that reverse-wraparound should be allowed.  This allows the cursor to back up
               from the leftmost column of one line to the rightmost column of the previous line.  This is very use‐
               ful  for  editing  long  shell command lines and is encouraged.  This option can be turned on and off
               from the “VT Options” menu.

       +rw     This option indicates that reverse-wraparound should not be allowed.

       -s      This option indicates that xterm may scroll asynchronously, meaning that the screen does not have  to
               be  kept  completely up to date while scrolling.  This allows xterm to run faster when network laten‐
               cies are very high and is typically useful when running across a very large internet  or  many  gate‐
               ways.

       +s      This option indicates that xterm should scroll synchronously.

       -samename
               Does  not send title and icon name change requests when the request would have no effect: the name is
               not changed.  This has the advantage of preventing flicker and the disadvantage of requiring an extra
               round trip to the server to find out the previous value.  In practice this should never be a problem.

       +samename
               Always send title and icon name change requests.

       -sb     This option indicates that some number of lines that are scrolled off the top of the window should be
               saved and that a scrollbar should be displayed so that those lines can be viewed.  This option may be
               turned on and off from the “VT Options” menu.

       +sb     This option indicates that a scrollbar should not be displayed.

       -selbg color
               This  option  specifies  the  color  to  use  for the background of selected text.  If not specified,
               reverse video is used.  See the discussion of the highlightColor resource.

       -selfg color
               This option specifies the color to use for selected text.  If not specified, reverse video  is  used.
               See the discussion of the highlightTextColor resource.

       -sf     This option indicates that Sun Function Key escape codes should be generated for function keys.

       +sf     This option indicates that the standard escape codes should be generated for function keys.

       -sh number
               scale line-height values by the given number.  See the discussion of the scaleHeight resource.

       -si     This  option  indicates that output to a window should not automatically reposition the screen to the
               bottom of the scrolling region.  This option can be turned on and off from the “VT Options” menu.

       +si     This option indicates that output to a window should cause it to scroll to the bottom.

       -sk     This option indicates that pressing a key while using the scrollbar to review previous lines of  text
               should  cause the window to be repositioned automatically in the normal position at the bottom of the
               scroll region.

       +sk     This option indicates that pressing a key while using the scrollbar should not cause the window to be
               repositioned.

       -sl number
               This  option specifies the number of lines to save that have been scrolled off the top of the screen.
               This corresponds to the saveLines resource.  The default is “64”.

       -sm     This option, corresponding to the sessionMgt resource, indicates that xterm  should  set  up  session
               manager callbacks.

       +sm     This option indicates that xterm should not set up session manager callbacks.

       -sp     This  option  indicates  that  Sun/PC keyboard should be assumed, providing mapping for keypad “+' to
               “,', and CTRL-F1 to F13, CTRL-F2 to F14, etc.

       +sp     This option indicates that the standard escape codes should be  generated  for  keypad  and  function
               keys.

       -t      This  option indicates that xterm should start in Tektronix mode, rather than in VT102 mode.  Switch‐
               ing between the two windows is done using the “Options” menus.  Termcap(5)  entries  that  work  with
               xterm  “tek4014”,  “tek4015”,  “tek4012”,  “tek4013”,  “tek4010”,  and  “dumb”.   xterm automatically
               searches the termcap file in this order for these entries and then sets the “TERM” and the  “TERMCAP”
               environment variables.

       +t      This option indicates that xterm should start in VT102 mode.

       -tb     This option, corresponding to the toolBar resource, indicates that xterm should display a toolbar (or
               menubar) at the top of its window.  The buttons in the toolbar correspond to the popup  menus,  e.g.,
               control/left/mouse for “Main Options”.

       +tb     This option indicates that xterm should not set up a toolbar.

       -ti term_id
               Specify the name used by xterm to select the correct response to terminal ID queries.  It also speci‐
               fies the emulation level, used to determine the type of response to a  DA  control  sequence.   Valid
               values  include  vt52,  vt100, vt101, vt102, vt220, and vt240 (the “vt” is optional).  The default is
               “vt420”.  The term_id argument specifies the terminal ID to use.  (This is the same as the  decTermi‐
               nalID resource).

       -tm string
               This option specifies a series of terminal setting keywords followed by the characters that should be
               bound to those functions, similar to the stty program.  The keywords and their values  are  described
               in detail in the ttyModes resource.

       -tn name
               This  option  specifies the name of the terminal type to be set in the TERM environment variable.  It
               corresponds to the termName resource.  This terminal type must exist in the terminal database  (term‐
               cap or terminfo, depending on how xterm is built) and should have li# and co# entries.  If the termi‐
               nal type is not found, xterm uses the built-in list “xterm”, “vt102”, etc.

       -u8     This option sets the utf8 resource.  When utf8 is set, xterm interprets incoming data as UTF-8.  This
               sets  the wideChars resource as a side-effect, but the UTF-8 mode set by this option prevents it from
               being turned off.  If you must turn it on and off, use the wideChars resource.

               This option and the utf8 resource are overridden by the -lc and  -en  options  and  locale  resource.
               That  is,  if  xterm  has  been compiled to support luit, and the locale resource is not “false” this
               option is ignored.  We recommend using the -lc option or the “locale: true” resource in UTF-8 locales
               when  your operating system supports locale, or -en UTF-8 option or the “locale: UTF-8” resource when
               your operating system does not support locale.

       +u8     This option resets the utf8 resource.

       -uc     This option makes the cursor underlined instead of a box.

       +uc     This option makes the cursor a box instead of underlined.

       -ulc    This option disables the display of characters with underline attribute as  color  rather  than  with
               underlining.

       +ulc    This  option  enables  the  display  of characters with underline attribute as color rather than with
               underlining.

       -ulit   This option, corresponding to the italicULMode resource, disables  the  display  of  characters  with
               underline attribute as italics rather than with underlining.

       +ulit   This  option,  corresponding  to  the  italicULMode  resource, enables the display of characters with
               underline attribute as italics rather than with underlining.

       -ut     This option indicates that xterm should not write a record into the the system utmp log file.

       +ut     This option indicates that xterm should write a record into the system utmp log file.

       -vb     This option indicates that a visual bell is preferred over an audible one.  Instead  of  ringing  the
               terminal bell whenever a Control-G is received, the window will be flashed.

       +vb     This option indicates that a visual bell should not be used.

       -wc     This  option sets the wideChars resource.  When wideChars is set, xterm maintains internal structures
               for 16-bit characters.  If you do not set this resource to  “true”,  xterm  will  ignore  the  escape
               sequence which turns UTF-8 mode on and off.  The default is “false”.

       +wc     This option resets the wideChars resource.

       -wf     This option indicates that xterm should wait for the window to be mapped the first time before start‐
               ing the subprocess so that the initial terminal size settings and environment variables are  correct.
               It is the application's responsibility to catch subsequent terminal size changes.

       +wf     This option indicates that xterm should not wait before starting the subprocess.

       -ziconbeep percent
               Same  as zIconBeep resource.  If percent is non-zero, xterms that produce output while iconified will
               cause an XBell sound at the given volume and have “***” prepended to their icon titles.  Most  window
               managers  will  detect  this change immediately, showing you which window has the output.  (A similar
               feature was in x10 xterm.)

       -C      This option indicates that this window should receive console output.  This is not supported  on  all
               systems.   To  obtain  console output, you must be the owner of the console device, and you must have
               read and write permission for it.  If you are running X under xdm on the console screen you may  need
               to  have the session startup and reset programs explicitly change the ownership of the console device
               in order to get this option to work.

       -Sccn   This option allows xterm to be used as an input and output channel for an  existing  program  and  is
               sometimes  used  in specialized applications.  The option value specifies the last few letters of the
               name of a pseudo-terminal to use in slave mode, plus the number of the inherited file descriptor.  If
               the  option  contains a “/” character, that delimits the characters used for the pseudo-terminal name
               from the file descriptor.  Otherwise, exactly two characters are used from the option for the pseudo-
               terminal  name,  the  remainder is the file descriptor.  Examples (the first two are equivalent since
               the descriptor follows the last “/”):

                   -S/dev/pts/123/45
                   -S123/45
                   -Sab34

               Note that xterm does not close any file descriptor which it did not open for its own use.  It is pos‐
               sible (though probably not portable) to have an application which passes an open file descriptor down
               to xterm past the initialization or the -S option to a process running in the xterm.

   OLD OPTIONS
       The following command line arguments are provided for compatibility with older versions.   They  may  not  be
       supported in the next release as the X Toolkit provides standard options that accomplish the same task.

       %geom   This  option  specifies the preferred size and position of the Tektronix window.  It is shorthand for
               specifying the “*tekGeometry” resource.

       #geom   This option specifies the preferred position of the icon window.  It is shorthand for specifying  the
               “*iconGeometry” resource.

       -T string
               This option specifies the title for xterm's windows.  It is equivalent to -title.

       -n string
               This  option specifies the icon name for xterm's windows.  It is shorthand for specifying the “*icon‐
               Name” resource.  Note that this is not the same as the toolkit option -name (see below).  The default
               icon name is the application name.

               If no suitable icon is found, xterm provides a compiled-in pixmap.

       -r      This  option  indicates  that  reverse video should be simulated by swapping the foreground and back‐
               ground colors.  It is equivalent to -rv.

       -w number
               This option specifies the width in pixels of the border surrounding the window.  It is equivalent  to
               -borderwidth or -bw.

   X TOOLKIT OPTIONS
       The following standard X Toolkit command line arguments are commonly used with xterm:

       -bd color
               This option specifies the color to use for the border of the window.  The corresponding resource name
               is borderColor.  xterm uses the X Toolkit default, which is “XtDefaultForeground”.

       -bg color
               This option specifies the color to use for the background of the window.  The corresponding  resource
               name is background.  The default is “XtDefaultBackground”.

       -bw number
               This option specifies the width in pixels of the border surrounding the window.

               This  appears to be a legacy of older X releases.  It sets the borderWidth resource of the shell wid‐
               get, and may provide advice to your window manager to set the thickness of the  window  frame.   Most
               window  managers  do not use this information.  See the -b option, which controls the inner border of
               the xterm window.

       -display display
               This option specifies the X server to contact; see X(7).

       -fg color
               This option specifies the color to use for displaying text.  The corresponding resource name is fore‐
               ground.  The default is “XtDefaultForeground”.

       -fn font
               This  option  specifies  the  font to be used for displaying normal text.  The corresponding resource
               name is font.  The resource value default is fixed.

       -font font
               This is the same as -fn.

       -geometry geometry
               This option specifies the preferred size and position of the VT102 window; see X(7).

       -iconic This option indicates that xterm should ask the window manager to start it as an icon rather than  as
               the normal window.  The corresponding resource name is iconic.

       -name name
               This  option specifies the application name under which resources are to be obtained, rather than the
               default executable file name.  Name should not contain “.” or “*” characters.

       -rv     This option indicates that reverse video should be simulated by swapping  the  foreground  and  back‐
               ground colors.  The corresponding resource name is reverseVideo.

       +rv     Disable the simulation of reverse video by swapping foreground and background colors.

       -title string
               This  option specifies the window title string, which may be displayed by window managers if the user
               so chooses.  The default title is the command line specified after the -e option, if  any,  otherwise
               the application name.

       -xrm resourcestring
               This  option specifies a resource string to be used.  This is especially useful for setting resources
               that do not have separate command line options.

RESOURCES
       The program understands all of the core X Toolkit resource names and classes.  Application specific resources
       (e.g., “XTerm.NAME”) follow:

       backarrowKeyIsErase (class BackarrowKeyIsErase)
               Tie the VTxxx backarrowKey and ptyInitialErase resources together by setting the DECBKM state accord‐
               ing to whether the initial value of stty erase is a backspace  (8)  or  delete  (127)  character.   A
               “false” value disables this feature.  The default is “True”.

       fullscreen (class Fullscreen)
               Specifies  whether  or not xterm should ask the window manager to use a fullscreen layout on startup.
               Xterm accepts either a keyword (ignoring case) or the number shown in parentheses:

               false (0)
                  Fullscreen layout is not used initially, but may be later via menu-selection or control sequence.

               true (1)
                  Fullscreen layout is used initially, but may be  disabled  later  via  menu-selection  or  control
                  sequence.

               always (2)
                  Fullscreen  layout  is  used initially, and cannot be disabled later via menu-selection or control
                  sequence.

               never (3)
                  Fullscreen layout is not used, and cannot be enabled later via menu-selection or control sequence.

               The default is “false”.

       hold (class Hold)
               If true, xterm will not immediately destroy its window when the shell  command  completes.   It  will
               wait until you use the window manager to destroy/kill the window, or if you use the menu entries that
               send a signal, e.g., HUP or KILL.  You may scroll back, select text, etc., to perform most  graphical
               operations.   Resizing  the display will lose data, however, since this involves interaction with the
               shell which is no longer running.

       hpFunctionKeys (class HpFunctionKeys)
               Specifies whether or not HP Function Key escape codes should be generated for function  keys  instead
               of standard escape sequences.

               See also the keyboardType resource.

       iconGeometry (class IconGeometry)
               Specifies  the  preferred size and position of the application when iconified.  It is not necessarily
               obeyed by all window managers.

       iconHint (class IconHint)
               Specifies a icon which will be added to the window manager hints.  xterm provides no default value.

               Set this resource to “none” to omit the hint entirely, using whatever the window manager may decide.

               If the iconHint resource is given (or is set via the -n option) xterm searches for a pixmap file with
               that name, in the current directory as well as in /usr/share/pixmaps.  if the resource does not spec‐
               ify an absolute pathname.  In each case, xterm adds “_48x48” and/or “.xpm” to the filename after try‐
               ing  without  those suffixes.  If it is able to load the file, xterm sets the window manager hint for
               the icon-pixmap.  These pixmaps are distributed with xterm, and can optionally be compiled-in:

               ·   mini.xterm_16x16, mini.xterm_32x32, mini.xterm_48x48

               ·   filled-xterm_16x16 filled-xterm_32x32 filled-xterm_48x48

               ·   xterm_16x16 xterm_32x32 xterm_48x48

               ·   xterm-color_16x16 xterm-color_32x32 xterm-color_48x48

               In either case, xterm allows for adding a “_48x48” to  specify  the  largest  of  the  pixmaps  as  a
               default.  That is, “mini.xterm” is the same as “mini.xterm_48x48”.

               If  no  explicit iconHint resource is given (or if none of the compiled-in names matches), xterm uses
               “mini.xterm” (which is always compiled-in).

               The iconHint resource has no effect on “desktop” files, including “panel” and “menu”.  Those are typ‐
               ically  set  via  a  “.desktop” file; xterm provides samples for itself (and the uxterm script).  The
               more capable desktop systems allow changing the icon on a per-user basis.

       iconName (class IconName)
               Specifies a label for xterm when iconified.  xterm provides no default value;  some  window  managers
               may assume the application name, e.g., “xterm”.

               Setting  the  iconName  resource  sets  the  icon label unless overridden by zIconBeep or the control
               sequences which change the window and icon labels.

       keyboardType (class KeyboardType)
               Enables one (or none) of the various keyboard-type resources: hpFunctionKeys,  scoFunctionKeys,  sun‐
               FunctionKeys,  tcapFunctionKeys  and  sunKeyboard.   The resource's value should be one of the corre‐
               sponding strings “hp”, “sco”, “sun”, “tcap” or “vt220”.  The individual resources  are  provided  for
               legacy support; this resource is simpler to use.

               The default is “unknown”, i.e., none of the associated resources are set via this resource.

       maxBufSize (class MaxBufSize)
               Specify  the  maximum  size  of  the input buffer.  The default is “32768”.  You cannot set this to a
               value less than the minBufSize resource.  It will be increased as needed to make  that  value  evenly
               divide this one.

               On some systems you may want to increase one or both of the maxBufSize and minBufSize resource values
               to achieve better performance if the operating system prefers larger buffer sizes.

       maximized (class Maximized)
               Specifies whether or not xterm should ask the window manager to maximize its layout on startup.   The
               default is “false”.

       messages (class Messages)
               Specifies  whether  write  access to the terminal is allowed initially.  See mesg(1).  The default is
               “true”.

       menuLocale (class MenuLocale)
               Specify the locale used for character-set computations when loading the popup  menus.   Use  this  to
               improve  initialization  performance  of the Athena popup menus, which may load unnecessary (and very
               large) fonts, e.g., in a locale having UTF-8 encoding.  The default is “C” (POSIX).

               To use the current locale (only useful if you have localized  the  resource  settings  for  the  menu
               entries), set the resource to an empty string.

       minBufSize (class MinBufSize)
               Specify  the  minimum  size of the input buffer, i.e., the amount of data that xterm requests on each
               read.  The default is “4096”.  You cannot set this to a value less than 64.

       omitTranslation (class OmitTranslation)
               Selectively omit one or more parts of xterm's default translations at startup.  The resource value is
               a  comma-separated  list  of keywords, which may be abbreviated: “fullscreen”, “scroll-lock”, “shift-
               fonts” or “wheel-mouse”.  Xterm also recognizes “default”, but omitting that will  make  the  program
               unusable unless you provide a similar definition in your resource settings.

       ptyHandshake (class PtyHandshake)
               If  “true”,  xterm will perform handshaking during initialization to ensure that the parent and child
               processes update the utmp and stty state.

               See also waitForMap which waits for the pseudo-terminal's notion of the screen size, and  ptySttySize
               which resets the screen size after other terminal initialization is complete.  The default is “true”.

       ptyInitialErase (class PtyInitialErase)
               If  “true”,  xterm  will  use the pseudo-terminal's sense of the stty erase value.  If “false”, xterm
               will set the stty erase value to match its own configuration, using the kb string  from  the  termcap
               entry  as  a  reference, if available.  In either case, the result is applied to the TERMCAP variable
               which xterm sets.

               See also the ttyModes resource, which may modify this.  The default is “false”.

       ptySttySize (class PtySttySize)
               If “true”, xterm will reset the screen size after  terminal  initialization  is  complete.   This  is
               needed  for  some systems whose pseudo-terminals cannot propagate terminal characteristics.  Where it
               is not needed, it can interfere with other methods for setting the intial screen size, e.g., via win‐
               dow manager interaction.

               See  also  waitForMap  which waits for a handshake-message giving the pseudo-terminal's notion of the
               screen size.  The default is “false” on Linux and OS X systems, “true” otherwise.

       sameName (class SameName)
               If the value of this resource is “true”, xterm does not send title and icon name change requests when
               the  request  would  have  no  effect: the name is not changed.  This has the advantage of preventing
               flicker and the disadvantage of requiring an extra round trip to the server to find out the  previous
               value.  In practice this should never be a problem.  The default is “true”.

       scaleHeight (class ScaleHeight)
               Scale  line-height  values  by  the  resource value, which is limited to “0.9” to “1.5”.  The default
               value is “1.0”,

               While this resource applies to either bitmap or TrueType fonts, its main  purpose  is  to  help  work
               around incompatible changes in the Xft library's font metrics.  Xterm checks the font metrics to find
               what the library claims are the bounding boxes for each glyph (character).  However,  some  of  Xft's
               features  (such  as the autohinter) can cause the glyphs to be scaled larger than the bounding boxes,
               and be partly overwritten by the next row.

               See useClipping for a related resource.

       scoFunctionKeys (class ScoFunctionKeys)
               Specifies whether or not SCO Function Key escape codes should be generated for function keys  instead
               of standard escape sequences.

               See also the keyboardType resource.

       sessionMgt (class SessionMgt)
               If  the  value of this resource is “true”, xterm sets up session manager callbacks for XtNdieCallback
               and XtNsaveCallback.  The default is “true”.

       sunFunctionKeys (class SunFunctionKeys)
               Specifies whether or not Sun Function Key escape codes should be generated for function keys  instead
               of standard escape sequences.

               See also the keyboardType resource.

       sunKeyboard (class SunKeyboard)
               Specifies whether or not Sun/PC keyboard layout should be assumed rather than DEC VT220.  This causes
               the keypad “+' to be mapped to “,'.  and CTRL F1-F12 to F11-F20, depending  on  the  setting  of  the
               ctrlFKeys  resource.   so  xterm  emulates a DEC VT220 more accurately.  Otherwise (the default, with
               sunKeyboard set to “false”), xterm uses PC-style bindings for the function keys and keypad.

               PC-style bindings use the Shift, Alt, Control and Meta keys as modifiers for function-keys and keypad
               (see  the  document  Xterm  Control  Sequences  for details).  The PC-style bindings are analogous to
               PCTerm, but not the same thing.  Normally these bindings do not conflict with the use of the Meta key
               as  described for the eightBitInput resource.  If they do, note that the PC-style bindings are evalu‐
               ated first.

               See also the keyboardType resource.

       tcapFunctionKeys (class TcapFunctionKeys)
               Specifies whether or not function key escape codes read from the  termcap/terminfo  entry  should  be
               generated for function keys instead of standard escape sequences.  The default is “false”, i.e., this
               feature is disabled.

               See also the keyboardType resource.

       termName (class TermName)
               Specifies the terminal type name to be set in the TERM environment variable.

       title (class Title)
               Specifies a string that may be used by the window manager when displaying this application.

       toolBar (class ToolBar)
               Specifies whether or not the toolbar should be displayed.  The default is “true”.

       ttyModes (class TtyModes)
               Specifies a string containing terminal setting keywords and the  characters  to  which  they  may  be
               bound.   Allowable  keywords  include:  brk, dsusp, eof, eol, eol2, erase, erase2, flush, intr, kill,
               lnext, quit, rprnt, start, status, stop, susp, swtch and weras.  Control characters may be  specified
               as  ^char (e.g., ^c or ^u) and ^? may be used to indicate delete (127).  Use ^- to denote undef.  Use
               \034 to represent ^\, since a literal backslash in an X resource escapes the next character.

               This is very useful for overriding the default terminal settings without having to do an  stty  every
               time  an  xterm  is  started.  Note, however, that the stty program on a given host may use different
               keywords; xterm's table is built-in.

               If the ttyModes resource specifies a value for erase, that  overrides  the  ptyInitialErase  resource
               setting, i.e., xterm initializes the terminal to match that value.

       useInsertMode (class UseInsertMode)
               Force  use of insert mode by adding appropriate entries to the TERMCAP environment variable.  This is
               useful if the system termcap is broken.  The default is “false”.

       utmpDisplayId (class UtmpDisplayId)
               Specifies whether or not xterm should try to record the display identifier (display number and screen
               number) as well as the hostname in the system utmp log file.  The default is “true”.

       utmpInhibit (class UtmpInhibit)
               Specifies  whether or not xterm should try to record the user's terminal in the system utmp log file.
               If true, xterm will not try.  The default is “false”.

       waitForMap (class WaitForMap)
               Specifies whether or not xterm should wait for the initial window map before starting the subprocess.
               This  is  part  of the ptyHandshake logic.  When xterm is directed to wait in this fashion, it passes
               the terminal size from the display end of the pseudo-terminal to the terminal I/O  connection,  e.g.,
               according to the window manager.  Otherwise, it uses the size as given in resource values or command-
               line option -geom.  The default is “false”.

       zIconBeep (class ZIconBeep)
               Same as -ziconbeep command line argument.  If the value of this resource  is  non-zero,  xterms  that
               produce  output  while  iconified  will  cause  an  XBell  sound  at the given volume and have “*** ”
               prepended to their icon titles.  Most window managers will detect this  change  immediately,  showing
               you which window has the output.  (A similar feature was in x10 xterm.)  The default is “false”.

       zIconTitleFormat (class ZIconTitleFormat)
               Allow customization of the string used in the zIconBeep feature.  The default value is “*** %s”.

               If  the  resource  value contains a “%s”, then xterm inserts the icon title at that point rather than
               prepending the string to the icon title.  (Only the first “%s” is used).

   VT100 Widget Resources
       The following resources are specified as part of the vt100 widget (class VT100).  They are specified by  pat‐
       terns such as “XTerm.vt100.NAME”.

       If  your  xterm is configured to support the “toolbar”, then those patterns need an extra level for the form-
       widget which holds the toolbar and vt100 widget.  A wildcard between the top-level “XTerm”  and  the  “vt100”
       widget makes the resource settings work for either, e.g., “XTerm*vt100.NAME”.

       activeIcon (class ActiveIcon)
               Specifies  whether  or  not active icon windows are to be used when the xterm window is iconified, if
               this feature is compiled into xterm.  The active icon is a miniature representation of the content of
               the  window  and  will  update  as  the content changes.  Not all window managers necessarily support
               application icon windows.  Some window managers will allow you to enter keystrokes  into  the  active
               icon window.  The default is “default”.

               Xterm accepts either a keyword (ignoring case) or the number shown in parentheses:

               false (0)
                      No active icon is shown.

               true (1)
                      The active icon is shown.  If you are using twm, use this setting to enable active-icons.

               default (2)
                      xterm  checks at startup, and shows an active icon only for window managers which it can iden‐
                      tify and which are known to support the feature.  These are fvwm (full  support),  and  window
                      maker  (limited).   A  few other windows managers (such as twm and ctwm) support active icons,
                      but do not support the extensions which allow xterm to identify the window manager.

       allowBoldFonts (class AllowBoldFonts)
               When set to “false”, xterm will not use bold fonts.  This overrides both the alwaysBoldMode  and  the
               boldMode resources.  alwaysBoldMode (class AlwaysBoldMode)

       allowC1Printable (class AllowC1Printable)
               If true, overrides the mapping of C1 controls (codes 128-159) to make them be treated as if they were
               printable characters.  Although this corresponds to no particular standard, some users insist it is a
               VT100.  The default is “false”.

       allowColorOps (class AllowColorOps)
               Specifies whether control sequences that set/query the dynamic colors should be allowed.  ANSI colors
               are unaffected by this resource setting.  The default is “true”.

       allowFontOps (class AllowFontOps)
               Specifies whether control sequences that set/query the  font  should  be  allowed.   The  default  is
               “false”.

       allowPasteControls (class AllowPasteControls)
            If  true,  allow  control characters such as BEL and CAN to be pasted.  Formatting characters (tab, new‐
            line) are always allowed.  Other C0 control characters are suppressed unless this resource  is  enabled.
            The  exact set of control characters (C0 and C1) depends upon whether UTF-8 encoding is used, as well as
            the allowC1Printable resource.  The default is “false”.

       allowScrollLock (class AllowScrollLock)
               Specifies whether control sequences that set/query the Scroll Lock key should be allowed, as well  as
               whether the Scroll Lock key responds to user's keypress.  The default is “false”.

               When this feature is enabled, xterm will sense the state of the Scroll Lock key each time it acquires
               focus.  Pressing the Scroll Lock key toggles xterm's internal state, as well as toggling the  associ‐
               ated  LED.   While  the  Scroll  Lock is active, xterm attempts to keep a viewport on the same set of
               lines.  If the current viewport is scrolled past the limit set by the saveLines resource, then Scroll
               Lock has no further effect.

               The  reason  for  setting  the  default  to “false” is to avoid user surprise.  This key is generally
               unused in keyboard configurations, and has not acquired a standard meaning even when it  is  used  in
               that manner.  Consequently, users have assigned it for ad hoc purposes.

       allowSendEvents (class AllowSendEvents)
               Specifies  whether  or  not synthetic key and button events (generated using the X protocol SendEvent
               request) should be interpreted or discarded.  The default is  “false”  meaning  they  are  discarded.
               Note  that  allowing  such  events  would  create a very large security hole, therefore enabling this
               resource forcefully disables the allowXXXOps resources.  The default is “false”.

       allowTcapOps (class AllowTcapOps)
               Specifies whether control sequences that query the terminal's notion of its function-key strings,  as
               termcap or terminfo capabilities should be allowed.  The default is “true”.

               A few programs, e.g., vim, use this feature to get an accurate description of the terminal's capabil‐
               ities, independent of the termcap/terminfo setting:

               ·   xterm can tell the querying program how many colors it supports.  This is a  constant,  depending
                   on  how  it  is compiled, typically 16.  It does not change if you alter resource settings, e.g.,
                   the boldColors resource.

               ·   xterm can tell the querying program what strings are sent by modified  (shift-,  control-,  alt-)
                   function-  and keypad-keys.  Reporting control- and alt-modifiers is a feature that relies on the
                   ncurses extended naming.

       allowTitleOps (class AllowTitleOps)
               Specifies whether control sequences that modify the window title or icon name should be allowed.  The
               default is “true”.

       allowWindowOps (class AllowWindowOps)
               Specifies  whether  extended  window  control sequences (as used in dtterm) should be allowed.  These
               include several control sequences which manipulate the window size or position, as well as  reporting
               these  values  and the title or icon name.  Each of these can be abused in a script; curiously enough
               most terminal emulators that implement these restrict only a small part of the repertoire.  For fine-
               tuning, see disallowedWindowOps.  The default is “false”.

       altIsNotMeta (class AltIsNotMeta)
               If  “true”,  treat the Alt-key as if it were the Meta-key.  Your keyboard may happen to be configured
               so they are the same.  But if they are not, this allows you to use  the  same  prefix-  and  shifting
               operations  with  the  Alt-key  as  with  the Meta-key.  See altSendsEscape and metaSendsEscape.  The
               default is “false”.

       altSendsEscape (class AltSendsEscape)
               This is an additional keyboard operation that may be processed after the logic  for  metaSendsEscape.
               It is only available if the altIsNotMeta resource is set.

               ·   If “true”, Alt characters (a character combined with the modifier associated with left/right Alt-
                   keys) are converted into a two-character sequence with the  character  itself  preceded  by  ESC.
                   This  applies  as  well  to function key control sequences, unless xterm sees that Alt is used in
                   your key translations.

               ·   If “false”, Alt characters input from the keyboard cause a shift to 8-bit characters  (just  like
                   metaSendsEscape).   By combining the Alt- and Meta-modifiers, you can create corresponding combi‐
                   nations of ESC-prefix and 8-bit characters.

               The default is “False”.  Xterm provides a menu option for toggling this resource.

       alternateScroll (class ScrollCond)
               If “true”, the scroll-back and scroll-forw actions send cursor-up and -down keys when xterm  is  dis‐
               playing the alternate screen.  The default is “false”.

               The alternateScroll state can also be set using a control sequence.

       alwaysBoldMode (class AlwaysBoldMode)
               Specifies  whether  xterm  should  check  if  the  normal and bold fonts are distinct before deciding
               whether to use overstriking to simulate bold fonts.  If this resource is true, xterm  does  not  make
               the  check  for  distinct  fonts  when  deciding how to handle the boldMode resource.  The default is
               “false”.

               boldMode   alwaysBoldMode   Comparison   Action
               ────────────────────────────────────────────────────
               false      false            ignored      use font
               false      true             ignored      use font
               true       false            same         overstrike
               true       false            different    use font
               true       true             ignored      overstrike

               This resource is used only for bitmap fonts:

               ·   When using bitmap fonts, it is possible that the font server will approximate the  bold  font  by
                   rescaling  it  from  a different font size than expected.  The alwaysBoldMode resource allows the
                   user to override the (sometimes poor) resulting bold font with overstriking (which  is  at  least
                   consistent).

               ·   The problem does not occur with TrueType fonts (though there can be other unnecessary issues such
                   as different coverage of the normal and bold fonts).

               As an alternative, setting the allowBoldFonts resource to false overrides both the alwaysBoldMode and
               the boldMode resources.

       alwaysHighlight (class AlwaysHighlight)
               Specifies  whether or not xterm should always display a highlighted text cursor.  By default (if this
               resource is false), a hollow text cursor is displayed whenever the pointer moves out of the window or
               the window loses the input focus.  The default is “false”.

       alwaysUseMods (class AlwaysUseMods)
               Override  the  numLock resource, telling xterm to use the Alt and Meta modifiers to construct parame‐
               ters for function key sequences even if those modifiers appear in the  translations  resource.   Nor‐
               mally xterm checks if Alt or Meta is used in a translation that would conflict with function key mod‐
               ifiers, and will ignore these modifiers in that special case.  The default is “false”.

       answerbackString (class AnswerbackString)
               Specifies the string that xterm sends in response to an ENQ (control/E) character from the host.  The
               default is a blank string, i.e., “”.  A hardware VT100 implements this feature as a setup option.

       appcursorDefault (class AppcursorDefault)
               If  “true”, the cursor keys are initially in application mode.  This is the same as the VT102 private
               DECCKM mode, The default is “false”.

       appkeypadDefault (class AppkeypadDefault)
               If “true”, the keypad keys are initially in application mode.  The default is “false”.

       assumeAllChars (class AssumeAllChars)
               If “true”, this enables a special case in bitmap fonts to allow the font server to choose how to dis‐
               play missing glyphs.  The default is “false”.

       autoWrap (class AutoWrap)
               Specifies  whether  or  not auto-wraparound should be enabled.  This is the same as the VT102 DECAWM.
               The default is “true”.

       awaitInput (class AwaitInput)
               Specifies whether or not the xterm uses a 50 millisecond timeout to await input (i.e., to support the
               Xaw3d arrow scrollbar).  The default is “false”.

       backarrowKey (class BackarrowKey)
               Specifies whether the backarrow key transmits a backspace (8) or delete (127) character.  This corre‐
               sponds to the DECBKM control sequence.  A “true” value specifies backspace.  The default  is  “True”.
               Pressing the control key toggles this behavior.

       background (class Background)
               Specifies the color to use for the background of the window.  The default is “XtDefaultBackground”.

       bellIsUrgent (class BellIsUrgent)
               Specifies  whether  to  set  the  Urgency  hint for the window manager when making a bell sound.  The
               default is “false”.

       bellOnReset (class BellOnReset)
               Specifies whether to sound a bell when doing a hard reset.  The default is “true”.

       bellSuppressTime (class BellSuppressTime)
               Number of milliseconds after a bell command is sent during which additional bells will be suppressed.
               Default  is  200.  If set non-zero, additional bells will also be suppressed until the server reports
               that processing of the first bell has been completed; this feature is most useful  with  the  visible
               bell.

       boldColors (class ColorMode)
               Specifies whether to combine bold attribute with colors like the IBM PC, i.e., map colors 0 through 7
               to colors 8 through 15.  These normally are the brighter versions of the first 8 colors, hence  bold.
               The default is “true”.

       boldFont (class BoldFont)
               Specifies  the  name  of  the bold font to use instead of overstriking.  There is no default for this
               resource.

               This font must be the same height and width as the normal font, otherwise it is ignored.  If only one
               of  the  normal or bold fonts is specified, it will be used as the normal font and the bold font will
               be produced by overstriking this font.

               See also the discussion of boldMode and alwaysBoldMode resources.

       boldMode (class BoldMode)
               This specifies whether or not text with the bold attribute should  be  overstruck  to  simulate  bold
               fonts  if the resolved bold font is the same as the normal font.  It may be desirable to disable bold
               fonts when color is being used for the bold attribute.

               Note that xterm has one bold font which you may set explicitly.  Xterm attempts to derive a bold font
               for  the other font selections (font1 through font6).  If it cannot find a bold font, it will use the
               normal font.  In each case (whether the explicit resource or the derived font),  if  the  normal  and
               bold fonts are distinct, this resource has no effect.  The default is “true”.

               See the alwaysBoldMode resource which can modify the behavior of this resource.

               Although  xterm  attempts  to  derive  a bold font for other font selections, the font server may not
               cooperate.  Since X11R6, bitmap fonts have been scaled.  The font server claims to provide  the  bold
               font  that xterm requests, but the result is not always readable.  XFree86 introduced a feature which
               can  be  used  to  suppress  the  scaling.    In   the   X   server's   configuration   file   (e.g.,
               “/etc/X11/XFree86”), you can add “:unscaled” to the end of the directory specification for the “misc”
               fonts, which comprise the fixed-pitch fonts that are used by xterm.  For example

                   FontPath                 "/usr/lib/X11/fonts/misc/"

               would become

                   FontPath                 "/usr/lib/X11/fonts/misc/:unscaled"

               Depending on your configuration, the font server may have  its  own  configuration  file.   The  same
               “:unscaled”  can  be  added  to  its configuration file at the end of the directory specification for
               “misc”.

               The bitmap scaling feature is also used by xterm to implement VT102  double-width  and  double-height
               characters.

       brokenLinuxOSC (class BrokenLinuxOSC)
               If  true,  xterm applies a workaround to ignore malformed control sequences that a Linux script might
               send.  Compare the palette control sequences documented in console_codes with ECMA-48.   The  default
               is “true”.

       brokenSelections (class BrokenSelections)
               If  true,  xterm  in  8-bit  mode  will  interpret  STRING selections as carrying text in the current
               locale's encoding.  Normally STRING selections carry ISO-8859-1 encoded text.  Setting this  resource
               to  “true” violates the ICCCM; it may, however, be useful for interacting with some broken X clients.
               The default is “false”.

       brokenStringTerm (class BrokenStringTerm)
               provides a work-around for some ISDN routers which start an application control string  without  com‐
               pleting it.  Set this to “true” if xterm appears to freeze when connecting.  The default is “false”.

               Xterm's state parser recognizes several types of control strings which can contain text, e.g.,

               APC (Application Program Command),
               DCS (Device Control String),
               OSC (Operating System Command),
               PM (Privacy Message), and
               SOS (Start of String),

               Each  should end with a string-terminator (a special character which cannot appear in these strings).
               Ordinary control characters found within the string are  not  ignored;  they  are  processed  without
               interfering  with  the  process of accumulating the control string's content.  Xterm recognizes these
               controls in all modes, although some of the functions may be suppressed after parsing the control.

               When enabled, this feature allows the user to exit from an unterminated control string  when  any  of
               these ordinary control characters are found:

               control/D (used as an end of file in many shells),
               control/H (backspace),
               control/I (tab-feed),
               control/J (line feed aka newline),
               control/K (vertical tab),
               control/L (form feed),
               control/M (carriage return),
               control/N (shift-out),
               control/O (shift-in),
               control/Q (XOFF),
               control/X (cancel)

       c132 (class C132)
               Specifies  whether  or  not the VT102 DECCOLM escape sequence, used to switch between 80 and 132 col‐
               umns, should be honored.  The default is “false”.

       cacheDoublesize (class CacheDoublesize)
               Tells whether to cache double-sized fonts by xterm.  Set this to zero to disable  double-sized  fonts
               altogether.

       cdXtraScroll (class CdXtraScroll)
               Specifies  whether  xterm  should  scroll  to  a  new page when clearing the whole screen.  Like tiX‐
               traScroll, the intent of this option is to provide a picture of the full-screen application's display
               on the scrollback before wiping out the text.  The default for this resource is “false”.

       charClass (class CharClass)
               Specifies  comma-separated lists of character class bindings of the form [low-]high:value.  These are
               used in determining which sets of characters should be treated the same when  doing  cut  and  paste.
               See the CHARACTER CLASSES section.

       cjkWidth (class CjkWidth)
               Specifies  whether  xterm should follow the traditional East Asian width convention.  When turned on,
               characters with East Asian Ambiguous (A) category in UTR 11 have a column width of 2.  You  may  have
               to set this option to “true” if you have some old East Asian terminal based programs that assume that
               line-drawing characters have a column width of 2.  If this resource is false,  the  mkWidth  resource
               controls  the  choice  between  the  system's  wcwidth  and  xterm's built-in tables.  The default is
               “false”.

       color0 (class Color0)

       color1 (class Color1)

       color2 (class Color2)

       color3 (class Color3)

       color4 (class Color4)

       color5 (class Color5)

       color6 (class Color6)

       color7 (class Color7)
               These specify the colors for the ISO-6429 extension.  The defaults are,  respectively,  black,  red3,
               green3,  yellow3, a customizable dark blue, magenta3, cyan3, and gray90.  The default shades of color
               are chosen to allow the colors 8-15 to be used as brighter versions.

       color8 (class Color8)

       color9 (class Color9)

       color10 (class Color10)

       color11 (class Color11)

       color12 (class Color12)

       color13 (class Color13)

       color14 (class Color14)

       color15 (class Color15)
               These specify the colors for the ISO-6429 extension if the  bold  attribute  is  also  enabled.   The
               default  resource  values  are  respectively,  gray30, red, green, yellow, a customizable light blue,
               magenta, cyan, and white.

       color16 (class Color16)

       through

       color255 (class Color255)
               These specify the colors for the 256-color extension.  The default resource values are for colors  16
               through 231 to make a 6x6x6 color cube, and colors 232 through 255 to make a grayscale ramp.

               Resources  past  color15  are  available as a compile-time option.  Due to a hardcoded limit in the X
               libraries on the total number of resources (to 400), the resources for 256-colors  are  omitted  when
               wide-character  support  and  luit  are  enabled.   Besides inconsistent behavior if only part of the
               resources were allowed, determining the exact cutoff is difficult, and the X libraries tend to  crash
               if  the  number  of  resources exceeds the limit.  The color palette is still initialized to the same
               default values, and can be modified via control sequences.

               On the other hand, the resource limit does permit including the entire range for 88-colors.

       colorAttrMode (class ColorAttrMode)
               Specifies whether colorBD, colorBL, colorRV, and colorUL should override ANSI colors.  If not,  these
               are  displayed only when no ANSI colors have been set for the corresponding position.  The default is
               “false”.

       colorBD (class ColorBD)
               This specifies the color to use to display bold characters if the “colorBDMode” resource is  enabled.
               The default is “XtDefaultForeground”.

               See also the veryBoldColors resource which allows combining bold and color.

       colorBDMode (class ColorAttrMode)
               Specifies  whether characters with the bold attribute should be displayed in color or as bold charac‐
               ters.  Note that setting colorMode off disables all colors, including bold.  The default is “false”.

       colorBL (class ColorBL)
               This specifies the color to use to display blink characters if the “colorBLMode” resource is enabled.
               The default is “XtDefaultForeground”.

               See also the veryBoldColors resource which allows combining underline and color.

       colorBLMode (class ColorAttrMode)
               Specifies  whether  characters with the blink attribute should be displayed in color.  Note that set‐
               ting colorMode off disables all colors, including this.  The default is “false”.

       colorMode (class ColorMode)
               Specifies whether or not recognition of ANSI (ISO-6429)  color  change  escape  sequences  should  be
               enabled.  The default is “true”.

       colorRV (class ColorRV)
               This  specifies  the  color  to  use  to  display reverse characters if the “colorRVMode” resource is
               enabled.  The default is “XtDefaultForeground”.

               See also the veryBoldColors resource which allows combining reverse and color.

       colorRVMode (class ColorAttrMode)
               Specifies whether characters with the reverse attribute should be displayed in color.  Note that set‐
               ting colorMode off disables all colors, including this.  The default is “false”.

       colorUL (class ColorUL)
               This  specifies  the  color  to use to display underlined characters if the “colorULMode” resource is
               enabled.  The default is “XtDefaultForeground”.

               See also the veryBoldColors resource which allows combining underline and color.

       colorULMode (class ColorAttrMode)
               Specifies whether characters with the underline attribute should be displayed in color or  as  under‐
               lined  characters.   Note that setting colorMode off disables all colors, including underlining.  The
               default is “false”.

       combiningChars (class CombiningChars)
               Specifies the number of wide-characters which can be stored in a cell to  overstrike  (combine)  with
               the base character of the cell.  This can be set to values in the range 0 to 4.  The default is “2”.

       ctrlFKeys (class CtrlFKeys)
               In  VT220  keyboard  mode  (see  sunKeyboard resource), specifies the amount by which to shift F1-F12
               given a control modifier (CTRL).  This allows you to generate key symbols for  F10-F20  on  a  Sun/PC
               keyboard.  The default is “10”, which means that CTRL F1 generates the key symbol for F11.

       curses (class Curses)
               Specifies  whether or not the last column bug in more(1) should be worked around.  See the -cu option
               for details.  The default is “false”.

       cursorBlink (class CursorBlink)
               Specifies whether to make the cursor blink.  The default is “false”.

               Xterm uses two variables to determine whether the cursor blinks.  One is set by this  resource.   The
               other  is  set  by  control sequences (private mode 12 and DECSCUSR).  Xterm tests the XOR of the two
               variables.

       cursorColor (class CursorColor)
               Specifies the color to use for the text cursor.  The default is “XtDefaultForeground”.   By  default,
               xterm  attempts  to  keep  this color from being the same as the background color, since it draws the
               cursor by filling the background of a text cell.  The same restriction applies to  control  sequences
               which may change this color.

               Setting  this  resource  overrides  most  of  xterm's adjustments to cursor color.  It will still use
               reverse-video to disallow some cases, such as a black cursor on a black background.

       cursorOffTime (class CursorOffTime)
               Specifies the duration of the “off” part of the cursor blink cycle-time in  milliseconds.   The  same
               timer is used for text blinking.  The default is “300”.

       cursorOnTime (class CursorOnTime)
               Specifies  the  duration  of the “on” part of the cursor blink cycle-time, in milliseconds.  The same
               timer is used for text blinking.  The default is “600”.

       cutNewline (class CutNewline)
               If “false”, triple clicking to select a line does not include the Newline at the end of the line.  If
               “true”, the Newline is selected.  The default is “true”.

       cursorUnderLine (class CursorUnderLine)
               Specifies whether to make the cursor underlined or a box.  The default is “false”.

       cutToBeginningOfLine (class CutToBeginningOfLine)
               If  “false”, triple clicking to select a line selects only from the current word forward.  If “true”,
               the entire line is selected.  The default is “true”.

       decTerminalID (class DecTerminalID)
               Specifies the emulation level (100=VT100, 220=VT220, etc.), used to determine the type of response to
               a  DA  control  sequence.   Leading non-digit characters are ignored, e.g., “vt100” and “100” are the
               same.  The default is “420”.

       defaultString (class DefaultString)
               Specify the character (or string) which xterm will substitute when pasted text includes  a  character
               which cannot be represented in the current encoding.  For instance, pasting UTF-8 text into a display
               of ISO-8859-1 characters will only be able to display codes 0-255, while UTF-8 text can include  Uni‐
               code values above 255.  The default is “#” (a single pound sign).

               If  the  undisplayable text would be double-width, xterm will add a space after the “#” character, to
               give roughly the same layout on the screen as the original text.

       deleteIsDEL (class DeleteIsDEL)
               Specifies whether the Delete key on the editing keypad should  send  DEL  (127)  or  the  VT220-style
               Remove escape sequence.  A “false” value enables the latter.  The default is “Maybe”.

       disallowedColorOps (class DisallowedColorOps)
               Specify which features will be disabled if allowColorOps is false.  This is a comma-separated list of
               names.  The default value is
               SetColor,GetColor,GetAnsiColor

               The names are listed below.  xterm ignores capitalization, but they are shown in mixed-case for clar‐
               ity.

               SetColor
                    Set a specific dynamic color.

               GetColor
                    Report the current setting of a given dynamic color.

               GetAnsiColor
                    Report  the current setting of a given ANSI color (actually any of the colors set via ANSI-style
                    controls).

       disallowedFontOps (class DisallowedFontOps)
               Specify which features will be disabled if allowFontOps is false.  This is a comma-separated list  of
               names.  The default value is
               SetFont,GetFont

               The names are listed below.  xterm ignores capitalization, but they are shown in mixed-case for clar‐
               ity.

               SetFont
                    Set the specified font.

               GetFont
                    Report the specified font.

       disallowedTcapOps (class DisallowedTcapOps)
               Specify which features will be disabled if allowTcapOps is false.  This is a comma-separated list  of
               names.  The default value is
               SetTcap,GetTcap

               The names are listed below.  xterm ignores capitalization, but they are shown in mixed-case for clar‐
               ity.

               SetTcap
                    (not implemented)

               GetTcap
                    Report specified function- and other special keys.

       disallowedWindowOps (class DisallowedWindowOps)
               Specify which features will be disabled if allowWindowOps is false.  This is a  comma-separated  list
               of names, or (for the controls adapted from dtterm the operation number).  The default value is
               1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,11,13,14,18,19,20,21,GetSelection,SetSelection,SetWinLines,SetXprop
       (i.e. no operations are allowed).

               The names are listed below.  xterm ignores capitalization, but they are shown in mixed-case for clar‐
               ity.  Where a number can be used as an alternative, it is given in parentheses after the name.

               GetIconTitle (20)
                    Report xterm window's icon label as a string.

               GetScreenSizeChars (19)

               LowerWin (6)
                    Lower the xterm window to the bottom of the stacking order.

               MaximizeWin (9)
                    Maximize window (i.e., resize to screen size).

               FullscreenWin (10)
                    Use full screen (i.e., resize to screen size, without window decorations).

               MinimizeWin (2)
                    Iconify window.

               PopTitle (23)

               SetWinSizePixels (4)
                    Resize the xterm window to given size in pixels.

               SetXprop
                    Set X property on top-level window.

       dynamicColors (class DynamicColors)
               Specifies whether or not escape sequences to change colors assigned to different attributes are  rec‐
               ognized.

       eightBitControl (class EightBitControl)
               Specifies  whether  or  not  control sequences sent by the terminal should be eight-bit characters or
               escape sequences.  The default is “false”.

       eightBitInput (class EightBitInput)
               If “true”, Meta characters (a single-byte character combined with the Meta modifier key)  input  from
               the  keyboard  are  presented as a single character, modified according to the eightBitMeta resource.
               If “false”, Meta characters are converted into a two-character sequence  with  the  character  itself
               preceded by ESC.  The default is “true”.

               The  metaSendsEscape  and altSendsEscape resources may override this feature.  Generally keyboards do
               not have a key labeled “Meta”, but “Alt” keys are  common,  and  they  are  conventionally  used  for
               “Meta”.   If  they  were  synonymous,  it  would have been reasonable to name this resource “altSend‐
               sEscape”, reversing its sense.  For more background on this, see the meta function in curses.

               Note that the Alt key is not necessarily the same as the Meta modifier.  xmodmap lists your key modi‐
               fiers.   X  defines  modifiers  for shift, (caps) lock and control, as well as 5 additional modifiers
               which are generally used to configure key modifiers.  xterm inspects the same information to find the
               modifier associated with either Meta key (left or right), and uses that key as the Meta modifier.  It
               also looks for the NumLock key, to recognize the modifier which is associated with that.

               If your xmodmap configuration uses the same keycodes for Alt- and Meta-keys, xterm will only see  the
               Alt-key definitions, since those are tested before Meta-keys.  NumLock is tested first.  It is impor‐
               tant to keep these keys distinct; otherwise some of xterm's functionality is not available.

               The eightBitInput resource is tested at startup time.  If “true”, the xterm tries to put the terminal
               into  8-bit mode.  If “false”, on startup, xterm tries to put the terminal into 7-bit mode.  For some
               configurations this is unsuccessful; failure is ignored.  After startup, xterm does  not  change  the
               terminal between 8-bit and 7-bit mode.

               As  originally  implemented  in X11, the resource value did not change after startup.  However (since
               patch #216 in 2006) xterm can modify eightBitInput after startup via a control sequence.  The  corre‐
               sponding  terminfo capabilities smm (set meta mode) and rmm (reset meta mode) have been recognized by
               bash for some time.  Interestingly enough, bash's notion of "meta mode"  differs  from  the  standard
               definition (in the terminfo manual), which describes the change to the eighth bit of a character.  It
               happens that bash views "meta mode" as the ESC character that xterm puts before a  character  when  a
               special  meta  key  is pressed.  bash's early documentation talks about the ESC character and ignores
               the eighth bit.

       eightBitMeta (class EightBitMeta)
               This controls the way xterm modifies the eighth bit of  a  single-byte  key  when  the  eightBitInput
               resource is set.  The default is “locale”.

               The resource value is a string, evaluated as a boolean after startup.

               false
                    The key is sent unmodified.

               locale
                    The key is modified only if the locale uses eight-bit encoding.

               true The key is sent modified.

               never
                    The key is always sent unmodified.

               Except  for  the  never  choice,  xterm  honors the terminfo capabilities smm (set meta mode) and rmm
               (reset meta mode), allowing the feature to be turned on or off dynamically.

               If eightBitMeta is enabled when the locale uses UTF-8, xterm encodes the value as UTF-8 (since  patch
               #183 in 2003).

       eightBitOutput (class EightBitOutput)
               Specifies whether or not eight-bit characters sent from the host should be accepted as is or stripped
               when printed.  The default is “true”, which means that they are accepted as is.

       eightBitSelectTypes (class EightBitSelectTypes)
               Override  xterm's  default  selection  target  list  (see  SELECT/PASTE)  for  selections  in  normal
               (ISO-8859-1) mode.  The default is an empty string, i.e., “”, which does not override anything.

       faceName (class FaceName)
               Specify the pattern for scalable fonts selected from the FreeType library if support for that library
               was compiled into xterm.  There is no default value.

               If not specified, or if there is no match for both normal and bold fonts, xterm uses the bitmap  font
               and related resources.

               It is possible to select suitable bitmap fonts using a script such as this:

                   #!/bin/sh
                   FONT=`xfontsel -print`
                   test -n "$FONT" && xfd -fn "$FONT"

               However (even though xfd accepts a “-fa” option to denote FreeType fonts), xfontsel has not been sim‐
               ilarly extended.  As a workaround, you may try

                   fc-list :scalable=true:spacing=mono: family

               to find a list of scalable fixed-pitch fonts which may be used for the faceName resource value.

       faceNameDoublesize (class FaceNameDoublesize)
               Specify a double-width scalable font for cases where an  application  requires  this,  e.g.,  in  CJK
               applications.  There is no default value.

               If  the  application  uses  double-wide  characters  and this resource is not given, xterm will use a
               scaled version of the font given by faceName.

       faceSize (class FaceSize)
               Specify the pointsize for fonts selected from the FreeType library if support for  that  library  was
               compiled  into  xterm.   The  default is “14.0” On the VT Fonts menu, this corresponds to the Default
               entry.

               Although the default is “14.0”, this may not be the same as the  pointsize  for  the  default  bitmap
               font,  i.e.,  that assigned with the -fn option, or the font resource.  For example, the “fixed” font
               usually has a pointsize of “8.0”.  If you set faceSize to match the size of  the  bitmap  font,  then
               switching between bitmap and TrueType fonts via the font menu will give comparable sizes for the win‐
               dow.

               You can specify the pointsize for TrueType fonts selected with the other  size-related  menu  entries
               such  as  Medium, Huge, etc., by using one of the following resource values.  If you do not specify a
               value, they default to “0.0”, which causes xterm to use the ratio of font sizes from the  correspond‐
               ing bitmap font resources to obtain a TrueType pointsize.

               If  all of the faceSize resources are set, then xterm will use this information to determine the next
               smaller/larger TrueType font for the larger-vt-font() and smaller-vt-font() actions.  If any are  not
               set, xterm will use only the areas of the bitmap fonts.

       faceSize1 (class FaceSize1)
               Specifies the pointsize of the first alternative font.

       faceSize2 (class FaceSize2)
               Specifies the pointsize of the second alternative font.

       faceSize3 (class FaceSize3)
               Specifies the pointsize of the third alternative font.

       faceSize4 (class FaceSize4)
               Specifies the pointsize of the fourth alternative font.

       faceSize5 (class FaceSize5)
               Specifies the pointsize of the fifth alternative font.

       faceSize6 (class FaceSize6)
               Specifies the pointsize of the sixth alternative font.

       font (class Font)
               Specifies the name of the normal font.  The default is “fixed”.

               See the discussion of the locale resource, which describes how this font may be overridden.

               NOTE: some resource files use patterns such as

                   *font: fixed

               which are overly broad, affecting both

                   xterm.vt100.font

               and

                   xterm.vt100.utf8Fonts.font

               which is probably not what you intended.

       fastScroll (class FastScroll)
               Modifies  the effect of jump scroll (jumpScroll) by suppressing screen refreshes for the special case
               when output to the screen has completely shifted the contents off-screen.  For  instance,  cat'ing  a
               large file to the screen does this.

       font1 (class Font1)
               Specifies the name of the first alternative font, corresponding to “Unreadable” in the standard menu.

       font2 (class Font2)
               Specifies the name of the second alternative font, corresponding to “Tiny” in the standard menu.

       font3 (class Font3)
               Specifies the name of the third alternative font, corresponding to “Small” in the standard menu.

       font4 (class Font4)
               Specifies the name of the fourth alternative font, corresponding to “Medium” in the standard menu.

       font5 (class Font5)
               Specifies the name of the fifth alternative font, corresponding to “Large” in the standard menu.

       font6 (class Font6)
               Specifies the name of the sixth alternative font, corresponding to “Huge” in the standard menu.

       fontDoublesize (class FontDoublesize)
               Specifies  whether  xterm  should  attempt to use font scaling to draw double-sized characters.  Some
               older font servers cannot do this properly, will return misleading  font  metrics.   The  default  is
               “true”.   If  disabled, xterm will simulate double-sized characters by drawing normal characters with
               spaces between them.

       fontWarnings (class FontWarnings)
               Specify whether xterm should report an error if it fails to load a font:

               0    Never report an error (though the X libraries may).

               1    Report an error if the font name was given as a resource setting.

               2    Always report an error on failure to load a font.

               The default is “1”.

       forceBoxChars (class ForceBoxChars)
               Specifies whether xterm should assume the normal and bold fonts have VT100 line-drawing characters:

               ·   The fixed-pitch ISO-8859-*-encoded fonts used by  xterm  normally  have  the  VT100  line-drawing
                   glyphs in cells 1-31.  Other fixed-pitch fonts may be more attractive, but lack these glyphs.

               ·   When  using an ISO-10646-1 font and the wideChars resource is true, xterm uses the Unicode glyphs
                   which match the VT100 line-drawing glyphs.

               If “false”, xterm checks for missing glyphs in the font and makes line-drawing characters directly as
               needed.   If  “true”,  xterm assumes the font does not contain the line-drawing characters, and draws
               them directly.  The default is “false”.

       forcePackedFont (class ForcePackedFont)
               Specifies whether xterm should use the maximum or minimum glyph width when displaying using a  bitmap
               font.   Use  the  maximum width to help with proportional fonts.  The default is “true”, denoting the
               minimum width.

       foreground (class Foreground)
               Specifies the color to use for displaying text in the window.  Setting the class name instead of  the
               instance  name  is an easy way to have everything that would normally appear in the text color change
               color.  The default is “XtDefaultForeground”.

       formatOtherKeys (class FormatOtherKeys)
               Overrides the format of the escape sequence used to report modified  keys  with  the  modifyOtherKeys
               resource.

               0  send modified keys as parameters for function-key 27 (default).

               1  send modified keys as parameters for CSI u.

       freeBoldBox (class FreeBoldBox)
               Specifies  whether  xterm  should assume the bounding boxes for normal and bold fonts are compatible.
               If “false”, xterm compares them and will reject choices of bold fonts that do not match the  size  of
               the normal font.  The default is “false”, which means that the comparison is performed.

       geometry (class Geometry)
               Specifies  the  preferred  size  and  position  of  the  VT102  window.  There is no default for this
               resource.

       highlightColor (class HighlightColor)
               Specifies the color to use for the background of  selected  (highlighted)  text.   If  not  specified
               (i.e.,  matching  the  default  foreground),  reverse  video is used.  The default is “XtDefaultFore‐
               ground”.

       highlightColorMode (class HighlightColorMode)
               Specifies whether xterm should use highlightTextColor and highlightColor  to  override  the  reversed
               foreground/background colors in a selection.  The default is unspecified: at startup, xterm checks if
               those resources are set to something other than the default foreground and background  colors.   Set‐
               ting this resource disables the check.

               The  following table shows the interaction of the highlighting resources, abbreviated as shown to fit
               in this page:

       highlightReverse (class HighlightReverse)
               Specifies whether xterm should reverse the selection foreground and background colors when  selecting
               text  with  reverse-video  attribute.  This applies only to the highlightColor and highlightTextColor
               resources, e.g., to match the color scheme of  xwsh.   If  “true”,  xterm  reverses  the  colors,  If
               “false”, xterm does not reverse colors, The default is “true”.

       highlightSelection (class HighlightSelection)
               If  “false”, selecting with the mouse highlights all positions on the screen between the beginning of
               the selection and the current position.  If “true”, xterm highlights only the positions that  contain
               text that can be selected.  The default is “false”.

               Depending  on  the way your applications write to the screen, there may be trailing blanks on a line.
               Xterm stores data as it is shown on the screen.  Erasing the display changes the  internal  state  of
               each  cell  so  it  is not considered a blank for the purpose of selection.  Blanks written since the
               last erase are selectable.  If you do not wish to have trailing blanks in a selection, use the trimS‐
               election resource.

       highlightTextColor (class HighlightTextColor)
               Specifies  the  color  to  use  for  the foreground of selected (highlighted) text.  If not specified
               (i.e., matching the default background), reverse video  is  used.   The  default  is  “XtDefaultBack‐
               ground”.

       hpLowerleftBugCompat (class HpLowerleftBugCompat)
               Specifies  whether  to work around a bug in HP's xdb, which ignores termcap and always sends ESC F to
               move to the lower left corner.  “true” causes xterm to interpret ESC F as a request to  move  to  the
               lower left corner of the screen.  The default is “false”.

       i18nSelections (class I18nSelections)
               If false, xterm will not request the targets COMPOUND_TEXT or TEXT.  The default is “true”. It may be
               set to false in order to work around ICCCM violations by other X clients.

       iconBorderColor (class BorderColor)
               Specifies the border color for the active icon window if this feature is compiled  into  xterm.   Not
               all window managers will make the icon border visible.

       iconBorderWidth (class BorderWidth)
               Specifies  the  border  width for the active icon window if this feature is compiled into xterm.  The
               default is “2”.  Not all window managers will make the border visible.

       iconFont (class IconFont)
               Specifies the font for the miniature active icon window, if this feature is compiled into xterm.  The
               default is “nil2”.

       initialFont (class InitialFont)
               Specifies  which  of  the  VT100  fonts to use initially.  Values are the same as for the set-vt-font
               action.  The default is “d”, i.e., “default”.

       inputMethod (class XtCInputMethod)
               Tells xterm which type of input method to use.  There is no default method.

       internalBorder (class BorderWidth)
               Specifies the number of pixels between the characters and the window border.  The default is “2”.

       italicULMode (class ColorAttrMode)
               Specifies whether characters with the underline attribute should be displayed in an italic font or as
               underlined characters.  It is implemented only for TrueType fonts.

       jumpScroll (class JumpScroll)
               Specifies  whether  or not jump scroll should be used.  This corresponds to the VT102 DECSCLM private
               mode.  The default is “true”.  See fastScroll for a variation.

       keepSelection (class KeepSelection)
               Specifies whether xterm will keep the selection even after the selected area was touched by some out‐
               put to the terminal.  The default is “true”.

       keyboardDialect (class KeyboardDialect)
               Specifies the initial keyboard dialect, as well as the default value when the terminal is reset.  The
               value given is the same as the final character in the control sequences which change character  sets.
               The default is “B”, which corresponds to US ASCII.

       nameKeymap (class NameKeymap)
               See the discussion of the keymap() action.

       limitResize (class LimitResize)
               Limits  resizing  of  the  screen via control sequence to a given multiple of the display dimensions.
               The default is “1”.

       locale (class Locale)
               Specifies how to use luit, an encoding converter between UTF-8 and locale  encodings.   The  resource
               value (ignoring case) may be:

               true
                   xterm  will  use the encoding specified by the users' LC_CTYPE locale (i.e., LC_ALL, LC_CTYPE, or
                   LANG variables) as far as possible.  This is realized by always enabling UTF-8 mode and  invoking
                   luit in non-UTF-8 locales.

               medium
                   xterm  will follow users' LC_CTYPE locale only for UTF-8, east Asian, and Thai locales, where the
                   encodings were not supported by conventional 8bit mode with changing fonts.  For  other  locales,
                   xterm will use conventional 8bit mode.

               checkfont
                   If  mini-luit  is  compiled-in, xterm will check if a Unicode font has been specified.  If so, it
                   checks if the character encoding for the current locale is POSIX, Latin-1 or  Latin-9,  uses  the
                   appropriate  mapping  to support those with the Unicode font.  For other encodings, xterm assumes
                   that UTF-8 encoding is required.

               false
                   xterm will use conventional 8bit mode or UTF-8 mode according to utf8 resource or -u8 option.

               Any other value, e.g., “UTF-8” or “ISO8859-2”, is assumed to  be  an  encoding  name;  luit  will  be
               invoked  to  support  the  encoding.   The  actual  list of supported encodings depends on luit.  The
               default is “medium”.

               Regardless of your locale and encoding, you need an ISO-10646-1 font to  display  the  result.   Your
               configuration  may  not include this font, or locale-support by xterm may not be needed.  At startup,
               xterm uses a mechanism equivalent to the load-vt-fonts(utf8Fonts, Utf8Fonts) action to load font name
               subresources of the VT100 widget.  That is, resource patterns such as “*vt100.utf8Fonts.font” will be
               loaded, and (if this resource is enabled), override the normal fonts.  If no subresources are  found,
               the  normal  fonts  such as “*vt100.font”, etc., are used.  The resource files distributed with xterm
               use ISO-10646-1 fonts, but do not rely on them unless you are using the locale mechanism.

       localeFilter (class LocaleFilter)
               Specifies the file name for the encoding converter from/to locale encodings and UTF-8 which  is  used
               with  the  -lc  option or locale resource.  The help message shown by “xterm -help” lists the default
               value, which depends on your system configuration.

               If the encoding converter requires command-line parameters, you can  add  those  after  the  command,
               e.g.,

                   *localeFilter: xterm-filter -p

               Alternatively,  you  may  put those parameter within a shell script to execute the converter, and set
               this resource to point to the shell script.

               When using a locale-filter, e.g., with the -e option, or the shell, xterm first tries passing control
               via  that  filter.   If  it fails, xterm will retry without the locale-filter.  Xterm warns about the
               failure before retrying.

       loginShell (class LoginShell)
               Specifies whether or not the shell to be run in the window should be started as a login  shell.   The
               default is “false”.

       marginBell (class MarginBell)
               Specifies  whether  or  not  the  bell should be rung when the user types near the right margin.  The
               default is “false”.

       metaSendsEscape (class MetaSendsEscape)
               If “true”, Meta characters (a character combined with the Meta modifier key)  are  converted  into  a
               two-character  sequence  with the character itself preceded by ESC.  This applies as well to function
               key control sequences, unless xterm sees that Meta is used in your  key  translations.   If  “false”,
               Meta  characters  input  from  the keyboard are handled according to the eightBitInput resource.  The
               default is “False”.

       mkSamplePass (class MkSamplePass)
               If mkSampleSize is nonzero, and mkWidth (and cjkWidth) are  false,  on  startup  xterm  compares  its
               built-in tables to the system's wide character width data to decide if it will use the system's data.
               It tests the first mkSampleSize character values, and allows up to mkSamplePass mismatches before the
               test fails.  The default (for the allowed number of mismatches) is 256.

       mkSampleSize (class MkSampleSize)
               With  mkSamplePass, this specifies a startup test used for initializing wide character width calcula‐
               tions.  The default (number of characters to check) is 1024.

       mkWidth (class MkWidth)
               Specifies whether xterm should use a built-in version of the wide character width  calculation.   See
               also the cjkWidth resource which can override this.  The default is “false”.

               Here is a summary of the resources which control the choice of wide character width calculation:

               cjkWidth   mkWidth   Action
               ───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
               false      false     use system tables subject to mkSamplePass
               false      true      use built-in tables
               true       false     use built-in CJK tables
               true       true      use built-in CJK tables

       modifyCursorKeys (class ModifyCursorKeys)
               Tells how to handle the special case where Control-, Shift-, Alt- or Meta-modifiers are used to add a
               parameter to the escape sequence returned by a cursor-key.  The default is “2”:

               -1   disables the feature.

               0    uses the old/obsolete behavior.

               1    prefixes modified sequences with CSI.

               2    forces the modifier to be the second parameter if it would otherwise be the first.

               3    marks the sequence with a “>” to hint that it is private.

       modifyFunctionKeys (class ModifyFunctionKeys)
               Tells how to handle the special case where Control-, Shift-, Alt- or Meta-modifiers are used to add a
               parameter  to  the  escape  sequence returned by a (numbered) function-key.  The default is “2”.  The
               resource values are similar to modifyCursorKeys:

               -1   permits the user to use shift- and control-modifiers to construct function-key strings using the
                    normal encoding scheme.

               0    uses the old/obsolete behavior.

               1    prefixes modified sequences with CSI.

               2    forces the modifier to be the second parameter if it would otherwise be the first.

               3    marks the sequence with a “>” to hint that it is private.

               If modifyFunctionKeys is zero, xterm uses Control- and Shift-modifiers to allow the user to construct
               numbered function-keys beyond the set provided by the keyboard:

               Control
                    adds the value given by the ctrlFKeys resource.

               Shift
                    adds twice the value given by the ctrlFKeys resource.

               Control/Shift
                    adds three times the value given by the ctrlFKeys resource.

       modifyKeyboard (class ModifyKeyboard)
               Normally xterm makes a special case regarding modifiers (shift, control,  etc.)   to  handle  special
               keyboard  layouts (legacy and vt220).  This is done to provide compatible keyboards for DEC VT220 and
               related terminals that implement user-defined keys (UDK).

               The bits of the resource value selectively enable modification of the given category when these  key‐
               boards are selected.  The default is “0”:

               0    The  legacy/vt220 keyboards interpret only the Control-modifier when constructing numbered func‐
                    tion-keys.  Other special keys are not modified.

               1    allows modification of the numeric keypad

               2    allows modification of the editing keypad

               4    allows modification of function-keys, overrides use of Shift-modifier for UDK.

               8    allows modification of other special keys

       modifyOtherKeys (class ModifyOtherKeys)
               Like modifyCursorKeys, tells xterm to construct an escape sequence for other keys (such as “2”)  when
               modified by Control-, Alt- or Meta-modifiers.  This feature does not apply to function keys and well-
               defined keys such as ESC or the control keys.  The default is “0”:

               0    disables this feature.

               1    enables this feature for keys except for those with well-known behavior,  e.g.,  Tab,  Backarrow
                    and some special control character cases, e.g., Control-Space to make a NUL.

               2    enables this feature for keys including the exceptions listed.

       multiClickTime (class MultiClickTime)
               Specifies  the  maximum time in milliseconds between multi-click select events.  The default is “250”
               milliseconds.

       multiScroll (class MultiScroll)
               Specifies whether or not scrolling should be done asynchronously.  The default is “false”.

       nMarginBell (class Column)
               Specifies the number of characters from the right margin at which the margin  bell  should  be  rung,
               when enabled by the marginBell resource.  The default is “10”.

       numLock (class NumLock)
               If  “true”,  xterm checks if NumLock is used as a modifier (see xmodmap(1)).  If so, this modifier is
               used to simplify the logic when implementing special NumLock  for  the  sunKeyboard  resource.   Also
               (when  sunKeyboard is false), similar logic is used to find the modifier associated with the left and
               right Alt keys.  The default is “true”.

       oldXtermFKeys (class OldXtermFKeys)
               If “true”, xterm will use old-style control sequences for function keys F1 to F4,  for  compatibility
               with  X  Consortium  xterm.  Otherwise, it uses the VT100-style codes for PF1 to PF4.  The default is
               “false”.

       on2Clicks (class On2Clicks)

       on3Clicks (class On3Clicks)

       on4Clicks (class On4Clicks)

       on5Clicks (class On5Clicks)
               Specify selection behavior in response to multiple mouse clicks.  A  single  mouse  click  is  always
               interpreted  as described in the SELECTION section (see POINTER USAGE).  Multiple mouse clicks (using
               the button which activates the select-start action) are interpreted according to the resource  values
               of on2Clicks, etc.  The resource value can be one of these:

               word
                  Select a “word” as determined by the charClass resource.  See the CHARACTER CLASSES section.

               line
                  Select a line (counting wrapping).

               group
                  Select  a  group  of adjacent lines (counting wrapping).  The selection stops on a blank line, and
                  does not extend outside the current page.

               page
                  Select all visible lines, i.e., the page.

               all
                  Select all lines, i.e., including the saved lines.

               regex
                  Select a “word” as determined by the regular expression which follows in the resource value.

               none
                  No selection action is associated with this resource.  xterm interprets it as the end of the list.
                  For  example,  you  may  use  it  to  disable triple (and higher) clicking by setting on3Clicks to
                  “none”.

               The default values for on2Clicks and on3Clicks are “word” and  “line”,  respectively.   There  is  no
               default  value  for  on4Clicks or on5Clicks, making those inactive.  On startup, xterm determines the
               maximum number of clicks by the onXClicks resource values which are set.

       openIm (class XtCOpenIm)
               Tells xterm whether to open the input method at startup.  The default is “true”.

       pointerColor (class PointerColor)
               Specifies the foreground color of the pointer.  The default is “XtDefaultForeground”.

       pointerColorBackground (class PointerColorBackground)
               Specifies the background color of the pointer.  The default is “XtDefaultBackground”.

       pointerMode (class PointerMode)
               Specifies when the pointer may be hidden as the user types.  It will be redisplayed if the user moves
               the mouse, or clicks one of its buttons.

               0  never

               1  the application running in xterm has not activated mouse mode.  This is the default.

               2  always.

       pointerShape (class Cursor)
               Specifies the name of the shape of the pointer.  The default is “xterm”.

       popOnBell (class PopOnBell)
               Specifies whether the window would be raised when Control-G is received.  The default is “false”.

               If  the  window  is iconified, this has no effect.  However, the zIconBeep resource provides you with
               the ability to see which iconified windows have sounded a bell.

       precompose (class XtCPrecompose)
               Tells xterm whether to precompose UTF-8 data into Normalization Form C, which combines  commonly-used
               accents  onto  base  characters.   If it does not do this, accents are left as separatate characters.
               The default is “true”.

       preeditType (class XtCPreeditType)
               Tells xterm which types of preedit (preconversion) string to  display.   The  default  is  “OverTheS‐
               pot,Root”.

       printAttributes (class PrintAttributes)
               Specifies  whether  to  print graphic attributes along with the text.  A real DEC VTxxx terminal will
               print the underline, highlighting codes but your printer may not handle these.

               ·   “0” disables the attributes.

               ·   “1” prints the normal set of attributes (bold, underline, inverse and blink) as VT100-style  con‐
                   trol sequences.

               ·   “2” prints ANSI color attributes as well.

               The default is “1”.

       printFileImmediate (PrintFileImmediate)
               When the print-immediate action is invoked, xterm prints the screen contents directly to a file.  Set
               this resource to the prefix of the filename (a timestamp will be appended to the actual name).

               The default is an empty string, i.e., “”, However, when the print-immediate action is invoked, if the
               string is empty, then “XTerm” is used.

       printFileOnXError (PrintFileOnXError)
               If  xterm  exits  with an X error, e.g., your connection is broken when the server crashes, it can be
               told to write the contents of the screen to a file.  To enable the feature, set this resource to  the
               prefix of the filename (a timestamp will be appended to the actual name).

               The  default  is an empty string, i.e., “”, which disables this feature.  However, when the print-on-
               error action is invoked, if the string is empty, then “XTermError” is used.

               These error codes are handled: ERROR_XERROR, ERROR_XIOERROR and ERROR_ICEERROR.

       printModeImmediate (PrintModeImmediate)
               When the print-immediate action is invoked, xterm prints the screen contents directly to a file.  You
               can  use  the printModeImmediate resource to tell it to use escape sequences to reconstruct the video
               attributes and colors.  This uses the same values as the printAttributes resource.   The  default  is
               “0”.

       printModeOnXError (PrintModeOnXError)
               Xterm  implements  the  printFileOnXError  feature  using the printer feature, although the output is
               written directly to a file.  You can use the printModeOnXError resource to  tell  it  to  use  escape
               sequences  to reconstruct the video attributes and colors.  This uses the same values as the printAt‐
               tributes resource.  The default is “0”.

       printOptsImmediate (PrintOptsImmediate)
               Specify the range of text which is printed to a file when the print-immediately action is invoked.

               ·   If zero (0), then this selects the current (visible screen) plus the saved lines, except  if  the
                   alternate screen is being used.  In that case, only the alternate screen is selectd.

               ·   If nonzero, the bits of this resource value (checked in descending order) select the range:

                   8  selects the saved lines.

                   4  selects the alternate screen.

                   2  selects the normal screen.

                   1  selects the current screen, which can be either the normal or alternate screen.

               The  default  is “9”, which selects the current visible screen plus saved lines, with no special case
               for the alternated screen.

       printOptsOnXError (PrintOptsOnXError)
               Specify the range of text which is printed to a file when the print-on-error action is invoked.   The
               resource value is interpreted the same as in printOptsImmediate.

               The  default  is “9”, which selects the current visible screen plus saved lines, with no special case
               for the alternated screen.

       printerAutoClose (class PrinterAutoClose)
               If “true”, xterm will close the printer (a pipe) when the application switches  the  printer  offline
               with a Media Copy command.  The default is “false”.

       printerCommand (class PrinterCommand)
               Specifies  a  shell command to which xterm will open a pipe when the first MC (Media Copy) command is
               initiated.  The default is an empty string, i.e., “”.  If the resource value is  given  as  an  empty
               string, the printer is disabled.

       printerControlMode (class PrinterControlMode)
               Specifies the printer control mode.  A “1” selects autoprint mode, which causes xterm to print a line
               from the screen when you move the cursor off that line with a line feed, form feed  or  vertical  tab
               character,  or  an autowrap occurs.  Autoprint mode is overridden by printer controller mode (a “2”),
               which causes all of the output to be directed to the printer.  The default is “0”.

       printerExtent (class PrinterExtent)
               Controls whether a print page function will print the entire page (true), or  only  the  the  portion
               within the scrolling margins (false).  The default is “false”.

       printerFormFeed (class PrinterFormFeed)
               Controls whether a form feed is sent to the printer at the end of a print page function.  The default
               is “false”.

       printerNewLine (class PrinterNewLine)
               Controls whether a newline is sent to the printer at the end of a print page function.   The  default
               is “true”.

       privateColorRegisters (class privateColorRegisters)
               If  true,  allocate  separate color registers for each sixel device control string, e.g., for DECGCI.
               If not true, color registers are allocated only once, when the terminal is  reset.   The  default  is
               “true”.

       quietGrab (class QuietGrab)
               Controls  whether  the  cursor is repainted when NotifyGrab and NotifyUngrab event types are received
               during change of focus.  The default is “false”.

       renderFont (class RenderFont)
               If xterm is built with the Xft library, this controls whether the faceName  resource  is  used.   The
               default is “default”.

               The resource values are strings, evaluated as booleans after startup.

               false
                    disable the feature and use the normal (bitmap) font.

               true
                    startup  using  the  TrueType font specified by the faceName and faceSize resource settings.  If
                    there is no value for faceName, disable the feature and use the normal (bitmap) font.

                    After startup, you can still switch to/from the bitmap font  using  the  “TrueType  Fonts”  menu
                    entry.

               default
                    startup using the normal (bitmap) font, but enable the “TrueType Fonts” menu entry to allow run‐
                    time switching to/from TrueType fonts.

                    If there is no faceName resource set, then runtime switching  to  TrueType  fonts  is  disabled.
                    Xterm  has  a  separate  compiled-in value for faceName for the special case where renderFont is
                    “default”.  That is normally “mono”.

       resizeGravity (class ResizeGravity)
               Affects the behavior when the window is resized to be taller or shorter.   NorthWest  specifies  that
               the top line of text on the screen stay fixed.  If the window is made shorter, lines are dropped from
               the bottom; if the window is made taller, blank lines are added at the bottom.   This  is  compatible
               with  the  behavior  in  R4.   SouthWest  (the default) specifies that the bottom line of text on the
               screen stay fixed.  If the window is made taller, additional saved lines will be scrolled  down  onto
               the  screen; if the window is made shorter, lines will be scrolled off the top of the screen, and the
               top saved lines will be dropped.

       retryInputMethod (class XtCRetryInputMethod)
               Tells xterm how many times to retry, in case the input-method server is not responding.   This  is  a
               different  issue  than unsupported preedit type, etc.  You may encounter retries if your X configura‐
               tion (and its libraries) are missing pieces.  Setting this resource to zero  ``0''  will  cancel  the
               retrying.  The default is ``3''.

       reverseVideo (class ReverseVideo)
               Specifies whether or not reverse video should be simulated.  The default is “false”.

               There are several aspects to reverse video in xterm:

               ·   The  command-line  -rv option tells the X libraries to reverse the foreground and background col‐
                   ors.  Xterm's command-line options set resource values.  In particular, the X  Toolkit  sets  the
                   reverseVideo resource when the -rv option is used.

               ·   If  the  user  has also used command-line options -fg or -bg to set the foreground and background
                   colors, xterm does not see these options directly.  Instead, it examines the resource  values  to
                   reconstruct  the  command-line  options, and determine which of the colors is the user's intended
                   foreground, etc.  Their actual values are irrelevant to the reverse video  function;  some  users
                   prefer  the  X  defaults  (black text on a white background), others prefer white text on a black
                   background.

               ·   After startup, the user can toggle the “Enable Reverse Video” menu  entry.   This  exchanges  the
                   current  foreground  and background colors of the VT100 widget, and repaints the screen.  Because
                   of the X resource hierarchy, the reverseVideo resource applies to more than the VT100 widget.

               Programs running in an xterm can also use control sequences to enable the VT100 reverse  video  mode.
               These  are  independent of the reverseVideo resource and the menu entry.  Xterm exchanges the current
               foreground and background colors when drawing text affected by these control sequences.

               Other control sequences can alter the foreground and background colors which are used:

               ·   Programs can also use the ANSI color control sequences to set the foreground and background  col‐
                   ors.

               ·   Extensions  to  the ANSI color controls (such as 16-, 88- or 256-colors) are treated similarly to
                   the ANSI control.

               ·   Using other control sequences (the “dynamic colors” feature), a program can change the foreground
                   and background colors.

       reverseWrap (class ReverseWrap)
               Specifies  whether  or not reverse-wraparound should be enabled.  This corresponds to xterm's private
               mode 45.  The default is “false”.

       rightScrollBar (class RightScrollBar)
               Specifies whether or not the scrollbar should be displayed on the right rather than  the  left.   The
               default is “false”.

       saveLines (class SaveLines)
               Specifies  the  number  of  lines to save beyond the top of the screen when a scrollbar is turned on.
               The default is “64”.

       scrollBar (class ScrollBar)
               Specifies whether or not the scrollbar should be displayed.  The default is “false”.

       scrollBarBorder (class ScrollBarBorder)
               Specifies the width of the scrollbar border.  Note that this is drawn to overlap the  border  of  the
               xterm  window.   Modifying  the scrollbar's border affects only the line between the VT100 widget and
               the scrollbar.  The default value is 1.

       scrollKey (class ScrollCond)
               Specifies whether or not pressing a key should automatically cause the scrollbar to go to the  bottom
               of the scrolling region.  This corresponds to xterm's private mode 1011.  The default is “false”.

       scrollLines (class ScrollLines)
               Specifies  the  number of lines that the scroll-back and scroll-forw actions should use as a default.
               The default value is 1.

       scrollTtyOutput (class ScrollCond)
               Specifies whether or not output to the terminal should automatically cause the scrollbar to go to the
               bottom of the scrolling region.  The default is “true”.

       selectToClipboard (class SelectToClipboard)
               Tells  xterm  whether  to  use the PRIMARY or CLIPBOARD for SELECT tokens in the selection mechanism.
               The set-select action can change this at runtime, allowing the user to work with programs that handle
               only one of these mechanisms.  The default is “false”, which tells it to use PRIMARY.

       shiftFonts (class ShiftFonts)
               Specifies  whether  to  enable the actions larger-vt-font() and smaller-vt-font(), which are normally
               bound to the shifted KP_Add and KP_Subtract.  The default is “true”.

       showBlinkAsBold (class ShowBlinkAsBold)
               Tells xterm whether to display text with blink-attribute the same as bold.  If  xterm  has  not  been
               configured  to  support  blinking text, the default is “true”, which corresponds to older versions of
               xterm, otherwise the default is “false”.

       showMissingGlyphs (class ShowMissingGlyphs)
               Tells xterm whether to display a box outlining places where a character has been used that  the  font
               does not represent.  The default is “false”.

       showWrapMarks (class ShowWrapMarks)
               For debugging xterm and applications that may manipulate the wrapped-line flag by writing text at the
               right margin, show a mark on the right inner-border of the window.  The mark shows which  lines  have
               the flag set.

       signalInhibit (class SignalInhibit)
               Specifies  whether  or not the entries in the “Main Options” menu for sending signals to xterm should
               be disallowed.  The default is “false”.

       sixelScrolling (class SixelScrolling)
               If true, graphics scroll up one line at a time when sixels would be written past the bottom  line  on
               the window.  The default is “false”.

       tekGeometry (class Geometry)
               Specifies  the  preferred  size  and  position of the Tektronix window.  There is no default for this
               resource.

       tekInhibit (class TekInhibit)
               Specifies whether or not the escape sequence to enter Tektronix mode should be ignored.  The  default
               is “false”.

       tekSmall (class TekSmall)
               Specifies  whether  or not the Tektronix mode window should start in its smallest size if no explicit
               geometry is given.  This is useful when running xterm on displays with small screens.  The default is
               “false”.

       tekStartup (class TekStartup)
               Specifies whether or not xterm should start up in Tektronix mode.  The default is “false”.

       tiXtraScroll (class TiXtraScroll)
               Specifies  whether  xterm should scroll to a new page when processing the ti termcap entry, i.e., the
               private modes 47, 1047 or 1049.  This is only in effect if titeInhibit is “true”, because the  intent
               of  this  option  is  to provide a picture of the full-screen application's display on the scrollback
               without wiping out the text that would be shown before the application was initialized.  The  default
               for this resource is “false”.

       titeInhibit (class TiteInhibit)
               Specifies whether or not xterm should remove ti and te termcap entries (used to switch between alter‐
               nate screens on startup of many screen-oriented programs) from the TERMCAP  string.   If  set,  xterm
               also  ignores  the  escape  sequence to switch to the alternate screen.  Xterm supports terminfo in a
               different way, supporting composite control sequences (also known as private modes)  1047,  1048  and
               1049  which  have the same effect as the original 47 control sequence.  The default for this resource
               is “false”.

       titleModes (class TitleModes)
               Tells xterm whether to accept or return window- and icon-labels in ISO-8859-1 (the default) or UTF-8.
               Either can be encoded in hexadecimal.  The default for this resource is “0”.

               Each  bit  (bit  “0” is 1, bit “1” is 2, etc.)  corresponds to one of the parameters set by the title
               modes control sequence:

               0    Set window/icon labels using hexadecimal

               1    Query window/icon labels using hexadecimal

               2    Set window/icon labels using UTF-8 (overrides utf8Title resource).

               3    Query window/icon labels using UTF-8

       translations (class Translations)
               Specifies the key and button bindings for menus, selections, “programmed strings”, etc.  The transla‐
               tions resource, which provides much of xterm's configurability, is a feature of the X Toolkit Intrin‐
               sics library (Xt).  See the ACTIONS section.

       trimSelection (class TrimSelection)
               If you set highlightSelection, you can see the text which is selected, including any trailing spaces.
               Clearing  the  screen  (or a line) resets it to a state containing no spaces.  Some lines may contain
               trailing spaces when an application writes them to the screen.  However, you may not  wish  to  paste
               lines  with  trailing  spaces.   If  this resource is true, xterm will trim trailing spaces from text
               which is selected.  It does not affect spaces which result in a wrapped line, nor will  it  trim  the
               trailing newline from your selection.  The default is “false”.

       underLine (class UnderLine)
               This  specifies  whether  or  not  text with the underline attribute should be underlined.  It may be
               desirable to disable underlining when color is being used for the underline attribute.   The  default
               is “true”.

       useClipping (class UseClipping)
               Tell xterm whether to use clipping to keep from producing dots outside the text drawing area.  Origi‐
               nally used to work around for overstriking effects, this is also needed  to  work  with  some  incor‐
               rectly-sized fonts.  The default is “true”.

       utf8 (class Utf8)
               This  specifies  whether xterm will run in UTF-8 mode.  If you set this resource, xterm also sets the
               wideChars resource as a side-effect.  The resource can be set via the menu  entry  “UTF-8  Encoding”.
               The default is “default”.

               Xterm accepts either a keyword (ignoring case) or the number shown in parentheses:

               false (0)
                  UTF-8 mode is initially off.  The command-line option +u8 sets the resource to this value.  Escape
                  sequences for turning UTF-8 mode on/off are allowed.

               true (1)
                  UTF-8 mode is initially on.  Escape sequences for turning UTF-8 mode on/off are allowed.

               always (2)
                  The command-line option -u8 sets the resource to this value.  Escape sequences for  turning  UTF-8
                  mode on/off are ignored.

               default (3)
                  This  is  the  default  value  of  the resource.  It is changed during initialization depending on
                  whether the locale resource was set, to false (0) or always (2).   See  the  locale  resource  for
                  additional discussion of non-UTF-8 locales.

               If  you  want to set the value of utf8, it should be in this range.  Other nonzero values are treated
               the same as “1”, i.e., UTF-8 mode is initially on, and escape sequences for turning UTF-8 mode on/off
               are allowed.

       utf8Fonts (class Utf8Fonts)
               See  the discussion of the locale resource.  This specifies whether xterm will use UTF-8 fonts speci‐
               fied via resource patterns such as “*vt100.utf8Fonts.font” or normal (ISO-8859-1) fonts via  patterns
               such  as  “*vt100.font”.   The  resource can be set via the menu entry “UTF-8 Fonts”.  The default is
               “default”.

               Xterm accepts either a keyword (ignoring case) or the number shown in parentheses:

               false (0)
                      Use the ISO-8859-1 fonts.  The menu entry is enabled, allowing  the  choice  of  fonts  to  be
                      changed at runtime.

               true (1)
                      Use the UTF-8 fonts.  The menu entry is enabled, allowing the choice of fonts to be changed at
                      runtime.

               always (2)
                      Always use the UTF-8 fonts.  This also disables the menu entry.

               default (3)
                      At startup, the resource is set to true or false, according to the effective value of the utf8
                      resource.

       utf8Latin1 (class Utf8Latin1)
               If true, allow an ISO-8859-1 normal font to be combined with an ISO-10646 font if the latter is given
               via the -fw option or its corresponding resource value.  The default is “false”.

       utf8SelectTypes (class Utf8SelectTypes)
               Override xterm's default selection target list (see SELECT/PASTE) for  selections  in  wide-character
               (UTF-8) mode.  The default is an empty string, i.e., “”, which does not override anything.

       utf8Title (class Utf8Title)
               Applications  can  set  xterm's  title by writing a control sequence.  Normally this control sequence
               follows the VT220 convention, which encodes the string in ISO-8859-1 and allows for an  8-bit  string
               terminator.   If  xterm is started in a UTF-8 locale, it translates the ISO-8859-1 string to UTF-8 to
               work with the X libraries which assume the string is UTF-8.

               However, some users may wish to write a title string encoded in UTF-8.  The window manager is respon‐
               sible  for  drawing  window  titles.  Some window managers (not all) support UTF-8 encoding of window
               titles.  Set this resource to “true” to allow UTF-8 encoded title strings.  That cancels the transla‐
               tion to UTF-8, allowing UTF-8 strings to be displayed as is.

               This feature is available as a menu entry, since it is related to the particular applications you are
               running within xterm.  You can also use a control sequence (see the discussion of  “Title  Modes”  in
               the  control  sequences  document), to set an equivalent flag.  The titleModes resource sets the same
               value, which overrides this resource.

               The default is “false”.

       veryBoldColors (class VeryBoldColors)
               Specifies whether to combine video attributes with colors specified by colorBD, colorBL, colorRV  and
               colorUL.  The resource value is the sum of values for each attribute:
                 1 for reverse,
                 2 for underline,
                 4 for bold and
                 8 for blink.

               The default is “0”.

       visualBell (class VisualBell)
               Specifies  whether  or  not a visible bell (i.e., flashing) should be used instead of an audible bell
               when Control-G is received.  The default is “false”, which tells xterm to use an audible bell.

       visualBellDelay (class VisualBellDelay)
               Number of milliseconds to delay when displaying a visual bell.  Default is 100.  If set to  zero,  no
               visual bell is displayed.  This is useful for very slow displays, e.g., an LCD display on a laptop.

       visualBellLine (class VisualBellLine)
               Specifies whether to flash only the current line when displaying a visual bell.  rather than flashing
               the entire screen: The default is “false”, which tells xterm to flash the entire screen.

       vt100Graphics (class VT100Graphics)
               This specifies whether xterm will interpret VT100 graphic character escape sequences while  in  UTF-8
               mode.  The default is “true”, to provide support for various legacy applications.

       wideBoldFont (class WideBoldFont)
               This option specifies the font to be used for displaying bold wide text.  By default, it will attempt
               to use a font twice as wide as the font that will be used to draw bold text.  If no double-width font
               is found, it will improvise, by stretching the bold font.

       wideChars (class WideChars)
               Specifies  if  xterm should respond to control sequences that process 16-bit characters.  The default
               is “false”.

       wideFont (class WideFont)
               This option specifies the font to be used for displaying wide text.  By default, it will  attempt  to
               use  a font twice as wide as the font that will be used to draw normal text.  If no double-width font
               is found, it will improvise, by stretching the normal font.

       ximFont (class XimFont)
               This option specifies the font to be used for displaying the  preedit  string  in  the  “OverTheSpot”
               input method.

               In “OverTheSpot” preedit type, the preedit (preconversion) string is displayed at the position of the
               cursor.  It is the XIM server's responsibility to display the preedit string.  The  XIM  client  must
               inform the XIM server of the cursor position.  For best results, the preedit string must be displayed
               with a proper font.  Therefore, xterm informs the XIM server of the proper font.  The font is be sup‐
               plied  by  a "fontset", whose default value is “*”.  This matches every font, the X library automati‐
               cally chooses fonts with proper charsets.  The ximFont resource is provided to override this  default
               font setting.

               Specifies what character(s) should follow a GIN report  or  status  report.   The  possibilities  are
               “none”,  which  sends  no terminating characters, “CRonly”, which sends CR, and “CR&EOT”, which sends
               both CR and EOT.  The default is “none”.

   Scrollbar Resources
       The following resources are useful when specified for the Athena Scrollbar widget:

       thickness (class Thickness)
               Specifies the width in pixels of the scrollbar.

       background (class Background)
               Specifies the color to use for the background of the scrollbar.

       foreground (class Foreground)
               Specifies the color to use for the foreground of the scrollbar.  The “thumb” of the  scrollbar  is  a
               simple checkerboard pattern alternating pixels for foreground and background color.

POINTER USAGE
       Once  the  VT102 window is created, xterm allows you to select text and copy it within the same or other win‐
       dows.

   SELECTION
       The selection functions are invoked when the pointer buttons are used with no modifiers, and  when  they  are
       used  with  the  “shift”  key.   The  assignment  of the functions described below to keys and buttons may be
       changed through the resource database; see ACTIONS below.

       Pointer button one (usually left) is used to save text into the cut buffer.  Move the cursor to beginning  of
       the  text,  and  then hold the button down while moving the cursor to the end of the region and releasing the
       button.  The selected text is highlighted and is saved in the global cut buffer and made the  PRIMARY  selec‐
       tion when the button is released.  Normally (but see the discussion of on2Clicks, etc):

       ·   Double-clicking selects by words.

       ·   Triple-clicking selects by lines.

       ·   Quadruple-clicking goes back to characters, etc.

       Multiple-click  is determined by the time from button up to button down, so you can change the selection unit
       in the middle of a selection.  Logical words and lines selected by double- or triple-clicking may wrap across
       more than one screen line if lines were wrapped by xterm itself rather than by the application running in the
       window.  If the key/button bindings specify that an X selection is to be made, xterm will leave the  selected
       text highlighted for as long as it is the selection owner.

       Pointer  button  two (usually middle) “types” (pastes) the text from the PRIMARY selection, if any, otherwise
       from the cut buffer, inserting it as keyboard input.

       Pointer button three (usually right) extends the current selection.  (Without loss  of  generality,  you  can
       swap “right” and “left” everywhere in the rest of this paragraph.)  If pressed while closer to the right edge
       of the selection than the left, it extends/contracts the right edge of the selection.  If  you  contract  the
       selection  past  the  left  edge of the selection, xterm assumes you really meant the left edge, restores the
       original selection, then extends/contracts the left edge of the selection.  Extension starts in the selection
       unit  mode  that  the  last  selection or extension was performed in; you can multiple-click to cycle through
       them.

       By cutting and pasting pieces of text without trailing new lines, you can take text from  several  places  in
       different  windows  and form a command to the shell, for example, or take output from a program and insert it
       into your favorite editor.  Since cut buffers are globally  shared  among  different  applications,  you  may
       regard  each  as  a  “file” whose contents you know.  The terminal emulator and other text programs should be
       treating it as if it were a text file, i.e., the text is delimited by new lines.

   SCROLLING
       The scroll region displays the position and amount of text currently showing in the window (highlighted) rel‐
       ative to the amount of text actually saved.  As more text is saved (up to the maximum), the size of the high‐
       lighted area decreases.

       Clicking button one with the pointer in the scroll region moves the adjacent line to the top of  the  display
       window.

       Clicking button three moves the top line of the display window down to the pointer position.

       Clicking button two moves the display to a position in the saved text that corresponds to the pointer's posi‐
       tion in the scrollbar.

   TEKTRONIX POINTER
       Unlike the VT102 window, the Tektronix window does not allow the copying of text.  It  does  allow  Tektronix
       GIN  mode, and in this mode the cursor will change from an arrow to a cross.  Pressing any key will send that
       key and the current coordinate of the cross cursor.  Pressing button one, two, or three will return the  let‐
       ters  “l”,  “m”,  and “r”, respectively.  If the “shift” key is pressed when a pointer button is pressed, the
       corresponding upper case letter is sent.  To distinguish a pointer button from a key, the  high  bit  of  the
       character  is  set  (but  this  is  bit  is normally stripped unless the terminal mode is RAW; see tty(4) for
       details).

SELECT/PASTE
       X clients provide select and paste support by responding to requests conveyed by the server.

   PRIMARY
       When configured to use the primary selection, (the default) xterm can provide  the  selection  data  in  ways
       which help to retain character encoding information as it is pasted.

       A  user  “selects” text on xterm, which highlights the selected text.  A subsequent “paste” to another client
       forwards a request to the client owning the selection.  If xterm owns the primary  selection,  it  makes  the
       data  available  in  the  form of one or more “selection targets”.  If it does not own the primary selection,
       e.g., if it has released it or another client has asserted ownership, it relies on cut-buffers  to  pass  the
       data.  But cut-buffers handle only ISO-8859-1 data (officially - some clients ignore the rules).

   CLIPBOARD
       When configured to use the clipboard (see resource selectToClipboard), the problem with persistence of owner‐
       ship is bypassed.  Otherwise, there is no difference regarding the data which can be passed via selection.

   SELECTION TARGETS
       The different types of data which are passed depend on what the receiving client asks for.  These are  termed
       selection targets.

       When asking for the selection data, xterm tries the following types in this order:

              UTF8_STRING
                   This  is  an  XFree86  extension, which denotes that the data is encoded in UTF-8.  When xterm is
                   built with wide-character support, it both accepts and provides this type.

              TEXT the text is in the encoding which corresponds to your current locale.

              COMPOUND_TEXT
                   this is a format for multiple character set data, such as multi-lingual text.  It can store UTF-8
                   data as a special case.

              STRING
                   This is Latin 1 (ISO-8859-1) data.

       The middle two (TEXT and COMPOUND_TEXT) are added if xterm is configured with the i18nSelections resource set
       to “true”.

       UTF8_STRING is preferred (therefore first in the list) since xterm stores text as Unicode data  when  running
       in  wide-character mode, and no translation is needed.  On the other hand, TEXT and COMPOUND_TEXT may require
       translation.  If the translation is incomplete, they will insert X's “defaultString” whose  value  cannot  be
       set,  and  may  simply  be  empty.  Xterm's defaultString resource specifies the string to use for incomplete
       translations of the UTF8_STRING.

       You can alter the types which xterm tries using the eightBitSelectTypes or  utf8SelectTypes  resources.   For
       instance,  you might have some specific locale setting which does not use UTF-8 encoding.  The resource value
       is a comma-separated list of the selection targets, which consist of the names shown.  You can use  the  spe‐
       cial  name  I18N  to denote the optional inclusion of TEXT and COMPOUND_TEXT.  The names are matched ignoring
       case, and can be abbreviated.  The default list can be expressed in several ways, e.g.,

              UTF8_STRING,I18N,STRING
              utf8,i18n,string
              u,i,s

MENUS
       Xterm has four menus, named mainMenu, vtMenu, fontMenu, and tekMenu.  Each menu pops  up  under  the  correct
       combinations  of key and button presses.  Each menu is divided into sections, separated by a horizontal line.
       Some menu entries correspond to modes that can be altered.  A check mark appears next to a mode that is  cur‐
       rently  active.   Selecting one of these modes toggles its state.  Other menu entries are commands; selecting
       one of these performs the indicated function.

       All of the menu entries correspond to X actions.  In the list below, the menu label is shown followed by  the
       action's name in parenthesis.

   Main Options
       The  xterm mainMenu pops up when the “control” key and pointer button one are pressed in a window.  This menu
       contains items that apply to both the VT102 and Tektronix windows.  There are several sections:

       Commands for managing X events:

              Toolbar
                     Clicking on the “Toolbar” menu entry hides the toolbar if it is visible, and shows it if it  is
                     not.

              Secure Keyboard (securekbd)
                     The  Secure  Keyboard  mode  is  helpful when typing in passwords or other sensitive data in an
                     unsecure environment; see SECURITY below (but read the limitations carefully).

              Allow SendEvents (allowsends)
                     Specifies whether or not synthetic key and button events generated using the X protocol  SendE‐
                     vent  request  should  be  interpreted  or  discarded.  This corresponds to the allowSendEvents
                     resource.

              Redraw Window (redraw)
                     Forces the X display to repaint; useful in some environments.

       Commands for capturing output:

              Log to File (logging)
                     Captures text sent to the screen in a logfile, as in the -l logging option.

              Print-All Immediately
                     Invokes the print-immediate action, sending the text of the current window directly to a  file,
                     as specified by the printFileImmediate, printModeImmediate and printOptsImmediate resources.

              Print-All on Error
                     Invokes  the print-on-error action, which toggles a flag telling xterm that if it exits with an
                     X error, to send the text of the current window directly to a file, as specified by the  print‐
                     FileXError, printModeXError and printOptsXError resources.

              Print Window (print)
                     Sends the text of the current window to the program given in the printerCommand resource.

              Redirect to Printer (print-redir)
                     This  sets  the printerControlMode to 0 or 2.  You can use this to turn the printer on as if an
                     application had sent the appropriate control sequence.  It is also  useful  for  switching  the
                     printer off if an application turns it on without resetting the print control mode.

       Modes for setting keyboard style:

              8-Bit Controls (8-bit-control)
                     Enabled  for  VT220  emulation,  this  controls whether xterm will send 8-bit control sequences
                     rather than using 7-bit (ASCII) controls, e.g., sending a byte in the range 128-159 rather than
                     the  escape  character followed by a second byte.  Xterm always interprets both 8-bit and 7-bit
                     control sequences (see the document Xterm Control Sequences).  This corresponds to  the  eight‐
                     BitControl resource.

              Backarrow Key (BS/DEL) (backarrow key)
                     Modifies the behavior of the backarrow key, making it transmit either a backspace (8) or delete
                     (127) character.  This corresponds to the backarrowKey resource.

              Alt/NumLock Modifiers (num-lock)
                     Controls the treatment of Alt- and NumLock-key modifiers.   This  corresponds  to  the  numLock
                     resource.

              Meta Sends Escape (meta-esc)
                     Controls  whether  Meta  keys  are  converted  into a two-character sequence with the character
                     itself preceded by ESC.  This corresponds to the metaSendsEscape resource.

              Delete is DEL (delete-is-del)
                     Controls whether the Delete key on the editing keypad should send DEL (127) or the  VT220-style
                     Remove escape sequence.  This corresponds to the deleteIsDEL resource.

              Old Function-Keys (oldFunctionKeys)

              HP Function-Keys (hpFunctionKeys)

              SCO Function-Keys (scoFunctionKeys)

              Sun Function-Keys (sunFunctionKeys)

              VT220 Keyboard (sunKeyboard)
                     These  act  as  a radio-button, selecting one style for the keyboard layout.  It corresponds to
                     more than one resource setting: sunKeyboard, sunFunctionKeys, scoFunctionKeys  and  hpFunction‐
                     Keys ."

       Commands for process signalling:

              Send STOP Signal (suspend)

              Send CONT Signal (continue)

              Send INT Signal (interrupt)

              Send HUP Signal (hangup)

              Send TERM Signal (terminate)

              Send KILL Signal (kill)
                     These  send  the SIGTSTP, SIGCONT, SIGINT, SIGHUP, SIGTERM and SIGKILL signals respectively, to
                     the process group of the process running under xterm (usually the shell).  The SIGCONT function
                     is especially useful if the user has accidentally typed CTRL-Z, suspending the process.

              Quit (quit)
                     Stop  processing  X events except to support the -hold option, and then send a SIGHUP signal to
                     the the process group of the process running under xterm (usually the shell).

   VT Options
       The vtMenu sets various modes in the VT102 emulation, and is popped up when the  “control”  key  and  pointer
       button two are pressed in the VT102 window.

       VT102/VT220 Modes:

              Enable Scrollbar (scrollbar)
                     Enable  (or  disable)  the  scrollbar.   This  corresponds  to the -sb option and the scrollBar
                     resource.

              Enable Jump Scroll (jumpscroll)
                     Enable (or disable) jump scrolling.  This corresponds to  the  -j  option  and  the  jumpScroll
                     resource.

              Enable Reverse Video (reversevideo)
                     Enable  (or  disable)  reverse-video.   This corresponds to the -rv option and the reverseVideo
                     resource.

              Enable Auto Wraparound (autowrap)
                     Enable (or disable) auto-wraparound.  This corresponds to  the  -aw  option  and  the  autoWrap
                     resource.

              Enable Reverse Wraparound (reversewrap)
                     Enable (or disable) reverse wraparound.  This corresponds to the -rw option and the reverseWrap
                     resource.

              Enable Auto Linefeed (autolinefeed)
                     Enable (or disable) auto-linefeed.  This is the VT102 NEL function, which causes  the  emulator
                     to  emit  a linefeed after each carriage return.  There is no corresponding command-line option
                     or resource setting.

              Enable Application Cursor Keys (appcursor)
                     Enable (or  disable)  application  cursor  keys.   This  corresponds  to  the  appcursorDefault
                     resource.  There is no corresponding command-line option.

              Enable Application Keypad (appkeypad)
                     Enable  (or  disable)  application  keypad  keys.   This  corresponds  to  the appkeypadDefault
                     resource.  There is no corresponding command-line option.

              Scroll to Bottom on Key Press (scrollkey)
                     Enable (or disable) scrolling to the bottom of the scrolling region on a keypress.  This corre‐
                     sponds to the -sk option and the scrollKey resource.

                     As a special case, the XON / XOFF keys (control/S and control/Q) are ignored.

              Scroll to Bottom on Tty Output (scrollttyoutput)
                     Enable  (or disable) scrolling to the bottom of the scrolling region on output to the terminal.
                     This corresponds to the -si option and the scrollTtyOutput resource.

              Allow 80/132 Column Switching (allow132)
                     Enable (or disable) switching between 80 and 132 columns.  This corresponds to the -132  option
                     and the c132 resource.

              Keep Selection (keepSelection)
                     Tell  xterm whether to disown the selection when it stops highlighting it, e.g., when an appli‐
                     cation modifies the display so that it no longer matches the text which has  been  highlighted.
                     As long as xterm continues to own the selection, it can provide the corresponding text to other
                     clients via cut/paste.  This corresponds to the keepSelection resource.   There  is  no  corre‐
                     sponding command-line option.

              Select to Clipboard (selectToClipboard)
                     Tell  xterm  whether  to  use  the  PRIMARY  or CLIPBOARD for SELECT tokens in the translations
                     resource which maps keyboard and mouse actions to select/paste actions.   This  corresponds  to
                     the selectToClipboard resource.  There is no corresponding command-line option.

              Enable Visual Bell (visualbell)
                     Enable (or disable) visible bell (i.e., flashing) instead of an audible bell.  This corresponds
                     to the -vb option and the visualBell resource.

              Enable Bell Urgency (bellIsUrgent)
                     Enable (or disable) Urgency window manager hint when Control-G is received.   This  corresponds
                     to the bellIsUrgent resource.

              Enable Pop on Bell (poponbell)
                     Enable  (or disable) raising of the window when Control-G is received.  This corresponds to the
                     -pop option and the popOnBell resource.

              Enable Blinking Cursor (cursorblink)
                     Enable (or disable) the blinking-cursor feature.  This corresponds to the -bc  option  and  the
                     cursorBlink  resource.   There  is  also  an  escape  sequence  (see the document Xterm Control
                     Sequences).  The menu entry and the escape sequence states are XOR'd: if both are enabled,  the
                     cursor will not blink, if only one is enabled, the cursor will blink.

              Enable Alternate Screen Switching (titeInhibit)
                     Enable  (or  disable)  switching between the normal and alternate screens.  This corresponds to
                     the titeInhibit resource.  There is no corresponding command-line option.

              Enable Active Icon (activeicon)
                     Enable (or disable) the active-icon feature.  This  corresponds  to  the  -ai  option  and  the
                     activeIcon resource.

              Sixel Scrolling (sixelScrolling)
                     When  enabled,  sixel  graphics  are positioned at the current text cursor location, scroll the
                     image vertically if larger than the screen, and leave the text  cursor  after  the  image  when
                     returning  to text mode.  When disabled, sixel graphics are positioned at the upper left of the
                     screen, are cropped to fit the screen, and do not affect the text cursor location (this is  the
                     default).  This corresponds to the sixelScrolling resource.  There is no corresponding command-
                     line option.

              Private Color Registers (privateColorRegisters)
                     When enabled, each graphic image uses a separate set of color registers, so that it essentially
                     has  a  private  palette  (this is the default).  If it is not set, all graphics images share a
                     common set of registers which is how sixel and ReGIS graphics worked on actual  hardware.   The
                     default  is  likely  a  more useful mode on modern TrueColor hardware.  This corresponds to the
                     privateColorRegisters resource.  There is no corresponding command-line option.

       VT102/VT220 Commands:

              Do Soft Reset (softreset)
                     Reset scroll regions.  This can be convenient when some program has left the scroll regions set
                     incorrectly  (often a problem when using VMS or TOPS-20).  This corresponds to the VT220 DECSTR
                     control sequence.

              Do Full Reset (hardreset)
                     The full reset entry will clear the screen, reset tabs to every eight columns,  and  reset  the
                     terminal  modes  (such  as wrap and smooth scroll) to their initial states just after xterm has
                     finished processing the command line options.   This  corresponds  to  the  VT102  RIS  control
                     sequence,  with  a few obvious differences.  For example, your session is not disconnected as a
                     real VT102 would do.

              Reset and Clear Saved Lines (clearsavedlines)
                     Perform a full reset, and also clear the saved lines.

       Commands for setting the current screen:

              Show Tek Window (tekshow)
                     When enabled, pops the Tektronix 4014 window up (makes it visible).  When disabled,  hides  the
                     Tektronix 4014 window.

              Switch to Tek Mode (tekmode)
                     When  enabled, pops the Tektronix 4014 window up if it is not already visible, and switches the
                     input stream to that window.  When disabled, hides the Tektronix 4014 window and switches input
                     back to the VTxxx window.

              Hide VT Window (vthide)
                     When  enabled,  hides  the  VTxxx window, shows the Tektronix 4014 window if it was not already
                     visible and switches the input stream to that window.  When disabled, shows the  VTxxx  window,
                     and switches the input stream to that window.

              Show Alternate Screen (altscreen)
                     When  enabled,  shows the alternate screen.  When disabled, shows the normal screen.  Note that
                     the normal screen may have saved lines; the alternate screen does not.

   VT Fonts
       The fontMenu pops up when when the “control” key and pointer button three are pressed in a window.   It  sets
       the font used in the VT102 window, or modifies the way the font is specified or displayed.  There are several
       sections.

       The first section allows you to select the font from a set of alternatives:

              Default (fontdefault)
                     Set the font to the default, i.e., that given by the *VT100.font resource.

              Unreadable (font1)
                     Set the font to that given by the *VT100.font1 resource.

              Tiny (font2)
                     Set the font to that given by the *VT100.font2 resource.

              Small (font3)
                     Set the font to that given by the *VT100.font3 resource.

              Medium (font4)
                     Set the font to that given by the *VT100.font4 resource.

              Large (font5)
                     Set the font to that given by the *VT100.font5 resource.

              Huge (font6)
                     Set the font to that given by the *VT100.font6 resource.

              Escape Sequence
                     This allows you to set the font last specified by the Set Font escape sequence (see  the  docu‐
                     ment Xterm Control Sequences).

              Selection (fontsel)
                     This  allows you to set the font specified the current selection as a font name (if the PRIMARY
                     selection is owned).

       The second section allows you to modify the way it is displayed:

              Bold Fonts
                     This is normally checked (enabled).  When unchecked, xterm will not use bold fonts.   The  set‐
                     ting corresponds to the allowBoldFonts resource.

              Line-Drawing Characters (font-linedrawing)
                     When set, tells xterm to draw its own line-drawing characters.  Otherwise it relies on the font
                     containing these.  Compare to the forceBoxChars resource.

              Packed Font (font-packed)
                     When set, tells xterm to use the minimum glyph-width from a font  when  displaying  characters.
                     Use  the  maximum  width  (unchecked)  to help display proportional fonts.  Compare to the for‐
                     cePackedFont resource.

              Doublesized Characters (font-doublesize)
                     When set, xterm may ask the font server to produce scaled versions  of  the  normal  font,  for
                     VT102 double-size characters.

       The third section allows you to modify the way it is specified:

              TrueType Fonts (render-font)
                     If the renderFont and corresponding resources were set, this is a further control whether xterm
                     will actually use the Xft library calls to obtain a font.

              UTF-8 Encoding (utf8-mode)
                     This controls whether xterm uses UTF-8 encoding of input/output.  It is useful for  temporarily
                     switching  xterm to display text from an application which does not follow the locale settings.
                     It corresponds to the utf8 resource.

              UTF-8 Fonts (utf8-fonts)
                     This controls whether xterm uses UTF-8 fonts for display.  It is useful for temporarily switch‐
                     ing  xterm  to  display text from an application which does not follow the locale settings.  It
                     combines the utf8 and utf8Fonts resources.

              UTF-8 Titles (utf8-titles)
                     This controls whether xterm accepts UTF-8 encoding for title control sequences.  It corresponds
                     to the utf8Fonts resource.

                     Initially  the  checkmark  is set according to both the utf8 and utf8Fonts resource values.  If
                     the latter is set to “always”, the checkmark is disabled.  Likewise,  if  there  are  no  fonts
                     given in the utf8Fonts subresources, then the checkmark also is disabled.

                     The  standard XTerm app-defaults file defines both sets of fonts, while the UXTerm app-defaults
                     file defines only one set.  assuming the standard app-defaults files, this command will  launch
                     xterm able to switch between UTF-8 and ISO-8859-1 encoded fonts:

                         uxterm -class XTerm

              The fourth section allows you to enable or disable special operations which can be controlled by writ‐
              ing escape sequences to the terminal.  These are disabled if the SendEvents feature is enabled:

              Allow Color Ops (allow-font-ops)
                     This corresponds to the allowColorOps resource.   Enable  or  disable  control  sequences  that
                     set/query the colors.

              Allow Font Ops (allow-font-ops)
                     This  corresponds  to  the  allowFontOps  resource.   Enable  or disable control sequences that
                     set/query the font.

              Allow Tcap Ops (allow-tcap-ops)
                     Enable or disable control sequences that  query  the  terminal's  notion  of  its  function-key
                     strings, as termcap or terminfo capabilities.  This corresponds to the allowTcapOps resource.

              Allow Title Ops (allow-title-ops)
                     Enable  or  disable  control  sequences that modify the window title or icon name.  This corre‐
                     sponds to the allowTitleOps resource.

              Allow Window Ops (allow-window-ops)
                     Enable or disable extended window control sequences (as used in dtterm).  This  corresponds  to
                     the allowWindowOps resource.

   TEK Options
       The  tekMenu  sets  various  modes  in  the  Tektronix emulation, and is popped up when the “control” key and
       pointer button two are pressed in the Tektronix window.  The current font size is checked in the  modes  sec‐
       tion of the menu.

              Large Characters (tektextlarge)

              #2 Size Characters (tektext2)

              #3 Size Characters (tektext3)

              Small Characters (tektextsmall)

       Commands:

              PAGE (tekpage)
                     Clear the Tektronix window.

              RESET (tekreset)

              COPY (tekcopy)

       Windows:

              Show VT Window (vtshow)

              Switch to VT Mode (vtmode)

              Hide Tek Window (tekhide)

SECURITY
       X environments differ in their security consciousness.

       ·   Most  servers, run under xdm, are capable of using a “magic cookie” authorization scheme that can provide
           a reasonable level of security for many people.  If your server is only using a host-based  mechanism  to
           control  access  to  the  server (see xhost(1)), then if you enable access for a host and other users are
           also permitted to run clients on that same host, it is possible that someone can run an application which
           uses the basic services of the X protocol to snoop on your activities, potentially capturing a transcript
           of everything you type at the keyboard.

       ·   Any process which has access to your X display can manipulate it in ways that you might  not  anticipate,
           even  redirecting your keyboard to itself and sending events to your application's windows.  This is true
           even with the “magic cookie” authorization scheme.  While the allowSendEvents  provides  some  protection
           against rogue applications tampering with your programs, guarding against a snooper is harder.

       ·   The  X input extension for instance allows an application to bypass all of the other (limited) authoriza‐
           tion and security features, including the GrabKeyboard protocol.

       ·   The possibility of an application spying on your keystrokes is of particular concern  when  you  want  to
           type  in a password or other sensitive data.  The best solution to this problem is to use a better autho‐
           rization mechanism than is provided by X.

       Subject to all of these caveats, a simple mechanism exists for protecting keyboard input in xterm.

       The xterm menu (see MENUS above) contains a Secure Keyboard entry which, when  enabled,  attempts  to  ensure
       that  all keyboard input is directed only to xterm (using the GrabKeyboard protocol request).  When an appli‐
       cation prompts you for a password (or other sensitive data), you can enable Secure Keyboard using  the  menu,
       type in the data, and then disable Secure Keyboard using the menu again.

       ·   This ensures that you know which window is accepting your keystrokes.

       ·   It  cannot ensure that there are no processes which have access to your X display that might be observing
           the keystrokes as well.

       Only one X client at a time can grab the keyboard, so when you attempt to enable Secure Keyboard it may fail.
       In  this  case,  the  bell will sound.  If the Secure Keyboard succeeds, the foreground and background colors
       will be exchanged (as if you selected the Reverse Video entry in the Modes  menu);  they  will  be  exchanged
       again  when  you  exit secure mode.  If the colors do not switch, then you should be very suspicious that you
       are being spoofed.  If the application you are running displays a prompt before asking for the  password,  it
       is  safest  to enter secure mode before the prompt gets displayed, and to make sure that the prompt gets dis‐
       played correctly (in the new colors), to minimize the probability of spoofing.  You can  also  bring  up  the
       menu again and make sure that a check mark appears next to the entry.

       Secure  Keyboard  mode  will  be  disabled automatically if your xterm window becomes iconified (or otherwise
       unmapped), or if you start up a reparenting window manager (that places  a  title  bar  or  other  decoration
       around the window) while in Secure Keyboard mode.  (This is a feature of the X protocol not easily overcome.)
       When this happens, the foreground and background colors will be switched back and  the  bell  will  sound  in
       warning.

CHARACTER CLASSES
       Clicking  the  left  pointer  button twice in rapid succession (double-clicking) causes all characters of the
       same class (e.g., letters, white space, punctuation) to be selected as a “word”.  Since different people have
       different  preferences  for  what should be selected (for example, should filenames be selected as a whole or
       only the separate subnames), the default mapping can be overridden through the use of  the  charClass  (class
       CharClass) resource.

       This  resource  is  a series of comma-separated of range:value pairs.  The range is either a single number or
       low-high in the range of 0 to 65535, corresponding to the code for the character or  characters  to  be  set.
       The value is arbitrary, although the default table uses the character number of the first character occurring
       in the set.  When not in UTF-8 mode, only the first 256 bytes of this table will be used.

       The default table starts as follows -

           static int charClass[256] = {
           /∗ NUL  SOH  STX  ETX  EOT  ENQ  ACK  BEL */

              For example, the string “33:48,37:48,45-47:48,38:48” indicates  that  the  exclamation  mark,  percent
              sign,  dash,  period, slash, and ampersand characters should be treated the same way as characters and
              numbers.  This is useful for cutting and pasting electronic mailing addresses and filenames.

KEY BINDINGS
       It is possible to rebind keys (or sequences of keys) to arbitrary strings for input, by changing the transla‐
       tions  resources  for the vt100 or tek4014 widgets.  Changing the translations resource for events other than
       key and button events is not expected, and will cause unpredictable behavior.

   ACTIONS
       The following actions are provided for use within the vt100 or tek4014 translations resources:

       allow-color-ops(on/off/toggle)
               This action sets, unsets or toggles the allowColorOps resource and is  also  invoked  by  the  allow-
               color-ops entry in fontMenu.

       allow-font-ops(on/off/toggle)
               This  action sets, unsets or toggles the allowFontOps resource and is also invoked by the allow-font-
               ops entry in fontMenu.

       allow-send-events(on/off/toggle)
               This action sets, unsets or  toggles  the  allowSendEvents  resource  and  is  also  invoked  by  the
               allowsends entry in mainMenu.

       allow-tcap-ops(on/off/toggle)
               This  action sets, unsets or toggles the allowTcapOps resource and is also invoked by the allow-tcap-
               ops entry in fontMenu.

       allow-title-ops(on/off/toggle)
               This action sets, unsets or toggles the allowTitleOps resource and is  also  invoked  by  the  allow-
               title-ops entry in fontMenu.

       allow-window-ops(on/off/toggle)
               This action sets, unsets or toggles the allowWindowOps resource and is also invoked by the allow-win‐
               dow-ops entry in fontMenu.

       alt-sends-escape()
               This action toggles the state of the altSendsEscape resource.

       bell([percent])
               This action rings the keyboard bell at the specified percentage above or below the base volume.

       clear-saved-lines()
               This action does hard-reset() (see below) and also clears the history of lines saved off the  top  of
               the screen.  It is also invoked from the clearsavedlines entry in vtMenu.  The effect is identical to
               a hardware reset (RIS) control sequence.

       copy-selection(destname [, ...])
               This action puts the currently selected text into all of the selections or  cutbuffers  specified  by
               destname.   Unlike  select-end,  it  does  not send a mouse position or otherwise modify the internal
               selection state.

       create-menu(m/v/f/t)
               This action creates one of the menus used by xterm, if it  has  not  been  previously  created.   The
               parameter values are the menu names: mainMenu, vtMenu, fontMenu, tekMenu, respectively.

       dabbrev-expand()
               Expands the word before cursor by searching in the preceding text on the screen and in the scrollback
               buffer for words starting with  that  abbreviation.   Repeating  dabbrev-expand()  several  times  in
               sequence searches for an alternative expansion by looking farther back.  Lack of more matches is sig‐
               naled by a beep().  Attempts to expand an empty word (i.e., when cursor is preceded by a space) yield
               successively  all  previous  words.   Consecutive identical expansions are ignored.  The word here is
               defined as a sequence of non-whitespace characters.  This feature partially emulates the behavior  of
               “dynamic abbreviation” expansion in Emacs (bound there to M-/).  Here is a resource setting for xterm
               which will do the same thing:

                   *VT100*translations:    #override \n\
                           Meta <KeyPress> /:dabbrev-expand()

       deiconify()
               Changes the window state back to normal, if it was iconified.

       delete-is-del()
               This action toggles the state of the deleteIsDEL resource.

       dired-button()
               Handles a button event (other than press and release) by echoing the event's position (i.e.,  charac‐
               ter line and column) in the following format:

                       ^X ESC G <line+“ ”> <col+“ ”>

       fullscreen(on/off/toggle)
               This action sets, unsets or toggles the fullscreen resource.

       iconify()
               Iconifies the window.

       hard-reset()
               This  action  resets  the scrolling region, tabs, window size, and cursor keys and clears the screen.
               It is also invoked from the hardreset entry in vtMenu.

       ignore()
               This action ignores the event but checks for special pointer position escape sequences.

       insert()
               This action inserts the character or string associated with the key that was pressed.

       insert-eight-bit()
               This action inserts an eight-bit (Meta) version of the character or string associated  with  the  key
               that  was  pressed.   Only single-byte values are treated specially.  The exact action depends on the
               value of the altSendsEscape and the metaSendsEscape and the eightBitInput resources.   The  metaSend‐
               sEscape resource is tested first.  See the eightBitInput resource for a full discussion.

               The  term  “eight-bit”  is misleading: xterm checks if the key is in the range 128 to 255 (the eighth
               bit is set).  If the value is in that range, depending on the resource values, xterm may then do  one
               of the following:

               ·   add 128 to the value, setting its eighth bit,

               ·   send an ESC byte before the key, or

               ·   send the key unaltered.

       exec-formatted(format, sourcename [, ...])
               Execute  an  external command, using the current selection for part of the command's parameters.  The
               first parameter, format gives the basic command.  Succeeding parameters specify the selection  source
               as in insert-selection.

               The format parameter allows these substitutions:

               %%   inserts a "%".

               %P   the screen-position at the beginning of the highlighted region, as a semicolon-separated pair of
                    integers using the values that the CUP control sequence would use.

               %p   the screen-position after the beginning of the highlighted region, using the same convention  as
                    “%P”.

               %S   the length of the string that “%s” would insert.

               %s   the content of the selection, unmodified.

               %T   the length of the string that “%t” would insert.

               %t   the selection, trimmed of leading/trailing whitespace, and newlines changed to single spaces.

               %V   the  video  attributes at the beginning of the highlighted region, as a semicolon-separated list
                    of integers using the values that the SGR control sequence would use.

               %v   the video attributes after the end of the highlighted region, using the same convention as “%V”.

               After constructing the command-string, xterm forks a subprocess and executes the command, which  com‐
               pletes independently of xterm.

       exec-selectable(format, onClicks)
               Execute  an external command, using data copied from the screen for part of the command's parameters.
               The first parameter, format gives the basic command as in exec-formatted.  The second parameter spec‐
               ifies the method for copying the data as in the onClicks resource.

       insert-formatted(format, sourcename [, ...])
               Insert the current selection or data related to it, formatted.  The first parameter, format gives the
               template for the data as in exec-formatted.  Succeeding parameters specify the selection source as in
               insert-selection.

       insert-selectable(format, onClicks)
               Insert  data  copied  from the screen, formatted.  The first parameter, format gives the template for
               the data as in exec-formatted.  The second parameter specifies the method for copying the data as  in
               the onClicks resource.

       insert-selection(sourcename [, ...])
               This  action inserts the string found in the selection or cutbuffer indicated by sourcename.  Sources
               are checked in the order given (case is significant) until one is  found.   Commonly-used  selections
               include:  PRIMARY,  SECONDARY,  and  CLIPBOARD.   Cut buffers are typically named CUT_BUFFER0 through
               CUT_BUFFER7.

       insert-seven-bit()
               This action is a synonym for insert() The term “seven-bit” is misleading: it only implies that  xterm
               does not try to add 128 to the key's value as in insert-eight-bit().

       interpret(control-sequence)
               Interpret  the  given  control sequence locally, i.e., without passing it to the host.  This works by
               inserting the control sequence at the front of the input buffer.  Use “\” to escape octal  digits  in
               the string.  Xt does not allow you to put a null character (i.e., “\000”) in the string.

       keymap(name)
               This  action  dynamically defines a new translation table whose resource name is name with the suffix
               Keymap (case is significant).  The name None restores the original translation table.

       larger-vt-font()
               Set the font to the next larger one, based on the font dimensions.  See also set-vt-font().

       load-vt-fonts(name[,class])
               Load fontnames from the given subresource name and class.   That  is,  load  the  “*VT100.name.font”,
               resource as “*VT100.font” etc.  If no name is given, the original set of fontnames is restored.

               Unlike set-vt-font(), this does not affect the escape- and select-fonts, since those are not based on
               resource values.  It does affect the fonts loosely organized under the “Default” menu entry,  includ‐
               ing font, boldFont, wideFont and wideBoldFont.

       maximize()
               Resizes the window to fill the screen.

       meta-sends-escape()
               This action toggles the state of the metaSendsEscape resource.

       popup-menu(menuname)
               This action displays the specified popup menu.  Valid names (case is significant) include:  mainMenu,
               vtMenu, fontMenu, and tekMenu.

       print(printer-flags)
               This action prints the window.  It is also invoked by the print entry in mainMenu.

               The action accepts optional parameters, which temporarily override resource settings.  The  parameter
               values are matched ignoring case:

               noFormFeed
                    no  form  feed  will  be  sent  at  the  end  of the last line printed (i.e., printerFormFeed is
                    ``false'').

               FormFeed
                    a form feed will be sent at  the  end  of  the  last  line  printed  (i.e.,  printerFormFeed  is
                    ``true'').

               noNewLine
                    no  newline will be sent at the end of the last line printed, and wrapped lines will be combined
                    into long lines (i.e., printerNewLine is ``false'').

               NewLine
                    a newline will be sent at the end of the last line printed, and each line will  be  limited  (by
                    adding a newline) to the screen width (i.e., printerNewLine is ``true'').

               noAttrs
                    the page is printed without attributes (i.e., printAttributes is ``0'').

               monoAttrs
                    the page is printed with monochrome (vt220) attributes (i.e., printAttributes is ``1'').

               colorAttrs
                    the page is printed with ANSI color attributes (i.e., printAttributes is ``2'').

       print-everything(printer-flags)
               This  action sends the entire text history, in addition to the text currently visible, to the program
               given in the printerCommand resource.  It allows the same optional parameters as  the  print  action.
               With a suitable printer command, the action can be used to load the text history in an editor.

       print-immediate()
               Sends  the  text  of  the  current window directly to a file, as specified by the printFileImmediate,
               printModeImmediate and printOptsImmediate resources.

       print-on-error()
               Toggles a flag telling xterm that if it exits with an X error, to send the text of the current window
               directly  to  a  file,  as  specified  by  the  printFileXError,  printModeXError and printOptsXError
               resources.

       print-redir()
               This action toggles the printerControlMode between 0 and 2.  The corresponding popup  menu  entry  is
               useful for switching the printer off if you happen to change your mind after deciding to print random
               binary files on the terminal.

       quit()  This action sends a SIGHUP to the subprogram and exits.  It is also invoked  by  the  quit  entry  in
               mainMenu.

       readline-button()
               Supports  the  optional  readline  feature  by  echoing  repeated  cursor forward or backward control
               sequences on button release event, to request that the host application update its notion of the cur‐
               sor's position to match the button event.

       redraw()
               This action redraws the window.  It is also invoked by the redraw entry in mainMenu.

       restore()
               Restores the window to the size before it was last maximized.

       scroll-back(count [,units [,mouse] ])
               This action scrolls the text window backward so that text that had previously scrolled off the top of
               the screen is now visible.

               The count argument indicates the number of units (which may be page, halfpage,  pixel,  or  line)  by
               which to scroll.

               An  adjustment can be specified for these values by appending a “+” or “-” sign followed by a number,
               e.g., page-2 to specify 2 lines less than a page.

               If the third parameter mouse is given, the action is ignored when mouse reporting is enabled.

       scroll-forw(count [,units [,mouse] ])
               This action is similar to scroll-back except that it scrolls in the other direction.

       secure()
               This action toggles the Secure Keyboard mode described in the section named SECURITY, and is  invoked
               from the securekbd entry in mainMenu.

       scroll-lock(on/off/toggle)
               This  action  sets, unsets or toggles internal state which tells xterm whether Scroll Lock is active,
               subject to the allowScrollLock resource.

       select-cursor-end(destname [, ...])
               This action is similar to select-end except that it should be used with select-cursor-start.

       select-cursor-extend()

       select-cursor-start()
               This action is similar to select-start except that it begins the selection at the current text cursor
               position.

       select-end(destname [, ...])
               This  action  puts  the currently selected text into all of the selections or cutbuffers specified by
               destname.  It also sends a mouse position and updates the internal selection state to reflect the end
               of the selection process.

       select-extend()
               This action tracks the pointer and extends the selection.  It should only be bound to Motion events.

       select-set()
               This  action  stores  text that corresponds to the current selection, without affecting the selection
               mode.

       select-start()
               This action begins text selection at the current pointer location.  See the section on POINTER  USAGE
               for information on making selections.

       send-signal(signame)
               This action sends the signal named by signame to the xterm subprocess (the shell or program specified
               with the -e command line option).  It is also invoked by the suspend,  continue,  interrupt,  hangup,
               terminate,  and kill entries in mainMenu.  Allowable signal names are (case is not significant): tstp
               (if supported by the operating system), suspend (same as tstp), cont (if supported by  the  operating
               system), int, hup, term, quit, alrm, alarm (same as alrm) and kill.

               entry in vtMenu.

       set-vt-font(d/1/2/3/4/5/6/e/s [,normalfont [, boldfont]])
               This action sets the font or fonts currently being used in the VT102 window.  The first argument is a
               single character that specifies the font to be used:

               d or D indicate the default font (the font initially used when xterm was started),

               1 through 6 indicate the fonts specified by the font1 through font6 resources,

               e  or  E  indicate the normal and bold fonts that have been set through escape codes (or specified as
                      the second and third action arguments, respectively), and

               s or S indicate the font selection (as made by programs such as xfontsel(1)) indicated by the  second
                      action argument.

               If  xterm  is configured to support wide characters, an additional two optional parameters are recog‐
               nized for the e argument: wide font and wide bold font.

       smaller-vt-font()
               Set the font to the next smaller one, based on the font dimensions.  See also set-vt-font().

       soft-reset()
               This action resets the scrolling region.  It is also invoked from the softreset entry in vtMenu.  The
               effect is identical to a soft reset (DECSTR) control sequence.

       spawn-new-terminal(params)
               Spawn  a  new xterm process.  This is available on systems which have a modern version of the process
               filesystem, e.g., “/proc”, which xterm can read.

               Use the “cwd” process entry, e.g., /proc/12345/cwd to obtain the working  directory  of  the  process
               which is running in the current xterm.

               On  systems  which have the “exe” process entry, e.g., /proc/12345/exe, use this to obtain the actual
               executable.  Otherwise, use the $PATH variable to find xterm.

               If parameters are given in the action, pass them to the new xterm process.

       start-extend()
               This action is similar to select-start except that the selection is extended to the  current  pointer
               location.

       start-cursor-extend()
               This  action  is  similar  to select-extend except that the selection is extended to the current text
               cursor position.

       string(string)
               This action inserts the specified text string as if it had been typed.  Quotation is necessary if the
               string  contains  whitespace  or non-alphanumeric characters.  If the string argument begins with the
               characters “0x”, it is interpreted as a hex character constant.

       tek-copy()
               This action copies the escape codes used to generate the current window contents to  a  file  in  the
               current  directory  beginning  with the name COPY.  It is also invoked from the tekcopy entry in tek‐
               Menu.

       tek-page()
               This action clears the Tektronix window.  It is also invoked by the tekpage entry in tekMenu.

       tek-reset()
               This action resets the Tektronix window.  It is also invoked by the tekreset entry in tekMenu.

       vi-button()
               Handles a button event (other than press and release) by echoing a control sequence computed from the
               event's line number in the screen relative to the current line:

                       ESC ^P
               or
                       ESC ^N

               according to whether the event is before, or after the current line, respectively.  The ^N (or ^P) is
               repeated once for each line that the event differs from the current line.  The  control  sequence  is
               omitted altogether if the button event is on the current line.

       visual-bell()
               This action flashes the window quickly.

       The Tektronix window also has the following action:

       gin-press(l/L/m/M/r/R)
               This action sends the indicated graphics input code.

   DEFAULT KEY BINDINGS
       The  default  bindings  in  the  VT102  window  use  the  SELECT token, which is set by the selectToClipboard
       resource:

                     Shift <KeyPress> Prior:scroll-back(1,halfpage) \n\
                      Shift <KeyPress> Next:scroll-forw(1,halfpage) \n\

                                  <BtnDown>:ignore()

       The default bindings for the scrollbar widget are separate from the VT100 widget:

                                 <Btn5Down>: StartScroll(Forward) \n\
                                 <Btn1Down>: StartScroll(Forward) \n\
                                 <Btn2Down>: StartScroll(Continuous) MoveThumb() NotifyThumb() \n\
                                 <Btn3Down>: StartScroll(Backward) \n\
                                 <Btn4Down>: StartScroll(Backward) \n\
                                 <Btn2Motion>: MoveThumb() NotifyThumb() \n\
                                 <BtnUp>:    NotifyScroll(Proportional) EndScroll()

       The default bindings in the Tektronix window are:

                            ~Meta<KeyPress>: insert-seven-bit() \n\
                             Meta<KeyPress>: insert-eight-bit() \n\
                           !Ctrl <Btn1Down>: popup-menu(mainMenu) \n\
                      !Lock Ctrl <Btn1Down>: popup-menu(mainMenu) \n\
            !Lock Ctrl @Num_Lock <Btn1Down>: popup-menu(mainMenu) \n\
                 !Ctrl @Num_Lock <Btn1Down>: popup-menu(mainMenu) \n\
                           !Ctrl <Btn2Down>: popup-menu(tekMenu) \n\
                      !Lock Ctrl <Btn2Down>: popup-menu(tekMenu) \n\
            !Lock Ctrl @Num_Lock <Btn2Down>: popup-menu(tekMenu) \n\
                 !Ctrl @Num_Lock <Btn2Down>: popup-menu(tekMenu) \n\
                      Shift ~Meta<Btn1Down>: gin-press(L) \n\
                            ~Meta<Btn1Down>: gin-press(l) \n\
                      Shift ~Meta<Btn2Down>: gin-press(M) \n\
                            ~Meta<Btn2Down>: gin-press(m) \n\
                      Shift ~Meta<Btn3Down>: gin-press(R) \n\
                            ~Meta<Btn3Down>: gin-press(r)

       Here is an example which uses shifted select/paste to copy to the clipboard, and unshifted  select/paste  for
       the primary selection.  In each case, a (different) cut buffer is also a target or source of the select/paste
       operation.  It is important to remember however, that cut buffers store data in  ISO-8859-1  encoding,  while
       selections  can  store  data in a variety of formats and encodings.  While xterm owns the selection, it high‐
       lights it.  When it loses the selection, it removes the corresponding highlight.  But  you  can  still  paste
       from the corresponding cut buffer.

           *VT100*translations:    #override \n\
               ~Shift~Ctrl<Btn2Up>: insert-selection(PRIMARY, CUT_BUFFER0) \n\
               Shift~Ctrl<Btn2Up>:  insert-selection(CLIPBOARD, CUT_BUFFER1) \n\
               ~Shift<BtnUp>:       select-end(PRIMARY, CUT_BUFFER0) \n\
               Shift<BtnUp>:        select-end(CLIPBOARD, CUT_BUFFER1)

       Below is a sample of how the keymap() action is used to add special keys for entering commonly-typed works:

           *VT100.Translations: #override <Key>F13: keymap(dbx)
           *VT100.dbxKeymap.translations: \
                   <Key>F14: keymap(None) \n\
                   <Key>F17: string("next") string(0x0d) \n\
                   <Key>F18: string("step") string(0x0d) \n\
                   <Key>F19: string("continue") string(0x0d) \n\
                   <Key>F20: string("print ") insert-selection(PRIMARY, CUT_BUFFER0)

       Some  people  prefer  using  the  left pointer button for dragging the scrollbar thumb.  That can be setup by
       altering the translations resource, e.g.,

           *VT100.scrollbar.translations:                                #override \n\
                   <Btn5Down>:                                           StartScroll(Forward) \n\
                   <Btn1Down>:                                           StartScroll(Continuous) MoveThumb() NotifyThumb() \n\
                   <Btn4Down>:                                           StartScroll(Backward) \n\
                   <Btn1Motion>:                                         MoveThumb() NotifyThumb() \n\
                   <BtnUp>:  NotifyScroll(Proportional) EndScroll()

CONTROL SEQUENCES AND KEYBOARD
       The Xterm Control Sequences document lists the control sequences which an application can send xterm to  make
       it  perform  various operations.  Most of these operations are standardized, from either the DEC or Tektronix
       terminals, or from more widely used standards such as ISO-6429.

ENVIRONMENT
       Xterm sets several environment variables:

       DISPLAY
            is the display name, pointing to the X server (see DISPLAY NAMES in X(7)).

       TERM is set according to the termcap (or terminfo) entry which it is using as a reference.

       WINDOWID
            is set to the X window id number of the xterm window.

       XTERM_FILTER
            is set if a locale-filter is used.  The value is the pathname of the filter.

       XTERM_LOCALE
            shows the locale which was used by xterm on startup.  Some shell initialization scripts may set  a  dif‐
            ferent locale.

       XTERM_SHELL
            is set to the pathname of the program which is invoked.  Usually that is a shell program, e.g., /bin/sh.
            Since it is not necessarily a shell program however, it is distinct from “SHELL”.

       XTERM_VERSION
            is set to the string displayed by the -version option.  That is normally an identifier for the X  Window
            libraries  used  to  build  xterm, followed by xterm's patch number in parenthesis.  The patch number is
            also part of the response to a Secondary Device Attributes (DA)  control  sequence  (see  Xterm  Control
            Sequences).

       Depending on your system configuration, xterm may also set the following:

       COLUMNS
            the width of the xterm in characters (cf: “stty columns”).

       HOME when xterm is configured to update utmp.

       LINES
            the height of the xterm in characters (cf: “stty rows”).

       LOGNAME
            when xterm is configured to update utmp.

       SHELL
            when  xterm  is configured to update utmp.  It is also set if you provide the shell name as the optional
            parameter.

       TERMCAP
            the contents of the termcap entry corresponding to $TERM, with lines and columns values substituted  for
            the actual size window you have created.

       TERMINFO
            may be defined to a nonstandard location in the configure script.

FILES
       The actual pathnames given may differ on your system.

       /var/run/utmp
            the system logfile, which records user logins.

       /var/log/wtmp
            the system logfile, which records user logins and logouts.

       /etc/X11/app-defaults/XTerm
            the xterm default application resources.

       /etc/X11/app-defaults/XTerm-color
            the xterm color application resources.  If your display supports color, use this
                      *customization: -color
            in your .Xdefaults file to automatically use this resource file rather than /etc/X11/app-defaults/XTerm.
            If you do not do this, xterm uses its compiled-in default resource settings for colors.

       /usr/share/pixmaps
            the directory in which xterm's pixmap icon files are installed.

ERROR MESSAGES
       Most of the fatal error messages from xterm use the following format:
              xterm: Error XXX, errno YYY: ZZZ
       The XXX codes (which are used by xterm as its exit-code) are listed below, with a brief explanation.

       1    is used for miscellaneous errors, usually accompanied by a specific message,

BUGS
       Large pastes do not work on some systems.  This is not a bug in xterm; it is a bug  in  the  pseudo  terminal
       driver  of  those systems.  xterm feeds large pastes to the pty only as fast as the pty will accept data, but
       some pty drivers do not return enough information to know if the write has succeeded.

       When connected to an input method, it is possible for xterm to hang if the XIM server is suspended or killed.

       Many of the options are not resettable after xterm starts.

       This program still needs to be rewritten.  It should be split into very modular sections,  with  the  various
       emulators  being  completely  separate  widgets that do not know about each other.  Ideally, you'd like to be
       able to pick and choose emulator widgets and stick them into a single control widget.

       There needs to be a dialog box to allow entry of the Tek COPY file name.
