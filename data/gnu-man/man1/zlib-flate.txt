NAME
       zlib-flate - raw zlib compression program

SYNOPSIS
       zlib-flate -compress | -uncompress

DESCRIPTION
       The zlib-flate program is part of the qpdf package.

       The  zlib-flate  program reads from standard input and writes to standard output either compressing or uncom‐
       pressing its input using raw zlib compression.  It can be used to uncompress or compress raw PDF  streams  or
       other  data  that is compressed with raw zlib compression.  This program is provided primarily as a debugging
       tool, though it could be used for other purposes, such as being called from a script that creates simple  PDF
       files.

       This program should not be used as a general purpose compression tool.  Use something like gzip(1) instead.

       For  details  about  qpdf,  please  see  the qpdf manual, which can be found in /usr/share/doc/qpdf/qpdf-man‐
       ual.html or /usr/share/doc/qpdf/qpdf-manual.pdf.
