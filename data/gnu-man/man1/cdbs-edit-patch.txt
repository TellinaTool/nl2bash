NAME
       cdbs-edit-patch - create or edit a CDBS simple-patchsys.mk patch


SYNOPSIS
       cdbs-edit-patch patchname


DESCRIPTION
       cdbs-edit-patch  creates  or  edits  patches  for  use by the CDBS simple-patchsys.mk patch system.  For more
       information about CDBS please see the documentation under /usr/share/doc/cdbs/.

       When patchname exists, cdbs-edit-patch will set up a temporary working source tree, apply all patches  up  to
       and including patchname in lexicographic order, and spawn an interactive shell for the developer.  The devel‐
       oper can then edit  files  in  this  working  tree.   When  the  developer  is  done  and  exits  the  shell,
       cdbs-edit-patch  updates  patchname  to  reflect the changes made.  To abort the process from the interactive
       shell, exit with a nonzero exit value.

       When patchname does not exist, cdbs-edit-patch will assume that a new patch should be created.  As  with  the
       above scenario, cdbs-edit-patch will first create a temporary working source tree and apply all patches up to
       the new patch in lexicographic order.  When the shell is quit, cdbs-edit-patch will create patchname.
