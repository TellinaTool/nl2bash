NAME
       base64 - base64 encode/decode data and print to standard output

SYNOPSIS
       base64 [OPTION]... [FILE]

DESCRIPTION
       Base64 encode or decode FILE, or standard input, to standard output.

       Mandatory arguments to long options are mandatory for short options too.

       -d, --decode
              decode data

       -i, --ignore-garbage
              when decoding, ignore non-alphabet characters

       -w, --wrap=COLS
              wrap encoded lines after COLS character (default 76).  Use 0 to disable line wrapping

       --help display this help and exit

       --version
              output version information and exit

       With no FILE, or when FILE is -, read standard input.

       The  data are encoded as described for the base64 alphabet in RFC 3548.  When decoding, the input may contain
       newlines in addition to the bytes of the formal base64 alphabet.  Use --ignore-garbage to attempt to  recover
       from any other non-alphabet bytes in the encoded stream.
