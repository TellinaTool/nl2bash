NAME
       extractbb, ebb - extract bounding box information from graphics files

SYNOPSIS
       extractbb [-v|-q] [-O] [-m|-x] file...

DESCRIPTION
       For  each  JPEG,  PNG, or PDF file given on the command line, extractbb extracts the bounding box information
       and writes it into a file with extension .xbb, together with some header information. These files can then be
       used  by  dvipdfmx  or  other  programs.  For  PDF  files, the number of pages and the PDF version number are
       reported as well.  The input filename extension may be in upper or lower case.

       If called as ebb, the output is written in the ``bb'' format (and with extension .bb)  as  used  by  dvipdfm.
       Xbb may be defined as a synomym for extractbb on your system.

OPTIONS
       -v        Be verbose.
       -q        Be quiet.
       -O        Write output to standard output.
       -m        Write output in dvipdfm's ``bb'' format.
       -x        Write output in dvipdfmx's ``xbb'' format (default), which is the same as that used by pdfTeX.

OUTPUT FORMATS
       Here are more details about the bb and xbb formats:

       The  original  ebb  (from dvipdfm) ignored density information in bitmap images, and generated bounding boxes
       with 100px = 72bp = 1in.  Unfortunately, screenshots (especially) tend to look bad with this approach.

       So, extractbb (from dvipdfmx) uses density information if present.  Otherwise, it generates bounding box with
       100px = 100bp.  This is what pdfTeX does.

BUGS
       There  is  currently no way to specify which bounding box is taken for PDF files. It will always be the first
       one from the following list: ArtBox, TrimBox, BleedBox, MediaBox. (Often only MediaBox is defined.) Moreover,
       the reported bounding box always refers to the first page in a PDF file.
