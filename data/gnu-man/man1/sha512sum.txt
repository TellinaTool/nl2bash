SHA512SUM(1)                                        User Commands                                       SHA512SUM(1)



NAME
       sha512sum - compute and check SHA512 message digest

SYNOPSIS
       sha512sum [OPTION]... [FILE]...

DESCRIPTION
       Print or check SHA512 (512-bit) checksums.  With no FILE, or when FILE is -, read standard input.

       -b, --binary
              read in binary mode

       -c, --check
              read SHA512 sums from the FILEs and check them

       --tag  create a BSD-style checksum

       -t, --text
              read in text mode (default)

   The following three options are useful only when verifying checksums:
       --quiet
              don't print OK for each successfully verified file

       --status
              don't output anything, status code shows success

       -w, --warn
              warn about improperly formatted checksum lines

       --strict
              with --check, exit non-zero for any invalid input

       --help display this help and exit

       --version
              output version information and exit

       The sums are computed as described in FIPS-180-2.  When checking, the input should be a former output of this
       program.  The default mode is to print a line with checksum, a  character  indicating  input  mode  ('*'  for
       binary, space for text), and name for each FILE.
