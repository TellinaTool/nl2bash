NAME
       pgmtopbm - convert a portable graymap into a portable bitmap

SYNOPSIS
       pgmtopbm  [-floyd|-fs|-threshold |-hilbert |-dither8|-d8|-cluster3 |-c3|-cluster4|-c4 |-cluster8|-c8] [-value
       val] [-clump size] [pgmfile]

DESCRIPTION
       Reads a portable graymap as input.  Produces a portable bitmap as output.

       Note that there is no pbmtopgm converter.  Any program that uses the Netpbm  libraries  to  read  PGM  files,
       including  virtually  all  programs in the Netpbm package, will read a PBM file automatically as if it were a
       PGM file.

       If you are using a less intelligent program that expects PGM input, use pnmdepth to convert the PBM  file  to
       PGM.   As  long  as  the  depth is greater than 1, pnmdepth will generate PGM.  This less intelligent program
       quite probably is also not intelligent enough to deal with general maxvals, so you should specify a depth  of
       255.


OPTIONS
       The  default  quantization  method  is boustrophedonic Floyd-Steinberg error diffusion (-floyd or -fs).  Also
       available are simple thresholding (-threshold); Bayer's ordered dither (-dither8) with a  16x16  matrix;  and
       three  different  sizes of 45-degree clustered-dot dither (-cluster3, -cluster4, -cluster8).  A space filling
       curve halftoning method using the Hilbert curve is also available.  (-hilbert);

       Floyd-Steinberg will almost always give the best looking results; however, looking good is  not  always  what
       you  want.  For instance, thresholding can be used in a pipeline with the pnmconvol tool, for tasks like edge
       and peak detection.  And clustered-dot dithering gives a newspaper-ish look, a useful special effect.

       The -value flag alters the thresholding value for Floyd-Steinberg and simple thresholding.  It  should  be  a
       real number between 0 and 1.  Above 0.5 means darker images; below 0.5 means lighter.

       The  Hilbert  curve method is useful for processing images before display on devices that do not render indi‐
       vidual pixels distinctly (like laser printers). This dithering  method  can  give  better  results  than  the
       dithering  usually  done  by the laser printers themselves.  The -clump flag alters the number of pixels in a
       clump. This is usually an integer between 2 and 100 (default 5). Smaller clump sizes smear the image less and
       are less grainy, but seem to loose some grey scale linearity. Typically a PGM image will have to be scaled to
       fit on a laser printer page (2400 x 3000 pixels for an A4 300 dpi page), and then dithered  to  a  PBM  image
       before being converted to a postscript file.  A printing pipeline might look something like: pnmscale -xysize
       2400 3000 image.pgm | pgmtopbm -hil | pnmtops -scale 0.25 > image.ps

       All flags can be abbreviated to their shortest unique prefix.
