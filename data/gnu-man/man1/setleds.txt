SETLEDS(1)                                     General Commands Manual                                    SETLEDS(1)



NAME
       setleds - set the keyboard leds

SYNOPSIS
       setleds [-v] [-L] [-D] [-F] [{+|-}num] [{+|-}caps] [{+|-}scroll]

DESCRIPTION
       Setleds reports and changes the led flag settings of a VT (namely NumLock, CapsLock and ScrollLock).  Without
       arguments, setleds prints the current settings.  With arguments, it sets or clears the indicated  flags  (and
       leaves the others unchanged).  The settings before and after the change are reported if the -v flag is given.

       The led flag settings are specific for each VT (and the VT corresponding to stdin is used).

       By  default (or with option -F), setleds will only change the VT flags (and their setting may be reflected by
       the keyboard leds).

       With option -D, setleds will change both the VT flags and their default settings (so that a subsequent  reset
       will not undo the change).  This might be useful for people who always want to have numlock set.

       With option -L, setleds will not touch the VT flags, but only change the leds.  From this moment on, the leds
       will no longer reflect the VT flags (but display whatever is put into them).  The command setleds -L (without
       further arguments) will restore the situation in which the leds reflect the VT flags.

       One might use setleds in /etc/rc to define the initial and default state of NumLock, e.g. by
            INITTY=/dev/tty[1-8]
            for tty in $INITTY; do
                 setleds -D +num < $tty
            done

OPTIONS
       -num +num
              Clear  or set NumLock.  (At present, the NumLock setting influences the interpretation of keypad keys.
              Pressing the NumLock key complements the NumLock setting.)

       -caps +caps
              Clear or set CapsLock.  (At present, the CapsLock setting complements the Shift key  when  applied  to
              letters.  Pressing the CapsLock key complements the CapsLock setting.)

       -scroll +scroll
              Clear  or  set  ScrollLock.   (At present, pressing the ScrollLock key (or ^S/^Q) stops/starts console
              output.)

BUGS
       In keyboard application mode the NumLock key does not influence the NumLock flag setting.
