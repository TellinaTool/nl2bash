NAME
       ps2ps, eps2eps - Ghostscript PostScript "distiller"

SYNOPSIS
       ps2ps [ options ] input.ps output.ps
       eps2eps [ options ] input.eps output.eps

DESCRIPTION
       ps2ps  uses gs(1) to convert PostScript(tm) file "input.ps" to simpler, normalized and (usually) faster Post‐
       Script in "output.ps".  Normally the output is allowed to use PostScript Level 2 or Level 3  constructs,  but
       the -dLanguageLevel=1 option restricts the output to Level 1.

       eps2eps performs the equivalent optimization for Encapsulated PostScript (EPS) files.

       Both  accept  any  general Ghostscript command line options, and respectively options specific to the pswrite
       and epswrite devices.

FILES
       Run "gs -h" to find the location of Ghostscript documentation on your system, from which  you  can  get  more
       details.

BUGS
       The  pswrite  device  used  by both ps2ps and eps2eps produces much lower level output than is desirable. Use
       with caution.
