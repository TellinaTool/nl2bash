PERLIVP(1)                                Perl Programmers Reference Guide                                PERLIVP(1)



NAME
       perlivp - Perl Installation Verification Procedure

SYNOPSIS
       perlivp [-p] [-v] [-h]

DESCRIPTION
       The perlivp program is set up at Perl source code build time to test the Perl version it was built under.  It
       can be used after running:

           make install

       (or your platform's equivalent procedure) to verify that perl and its libraries have been installed
       correctly.  A correct installation is verified by output that looks like:

           ok 1
           ok 2

       etc.

OPTIONS
       -h help
            Prints out a brief help message.

       -p print preface
            Gives a description of each test prior to performing it.

       -v verbose
            Gives more detailed information about each test, after it has been performed.  Note that any failed
            tests ought to print out some extra information whether or not -v is thrown.

DIAGNOSTICS
       ·   print "# Perl binary '$perlpath' does not appear executable.\n";

           Likely to occur for a perl binary that was not properly installed.  Correct by conducting a proper
           installation.

       ·   print "# Perl version '$]' installed, expected $ivp_VERSION.\n";

           Likely to occur for a perl that was not properly installed.  Correct by conducting a proper installation.

       ·   print "# Perl \@INC directory '$_' does not appear to exist.\n";

           Likely to occur for a perl library tree that was not properly installed.  Correct by conducting a proper
           installation.

       ·   print "# Needed module '$_' does not appear to be properly installed.\n";

           One of the two modules that is used by perlivp was not present in the installation.  This is a serious
           error since it adversely affects perlivp's ability to function.  You may be able to correct this by
           performing a proper perl installation.

       ·   print "# Required module '$_' does not appear to be properly installed.\n";

           An attempt to "eval "require $module"" failed, even though the list of extensions indicated that it
           should succeed.  Correct by conducting a proper installation.

       ·   print "# Unnecessary module 'bLuRfle' appears to be installed.\n";

           This test not coming out ok could indicate that you have in fact installed a bLuRfle.pm module or that
           the "eval " require \"$module_name.pm\"; "" test may give misleading results with your installation of
           perl.  If yours is the latter case then please let the author know.

       ·   print "# file",+($#missing == 0) ? '' : 's'," missing from installation:\n";

           One or more files turned up missing according to a run of "ExtUtils::Installed -> validate()" over your
           installation.  Correct by conducting a proper installation.

       For further information on how to conduct a proper installation consult the INSTALL file that comes with the
       perl source and the README file for your platform.
