DESCRIPTION
       udisksctl is a command-line program used to interact with the udisksd(8) daemon process.

COMMANDS
       status
           Shows high-level information about disk drives and block devices.

       info
           Shows detailed information about OBJECT or DEVICE.

       mount
           Mounts a device. The device will be mounted in a subdirectory in the /media hierarchy - upon successful
           completion, the mount point will be printed to standard output.

           The device will be mounted with a safe set of default options. You can influence the options passed to
           the mount(8) command with --options. Note that only safe options are allowed - requests with inherently
           unsafe options such as suid or dev that would allow the caller to gain additional privileges, are
           rejected.

       unmount
           Unmounts a device. This only works if the device is mounted. The option --force can be used to request
           that the device is unmounted even if active references exists.

       unlock
           Unlocks an encrypted device. The passphrase will be requested from the controlling terminal and upon
           successful completion, the cleartext device will be printed to standard output.

       lock
           Locks a device. This only works if the device is a cleartext device backed by a cryptotext device.

       loop-setup
           Sets up a loop device backed by FILE.

       loop-delete
           Tears down a loop device.

       power-off
           Arranges for the drive to be safely removed and powered off. On the OS side this includes ensuring that
           no process is using the drive, then requesting that in-flight buffers and caches are committed to stable
           storage. The exact steps for powering off the drive depends on the drive itself and the interconnect
           used. For drives connected through USB, the effect is that the USB device will be deconfigured followed
           by disabling the upstream hub port it is connected to.

           Note that as some physical devices contain multiple drives (for example 4-in-1 flash card reader USB
           devices) powering off one drive may affect other drives. As such there are not a lot of guarantees
           associated with performing this action. Usually the effect is that the drive disappears as if it was
           unplugged.

       smart-simulate
           Sets SMART data from the libatasmart blob given by FILE - see /usr/share/doc/libatasmart-devel-VERSION/
           for blobs shipped with libatasmart. This is a debugging feature used to check that applications act
           correctly when a disk is failing.

       monitor
           Monitors the daemon for events.

       dump
           Prints the current state of the daemon.

       help
           Prints help and exit.

COMMON OPTIONS
       The option --no-user-interaction can be used to request that no interaction (such as the user being presented
       with an authentication dialog) must occur when checking with polkit(8) whether the caller is authorized to
       perform the requested action.

AUDIENCE
       This program does not assume that the caller is the super user - it is intended to be used by unprivileged
       users and authorizations are checked by the udisks daemon using polkit(8). Additionally, this program is not
       intended to be used by scripts or other programs - options/commands may change in incompatible ways in the
       future even in maintenance releases. See the “API STABILITY” section of udisks(8) for more information.

BASH COMPLETION
       udisksctl ships with a bash completion script to complete commands, objects, block devices and some options.
