NAME
       ppmtoyuvsplit - convert a portable pixmap into 3 subsampled raw YUV files

SYNOPSIS
       ppmtoyuvsplit basename [ppmfile]

DESCRIPTION
       Reads  a  portable  pixmap  as  input.  Produces 3 raw files basename.Y, basename.U and basename.V as output.
       These files are the subsampled raw YUV representation of the input pixmap, as required by the  Stanford  MPEG
       codec.  The  subsampling  is  done  by arithmetic mean of 4 pixels colors into one. The YUV values are scaled
       according to CCIR.601, as assumed by MPEG.
