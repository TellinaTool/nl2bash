NAME
       captoinfo - convert a termcap description into a terminfo description

SYNOPSIS
       captoinfo [-vn width]  [-V] [-1] [-w width] file . . .

DESCRIPTION
       captoinfo looks in each given text file for termcap descriptions.  For each one found, an equivalent terminfo
       description is written to standard output.  Termcap tc capabilities are translated directly to  terminfo  use
       capabilities.

       If  no file is given, then the environment variable TERMCAP is used for the filename or entry.  If TERMCAP is
       a full pathname to a file, only the terminal whose name is specified in  the  environment  variable  TERM  is
       extracted  from  that  file.   If the environment variable TERMCAP is not set, then the file /etc/terminfo is
       read.

       -v   print out tracing information on standard error as the program runs.

       -V   print out the version of the program in use on standard error and exit.

       -1   cause the fields to print out one to a line.  Otherwise, the fields will be printed several to a line to
            a maximum width of 60 characters.

       -w   change the output to width characters.

FILES
       /etc/terminfo       Compiled terminal description database.

TRANSLATIONS FROM NONSTANDARD CAPABILITIES
       Some  obsolete nonstandard capabilities will automatically be translated into standard (SVr4/XSI Curses) ter‐
       minfo capabilities by captoinfo.  Whenever one of these automatic translations  is  done,  the  program  will
       issue  an  notification  to  stderr,  inviting the user to check that it has not mistakenly translated a com‐
       pletely unknown and random capability and/or syntax error.

       XENIX termcap also used to have a set of extension capabilities for forms drawing, designed to take advantage
       of the IBM PC high-half graphics.  They were as follows:

       Cap          Graphic
       ─────────────────────────────
       G2    upper left
       G3    lower left
       G1    upper right
       G4    lower right
       GR    pointing right
       GL    pointing left
       GU    pointing up
       GD    pointing down
       GH    horizontal line
       GV    vertical line
       GC    intersection
       G6    upper left
       G7    lower left

       Gh    horizontal line
       Gv    vertical line
       Gc    intersection
       GG    acs magic cookie count

       If  the  single-line capabilities occur in an entry, they will automatically be composed into an acsc string.
       The double-line capabilities and GG are discarded with a warning message.

       IBM's AIX has a terminfo facility descended from SVr1 terminfo but incompatible with the  SVr4  format.   The
       following AIX extensions are automatically translated:

        IBM    XSI
       ─────────────
       ksel    kslt
       kbtab   kcbt
       font0   s0ds
       font1   s1ds
       font2   s2ds
       font3   s3ds

       Additionally, the AIX box1 capability will be automatically translated to an acsc string.

       Hewlett-Packard's terminfo library supports two nonstandard terminfo capabilities meml (memory lock) and memu
       (memory unlock).  These will be discarded with a warning message.

NOTES
       This utility is actually a link to tic(1), running in -I mode.  You can use other tic options such as -f  and
       -x.

       The  trace  option is not identical to SVr4's.  Under SVr4, instead of following the -v with a trace level n,
       you repeat it n times.
