thinkjettopbm(1)                               General Commands Manual                              thinkjettopbm(1)



NAME
       thinkjettopbm - convert HP ThinkJet printer commands file to PBM

SYNOPSIS
       thinkjettopbm [-d] [thinkjet_file]


DESCRIPTION
       Reads  HP  ThinkJet printer commands from the standard input, or thinkjet_file if specified, and writes a PBM
       image to the standard output.  Text and non-graphics command sequences are silently ignored.

       The -d option turns on debugging messages which are written to the standard error stream.


BUGS
       Handles only a small subset of ThinkJet command sequences, but enough to convert screen images from older  HP
       test equipment.


SEE ALSO
