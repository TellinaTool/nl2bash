NAME
       fgconsole - print the number of the active VT.


SYNOPSIS
       fgconsole [--help|--version|--next-available]

DESCRIPTION
       If the active Virtual Terminal is /dev/ttyN, then prints N on standard output.

       If the console is a serial console, then "serial" is printed instead.

       --next-available
              Will show the next unallocated virtual terminal. Normally 6 virtual terminals are allocated, with num‐
              ber 7 used for X; this will return "8" in this case.


NOTES
       Under devfs, the consoles are in /dev/vc/N.  devfsd may maintain symlinks for compatibility.
