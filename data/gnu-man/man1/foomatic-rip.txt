NAME
       foomatic-rip - Universal print filter/RIP wrapper

SYNOPSIS
   General Options:
       foomatic-rip [-v] [-q] <mode-specific options>


   Spooler-less printing filter:
       foomatic-rip [-P <printer>  |  --ppd  <ppdfile> ]  [-J <jobtitle> ] [-o  <option>=<value>  [...]]  [<files>]


   CUPS filter:
       foomatic-rip <jobid> <user> <jobtitle> <numcopies> <options> [<file>]


DESCRIPTION
       foomatic-rip  is  a  universal print filter which can be used as CUPS filter or stand-alone for spooler-less,
       direct printing. It has the following features:

       It translates PostScript and PDF from standard input or a file to the printer's native language  on  standard
       output.

       The  translation  is done with an external renderer, usually Ghostscript (gs(1)). If no translation is needed
       (PostScript printer) the renderer's command line reduces to cat(1). The way how this translation is  done  is
       described in a PPD file.

       Printer  capabilities,  how  to  handle  user  options,  and how to build the renderer command line is always
       described by PPD files, these PPD files usually come from Foomatic or can be the ones supplied by  the  manu‐
       facturers of PostScript printers. The PPD files are the same for both CUPS and direct printing.

       foomatic-rip  works  with  CUPS and for direct printing without spooler). The mode is selected by the command
       line options and environment variables which are supplied to foomatic-rip.

       foomatic-rip does not only apply option settings supplied by the user through the command line of the  print‐
       ing  command,  but also searches the entire job for embedded option settings (only PostScript jobs). Here not
       only settings which affect the whole job are taken into account, but also settings in the page headers, which
       are  only  valid for the page where they were found, so applications which produce PostScript code with page-
       specific printer option settings are fully supported.


DIRECT, SPOOLER-LESS PRINTING
   Options
       -v        verbose mode for debugging.  WARNING: This will create a file in /tmp that contains  the  debugging
                 information.  This opens a security loophole and should not be used in production.


       -q        quiet mode - minimal information output


       -P <printer>
                 <printer> is the configured printer which should be used for this job.


       --ppd <ppdfile>
                 The PPD file <ppdfile> should be applied for processing this job.

       -o <option>=<value>
                 Option settings for this job.

       <files>   The file(s) to be printed.


       foomatic-rip  will  print from standard input unless at least one file to be printed is specified on the com‐
       mand   line.    If    your    printer    PPD    file    is    stored    as    /etc/direct/<printer>.ppd    or
       ~/.foomatic/direct/<printer>.ppd you can use it by simply specifying "-P <printer>".

       Put a line

       *FoomaticRIPPostPipe: "| <command>"

       into  the  PPD  file,  right after *PPD-Adobe: "4.3", where <command> is a command into which you want to re-
       direct the output data. Due to the restrictions of PPD files <, >, and " are not allowed  in  the  <command>,
       replace them as follows:

       Character Replacement
       ---------------------
            <    &lt;
            >    &gt;
            "    &quot;
            '    &apos;
            &    &amp;

       This way you can print directly to your printer, use

       *FoomaticRIPPostPipe: "| cat &gt; /dev/lp0"

       or

       *FoomaticRIPPostPipe: "| cat &gt; /dev/usb/lp0"

       for  local parallel or USB printers. To make normal users able to print this way add them to the group lp and
       make sure that the appropriate printer device file /dev/... is group-writable for the lp group.

       for a TCP/Socket/JetDirect printer with the host name printer listening on port 9100 you need this:

       *FoomaticRIPPostPipe: "| /usr/bin/nc -w 1 printer 9100"

       Note the "-w 1" in the "nc" command line, it makes "nc" exiting immediately after the data is transferred  to
       the printer.

       *FoomaticRIPPostPipe: "| rlpr -Plp@printserver"

       directs your jobs to the LPD printer queue lp on the machine named printserver.

CONFIGURATION FILE
       The  file  /etc/foomatic/filter.conf  is  read  whenever foomatic-rip is executed. It allows to configure the
       behavior of foomatic-rip as follows (lines beginning with # are comments and therefore get ignored):


       debug: 0|1
                 Turns on (1) or off (0) the debug mode. This is equivalent to supplying the  --debug  command  line
                 option. Default setting is 0.


       ps_accounting: 0|1
                 Turns  on  (1)  or  off (0) inserting PostScript code for page accounting into PostScript jobs. The
                 inserted PostScript code makes Ghostscript generating accounting output on stderr and CUPS can this
                 way log each page which got printed. The code will only be inserted if CUPS is the spooler. Default
                 setting is 1.


       echo: [<path>/]<executable>
                 Sets the path to an echo(1) executable which supports -n.


       gspath: [<path>/]<executable>
                 Sets the path to the Ghostscript (gs(1)) executable. To be used if Ghostscript is at a non-standard
                 location or if an alternative Ghostscript should be used.


       execpath: <path>[:<path>]...
                 Sets the $PATH variable to be used by foomatic-rip.


       cupsfilterpath: <path>[:<path>]...
                 Sets the directories (colon-separated) in which foomatic-rip searches for CUPS filters.


       preferred_shell: [<path>/]<executable>
                 Sets  the  preferred  shell  to  use when executing FoomaticRIPCommandLine and friends. Several PPD
                 files use shell constructs that require a more modern shell like bash, zsh, or ksh.
