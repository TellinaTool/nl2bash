       specification.

       This includes proper handling of trigraphs, disabling non-ANSI compiler features (such  as  asm  ,  inline  ,
       typeof , and the $ character in identifiers), and definition of the preprocessor symbol __STRICT_ANSI__ .

SEE ALSO
       cc(1) for a description of all options.

BUGS
       Since c89 is a shell wrapper script to cc , compile errors are prefixed by "cc:".
