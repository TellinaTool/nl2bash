NAME
       gtkdoc-mkdb —  creates the DocBook files from the edited templates.

SYNOPSIS
       gtkdoc-mkdb [ nothing ]

DESCRIPTION

       This binary must be used inside a Makefile and not directly in a command line. See section EXAMPLE.

NOTE
       When  creating  SGML  IDS, we append -CAPS to all all-caps identifiers to prevent name clashes. (It basically
       never is the case that mixed-case identifiers would collide.) See the CreateValidSGMLID function.

EXAMPLE
       See /usr/share/doc/gtk-doc-tools/examples, for a makefile.am and a configure.in example file.
