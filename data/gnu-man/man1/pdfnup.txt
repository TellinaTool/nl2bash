NAME
       pdfnup - n-up the pages of pdf files

SYNOPSIS
       pdfnup [OPTION [OPTION] ...] [SRC [PAGESPEC] [SRC [PAGESPEC]] ...]

DESCRIPTION
       pdfnup converts files in the Adobe Portable Document Format (PDF) to "n-up" PDF files, that is, with multiple
       input pages per output page, for more economical printing etc.  The default processing is to  2-up  landscape
       output  with  no  frame  around  pages,  equivalent  to using the options '--nup 2x1 --landscape true --frame
       false'.

       If no source PDF file ('SRC') is specified, input is from /dev/stdin. If 'PAGESPEC' is omitted, all pages are
       processed.

       Source  files  are  processed sequentially into a single output unless the '--batch' option is used, in which
       case they are processed separately.

       pdfnup operates on one or more PDF files, and (either with the '--batch' option or with '--outfile DIR' where
       'DIR'  is  a  directory)  the  resulting  files have the suffix '-nup' applied to their names by default.  To
       change the suffix, use the '--suffix' option, for example

              pdfnup --nup 2x2 --suffix '2x2' --batch myfile1.pdf myfile2.pdf

       will result in files named 'myfile1-2x2.pdf' and 'myfile2-2x2.pdf'.

       pdfnup is a simple wrapper for pdfjam, which provides a front end to many of the capabilities of the pdfpages
       package  for  pdflatex.   A  working  installation  of  pdflatex, with the pdfpages and geometry packages, is
       required.

       pdfnup is part of the "PDFjam" package of tools, whose homepage is at http://www.warwick.ac.uk/go/pdfjam .
