NAME
       7za - A file archiver with highest compression ratio

SYNOPSIS
       7za [adeltux] [-] [SWITCH] <ARCHIVE_NAME> <ARGUMENTS>...

DESCRIPTION
       7-Zip  is  a  file archiver with the highest compression ratio. The program supports 7z (that implements LZMA
       compression algorithm), LZMA2, XZ, ZIP, Zip64, CAB, RAR (if the non-free  p7zip-rar  package  is  installed),
       ARJ,  GZIP,  BZIP2, TAR, CPIO, RPM, ISO, most filesystem images and DEB formats. Compression ratio in the new
       7z format is 30-50% better than ratio in ZIP format.

       7za is a stand-alone executable. 7za handles less archive formats than 7z.

       -l     don't store symlinks; store the files/directories they point to (CAUTION  :  the  scanning  stage  can
              never end because of recursive symlinks like 'ln -s .. ldir')

       -m{Parameters}
              Set  Compression  Method  (see /usr/share/doc/p7zip-full/DOCS/MANUAL/switches/method.htm for a list of
              methods)

       -mhe=on|off
              7z format only : enables or disables archive header encryption (Default : off)

              Set Output directory

       -p{Password}
              Set Password

       -r[-|0]
              Recurse subdirectories (CAUTION: this flag does not do what you think, avoid using it)

       -sfx[{name}]
              Create SFX archive

       -si    Read data from StdIn (eg: tar cf - directory | 7za a -si directory.tar.7z)

       -so    Write data to StdOut (eg: % echo foo | 7z a dummy -tgzip -si -so > /dev/null)

       -slt   Sets technical mode for l (list) command

       -t{Type}
              Type of archive (7z, zip, gzip, bzip2 or tar. 7z format is default)

       -v{Size}[b|k|m|g]
              Create volumes

       -u[-][p#][q#][r#][x#][y#][z#][!newArchiveName]
              Update options

       -w[path]
              Set Working directory

       -x[r[-|0]]]{@listfile|!wildcard}
              Exclude filenames

       -y     Assume Yes on all queries

DIAGNOSTICS
       7-Zip returns the following exit codes:

              0      Normal (no errors or warnings detected)

              1      Warning (Non fatal error(s)). For example, some files cannot be  read  during  compressing.  So
                     they were not compressed

              2      Fatal error

              7      Bad command line parameters

              8      Not enough memory for operation

              255    User stopped the process with control-C (or similar)

Backup and limitations
       DO NOT USE the 7-zip format for backup purpose on Linux/Unix because :
        - 7-zip does not store the owner/group of the file.


       On Linux/Unix, in order to backup directories you must use tar :
        - to backup a directory  : tar cf - directory | 7za a -si directory.tar.7z
        - to restore your backup : 7za x -so directory.tar.7z | tar xf -

       If you want to send files and directories (not the owner of file) to others Unix/MacOS/Windows users, you can
       use the 7-zip format.

         example : 7za a directory.7z  directory


       Do not use "-r" because this flag does not do what you think.

       Do not use directory/* because of ".*" files (example : "directory/*" does not match "directory/.profile")

EXAMPLE 1
       7za a -t7z -m0=lzma -mx=9 -mfb=64 -md=32m -ms=on archive.7z dir1
              adds all files from directory "dir1" to archive archive.7z using "ultra settings"

       -t7z   7z archive

       -m0=lzma
              lzma method

       -mx=9  level of compression = 9 (Ultra)

       -mfb=64
              number of fast bytes for LZMA = 64

       -md=32m
              dictionary size = 32 megabytes

       -ms=on solid archive = on

EXAMPLE 2
       7za a -sfx archive.exe dir1
              add all files from directory "dir1" to SFX archive archive.exe (Remark : SFX  archive  MUST  end  with
              ".exe")

EXAMPLE 3
       7za a -mhe=on -pmy_password archive.7z a_directory
              add  all  files from directory "a_directory" to the archive "archive.7z" (with data and header archive
              encryption on)
