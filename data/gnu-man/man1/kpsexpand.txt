NAME
       kpsetool - script to make teTeX-style kpsetool, kpsexpand, and kpsepath available

SYNOPSIS
       kpsetool  [ OPTIONS... ] COMMAND

       kpsexpand [ OPTIONS... ] STRING

       kpsepath  [ OPTIONS... ] PATHTYPE

DESCRIPTION
       kpsetool  is  a  Bourne  shell  script  that makes a teTeX-style kpsetool, kpsexpand, and kpsepath available.
       kpsetool uses web2c´s (new) kpsexpand binary, so the syntax for kpsexpand is incompatible with teTeX´s as  of
       version 0.4.
