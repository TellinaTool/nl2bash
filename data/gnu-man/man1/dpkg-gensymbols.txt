NAME
       dpkg-gensymbols - generate symbols files (shared library dependency information)

SYNOPSIS
       dpkg-gensymbols [option...]

DESCRIPTION
       dpkg-gensymbols  scans  a  temporary build tree (debian/tmp by default) looking for libraries and generates a
       symbols file describing them. This file, if non-empty, is then installed in the DEBIAN  subdirectory  of  the
       build tree so that it ends up included in the control information of the package.

       When generating those files, it uses as input some symbols files provided by the maintainer. It looks for the
       following files (and uses the first that is found):

       ·   debian/package.symbols.arch

       ·   debian/symbols.arch

       ·   debian/package.symbols

       ·   debian/symbols

       The main interest of those files is to provide the minimal version associated to each symbol provided by  the
       libraries.  Usually  it corresponds to the first version of that package that provided the symbol, but it can
       be manually incremented by the maintainer if the ABI of the symbol is  extended  without  breaking  backwards
       compatibility.  It's  the  responsibility  of the maintainer to keep those files up-to-date and accurate, but
       dpkg-gensymbols helps with that.

       When the generated symbols files differ from the maintainer supplied one, dpkg-gensymbols will print  a  diff
       between  the two versions.  Furthermore if the difference is too significant, it will even fail (you can cus‐
       tomize how much difference you can tolerate, see the -c option).

MAINTAINING SYMBOLS FILES
       The symbols files are really useful only if they  reflect  the  evolution  of  the  package  through  several
       releases. Thus the maintainer has to update them every time that a new symbol is added so that its associated
       minimal version matches reality. To do this properly the diffs contained in the build logs can  be  used.  In
       most  cases, the diff applies directly to the debian/package.symbols file. That said, further tweaks are usu‐
       ally needed: it's recommended for example to drop the Debian revision from the minimal version so that  back‐
       ports with a lower version number but the same upstream version still satisfy the generated dependencies.  If
       the Debian revision can't be dropped because the symbol really got added by the Debian specific change,  then
       one should suffix the version with "~".

       Before applying any patch to the symbols file, the maintainer should double-check that it's sane. Public sym‐
       bols are not supposed to disappear, so the patch should ideally only add new lines.

       Note that you can put comments in symbols files: any line with '#' as the first character is a comment except
       if  it  starts with '#include' (see section Using includes). Lines starting with '#MISSING:' are special com‐
       ments documenting symbols that have disappeared.

   Using #PACKAGE# substitution
       In some rare cases, the name of the library varies between architectures.  To avoid hardcoding  the  name  of
       the  package  in  the symbols file, you can use the marker #PACKAGE#. It will be replaced by the real package
       name during installation of the symbols files. Contrary to the #MINVER# marker, #PACKAGE# will  never  appear
       in a symbols file inside a binary package.

   Using symbol tags
       Symbol  tagging is useful for marking symbols that are special in some way.  Any symbol can have an arbitrary
       number of tags associated with it. While all tags are parsed and stored, only a some of them  are  understood
       by  dpkg-gensymbols and trigger special handling of the symbols. See subsection Standard symbol tags for ref‐
       erence of these tags.

       Tag specification comes right before the symbol name (no whitespace is allowed in between). It always  starts
       with an opening bracket (, ends with a closing bracket ) and must contain at least one tag. Multiple tags are
       separated by the | character. Each tag can optionally have a value which is separated form the  tag  name  by
       the  = character. Tag names and values can be arbitrary strings except they cannot contain any of the special
       ) | = characters. Symbol names following a tag specification can optionally be quoted  with  either  '  or  "
       characters  to  allow whitespaces in them. However, if there are no tags specified for the symbol, quotes are
       treated as part of the symbol name which continues up until the first space.

        (tag1=i am marked|tag name with space)"tagged quoted symbol"@Base 1.0
        (optional)tagged_unquoted_symbol@Base 1.0 1
        untagged_symbol@Base 1.0

       The first symbol in the example is named tagged quoted symbol and has two tags: tag1 with value i  am  marked
       and tag name with space that has no value. The second symbol named tagged_unquoted_symbol is only tagged with
       the tag named optional. The last symbol is an example of the normal untagged symbol.

       Since symbol tags are an extension of the deb-symbols(5) format, they can only be part of the  symbols  files
       used  in  source  packages (those files should then be seen as templates used to build the symbols files that
       are embedded in binary packages). When dpkg-gensymbols is called without the -t option, it will  output  sym‐
       bols  files compatible to the deb-symbols(5) format: it fully processes symbols according to the requirements
       of their standard tags and strips all tags from the output. On the contrary, in template mode (-t)  all  sym‐
       bols and their tags (both standard and unknown ones) are kept in the output and are written in their original
       form as they were loaded.

   Standard symbol tags
       optional
              A symbol marked as optional can disappear from the library at any  time  and  that  will  never  cause
              dpkg-gensymbols  to fail. However, disappeared optional symbols will continuously appear as MISSING in
              the diff in each new package revision.  This behaviour serves as a reminder for  the  maintainer  that
              such  a  symbol  needs to be removed from the symbol file or readded to the library. When the optional
              symbol, which was previously declared as MISSING, suddenly reappears in the next revision, it will  be
              upgraded back to the "existing" status with its minimum version unchanged.

              This  tag is useful for symbols which are private where their disappearance do not cause ABI breakage.
              For example, most of C++ template instantiations fall into this category. Like any other tag, this one
              may also have an arbitrary value: it could be used to indicate why the symbol is considered optional.

       arch=architecture list
              This  tag  allows one to restrict the set of architectures where the symbol is supposed to exist. When
              the symbols list is updated with the symbols discovered in  the  library,  all  arch-specific  symbols
              which  do  not concern the current host architecture are treated as if they did not exist. If an arch-
              specific symbol matching the current host architecture does not exist in the  library,  normal  proce‐
              dures  for  missing  symbols apply and it may cause dpkg-gensymbols to fail. On the other hand, if the
              arch-specific symbol is found when it was not supposed to exist (because the current host architecture
              is  not  listed in the tag), it is made arch neutral (i.e. the arch tag is dropped and the symbol will
              appear in the diff due to this change), but it is not considered as new.

              When operating in the default non-template mode, among arch-specific symbols only those that match the
              current  host architecture are written to the symbols file. On the contrary, all arch-specific symbols
              (including those from foreign arches) are always written to the symbol file when operating in template
              mode.

              The  format of architecture list is the same as the one used in the Build-Depends field of debian/con‐
              trol (except the enclosing square brackets []). For example, the first symbol from the list below will
              be considered only on alpha, any-amd64 and ia64 architectures, the second only on linux architectures,
              while the third one anywhere except on armel.

               (arch=alpha any-amd64 ia64)a_64bit_specific_symbol@Base 1.0
               (arch=linux-any)linux_specific_symbol@Base 1.0
               (arch=!armel)symbol_armel_does_not_have@Base 1.0

       ignore-blacklist
              dpkg-gensymbols has an internal blacklist of symbols that should not appear in symbols files  as  they
              are  usually  only  side-effects  of  implementation details of the toolchain. If for some reason, you
              really want one of those symbols to be included in the symbols file, you should tag  the  symbol  with
              ignore-blacklist. It can be necessary for some low level toolchain libraries like libgcc.

       c++    Denotes c++ symbol pattern. See Using symbol patterns subsection below.

       symver Denotes symver (symbol version) symbol pattern. See Using symbol patterns subsection below.

       regex  Denotes regex symbol pattern. See Using symbol patterns subsection below.

   Using symbol patterns
       Unlike a standard symbol specification, a pattern may cover multiple real symbols from the library. dpkg-gen‐
       symbols will attempt to match each pattern against each real symbol that does  not  have  a  specific  symbol
       counterpart  defined in the symbol file. Whenever the first matching pattern is found, all its tags and prop‐
       erties will be used as a basis specification of the symbol. If none of the patterns matches, the symbol  will
       be considered as new.

       A  pattern  is considered lost if it does not match any symbol in the library. By default this will trigger a
       dpkg-gensymbols failure under -c1 or higher level. However, if the failure is undesired, the pattern  may  be
       marked with the optional tag. Then if the pattern does not match anything, it will only appear in the diff as
       MISSING. Moreover, like any symbol, the pattern may be limited to the specific architectures  with  the  arch
       tag. Please refer to Standard symbol tags subsection above for more information.

       Patterns  are  an  extension of the deb-symbols(5) format hence they are only valid in symbol file templates.
       Pattern specification syntax is not any different from the one of a specific  symbol.  However,  symbol  name
       part  of  the specification serves as an expression to be matched against name@version of the real symbol. In
       order to distinguish among different pattern types, a pattern will typically be tagged with a special tag.

       At the moment, dpkg-gensymbols supports three basic pattern types:

       c++
          This pattern is denoted by the c++ tag. It matches only C++ symbols by their  demangled  symbol  name  (as
          emitted  by c++filt(1) utility). This pattern is very handy for matching symbols which mangled names might
          vary across different architectures while their demangled names remain the same. One group of such symbols
          is  non-virtual  thunks which have architecture specific offsets embedded in their mangled names. A common
          instance of this case is a virtual destructor which under diamond inheritance needs  a  non-virtual  thunk
          symbol.  For  example,  even  if  _ZThn8_N3NSB6ClassDD1Ev@Base  on  32bit  architectures  will probably be
          _ZThn16_N3NSB6ClassDD1Ev@Base on 64bit ones, it can be matched with a single c++ pattern:

          libdummy.so.1 libdummy1 #MINVER#
           [...]
           (c++)"non-virtual thunk to NSB::ClassD::~ClassD()@Base" 1.0
           [...]

          The demangled name above can be obtained by executing the following command:

           $ echo '_ZThn8_N3NSB6ClassDD1Ev@Base' | c++filt

          Please note that while mangled name is unique in the library by definition, this is not  necessarily  true
          for  demangled  names.  A  couple  of distinct real symbols may have the same demangled name. For example,
          that's the case with non-virtual thunk symbols in complex inheritance configurations  or  with  most  con‐
          structors  and  destructors  (since  g++ typically generates two real symbols for them). However, as these
          collisions happen on the ABI level, they should not degrade quality of the symbol file.

       symver
          This pattern is denoted by the symver tag. Well maintained libraries have  versioned  symbols  where  each
          version  corresponds to the upstream version where the symbol got added. If that's the case, you can use a
          symver pattern to match any symbol associated to the specific version. For example:

          libc.so.6 libc6 #MINVER#
           (symver)GLIBC_2.0 2.0
           [...]
           (symver)GLIBC_2.7 2.7
           access@GLIBC_2.0 2.2

          All symbols associated with versions GLIBC_2.0 and GLIBC_2.7 will lead to minimal version of 2.0  and  2.7
          respectively  with  the exception of the symbol access@GLIBC_2.0. The latter will lead to a minimal depen‐
          dency on libc6 version 2.2 despite being in the scope of the "(symver)GLIBC_2.0" pattern because  specific
          symbols take precedence over patterns.

          Please  note  that while old style wildcard patterns (denoted by "*@version" in the symbol name field) are
          still supported, they have been deprecated by new style syntax  "(symver|optional)version".  For  example,
          "*@GLIBC_2.0 2.0" should be written as "(symver|optional)GLIBC_2.0 2.0" if the same behaviour is needed.

       regex
          Regular expression patterns are denoted by the regex tag. They match by the perl regular expression speci‐
          fied in the symbol name field. A regular expression is matched as it is, therefore do not forget to  start
          it with the ^ character or it may match any part of the real symbol name@version string. For example:

          libdummy.so.1 libdummy1 #MINVER#
           (regex)"^mystack_.*@Base$" 1.0
           (regex|optional)"private" 1.0

          Symbols  like  "mystack_new@Base",  "mystack_push@Base",  "mystack_pop@Base"  etc.  will be matched by the
          first pattern while e.g. "ng_mystack_new@Base" won't.  The second pattern will match  all  symbols  having
          the string "private" in their names and matches will inherit optional tag from the pattern.

       Basic  patterns  listed  above  can be combined where it makes sense. In that case, they are processed in the
       order in which the tags are specified. For example, both

        (c++|regex)"^NSA::ClassA::Private::privmethod\d\(int\)@Base" 1.0
        (regex|c++)N3NSA6ClassA7Private11privmethod\dEi@Base 1.0

       will     match     symbols     "_ZN3NSA6ClassA7Private11privmethod1Ei@Base"     and      "_ZN3NSA6ClassA7Pri‐
       vate11privmethod2Ei@Base".  When matching the first pattern, the raw symbol is first demangled as C++ symbol,
       then the demangled name is matched against the regular expression. On the other hand, when matching the  sec‐
       ond  pattern,  regular  expression is matched against the raw symbol name, then the symbol is tested if it is
       C++ one by attempting to demangle it. A failure of any basic pattern will result in the failure of the  whole
       pattern.   Therefore, for example, "__N3NSA6ClassA7Private11privmethod\dEi@Base" will not match either of the
       patterns because it is not a valid C++ symbol.

       In general, all patterns are divided into two groups: aliases (basic c++ and  symver)  and  generic  patterns
       (regex,  all  combinations of multiple basic patterns). Matching of basic alias-based patterns is fast (O(1))
       while generic patterns are O(N) (N - generic pattern count) for each symbol.  Therefore,  it  is  recommended
       not to overuse generic patterns.

       When  multiple  patterns  match  the  same  real  symbol, aliases (first c++, then symver) are preferred over
       generic patterns. Generic patterns are matched in the order they are found in the symbol file template  until
       the  first success.  Please note, however, that manual reordering of template file entries is not recommended
       because dpkg-gensymbols generates diffs based on the alphanumerical order of their names.

   Using includes
       When the set of exported symbols differ between architectures, it may become inefficient to use a single sym‐
       bol file. In those cases, an include directive may prove to be useful in a couple of ways:

       ·   You  can  factorize  the  common  part  in  some external file and include that file in your package.sym‐
           bols.arch file by using an include directive like this:

           #include "packages.symbols.common"

       ·   The include directive may also be tagged like any symbol:

           (tag|...|tagN)#include "file-to-include"

           As a result, all symbols included from file-to-include will be considered to be tagged with tag ...  tagN
           by  default. You can use this feature to create a common package.symbols file which includes architecture
           specific symbol files:

             common_symbol1@Base 1.0
            (arch=amd64 ia64 alpha)#include "package.symbols.64bit"
            (arch=!amd64 !ia64 !alpha)#include "package.symbols.32bit"
             common_symbol2@Base 1.0

       The symbols files are read line by line, and include directives are processed as soon  as  they  are  encoun‐
       tered.  This  means  that  the content of the included file can override any content that appeared before the
       include directive and that any content after the directive can override anything contained  in  the  included
       file.  Any  symbol  (or  even another #include directive) in the included file can specify additional tags or
       override values of the inherited tags in its tag specification. However, there is no way for  the  symbol  to
       remove any of the inherited tags.

       An  included file can repeat the header line containing the SONAME of the library. In that case, it overrides
       any header line previously read.  However, in general it's best to avoid duplicating header lines. One way to
       do it is the following:

       #include "libsomething1.symbols.common"
        arch_specific_symbol@Base 1.0

   Good library management
       A well-maintained library has the following features:

       ·   its  API  is  stable (public symbols are never dropped, only new public symbols are added) and changes in
           incompatible ways only when the SONAME changes;

       ·   ideally, it uses symbol versioning to achieve ABI stability despite internal changes and API extension;

       ·   it doesn't export private symbols (such symbols can be tagged optional as workaround).

       While maintaining the symbols file, it's easy to notice appearance and disappearance  of  symbols.  But  it's
       more  difficult  to  catch  incompatible  API  and ABI change. Thus the maintainer should read thoroughly the
       upstream changelog looking for cases where the rules of good library management have been broken.  If  poten‐
       tial problems are discovered, the upstream author should be notified as an upstream fix is always better than
       a Debian specific work-around.

OPTIONS
       -Ppackage-build-dir
              Scan package-build-dir instead of debian/tmp.

       -ppackage
              Define the package name. Required if more than one binary package is listed in debian/control  (or  if
              there's no debian/control file).

       -vversion
              Define  the  package  version.  Defaults  to  the version extracted from debian/changelog. Required if
              called outside of a source package tree.

       -elibrary-file
              Only analyze libraries explicitly listed instead of finding all public libraries. You  can  use  shell
              patterns  used for pathname expansions (see the File::Glob(3perl) manual page for details) in library-
              file to match multiple libraries with a single argument (otherwise you need multiple -e).

       -Ifilename
              Use filename as reference file to generate the symbols file that is integrated in the package itself.

       -O[filename]
              Print the generated symbols file to standard output or  to  filename  if  specified,  rather  than  to
              debian/tmp/DEBIAN/symbols  (or  package-build-dir/DEBIAN/symbols  if -P was used). If filename is pre-
              existing, its contents are used as basis for the generated symbols file.  You can use this feature  to
              update a symbols file so that it matches a newer upstream version of your library.

       -t     Write the symbol file in template mode rather than the format compatible with deb-symbols(5). The main
              difference is that in the template mode symbol names and tags are written in their original form  con‐
              trary to the post-processed symbol names with tags stripped in the compatibility mode.  Moreover, some
              symbols might be omitted when writing a standard deb-symbols(5) file (according to the tag  processing
              rules) while all symbols are always written to the symbol file template.

       -c[0-4]
              Define  the  checks  to  do  when  comparing the generated symbols file with the template file used as
              starting point. By default the level is 1. Increasing levels do more checks and include all checks  of
              lower  levels.  Level  0 never fails. Level 1 fails if some symbols have disappeared. Level 2 fails if
              some new symbols have been introduced. Level 3 fails if some libraries have disappeared. Level 4 fails
              if some libraries have been introduced.

              This value can be overridden by the environment variable DPKG_GENSYMBOLS_CHECK_LEVEL.

       -q     Keep  quiet  and  never  generate  a diff between generated symbols file and the template file used as
              starting point or show any warnings about new/lost libraries or new/lost  symbols.  This  option  only
              disables informational output but not the checks themselves (see -c option).

       -aarch Assume  arch  as  host architecture when processing symbol files. Use this option to generate a symbol
              file or diff for any architecture provided its binaries are already available.

       -d     Enable debug mode. Numerous messages are displayed to explain what dpkg-gensymbols does.

       -V     Enable verbose mode. The generated symbols file contains deprecated symbols as  comments.  Furthermore
              in  template mode, pattern symbols are followed by comments listing real symbols that have matched the
              pattern.

       -?, --help
              Show the usage message and exit.

       --version
              Show the version and exit.
