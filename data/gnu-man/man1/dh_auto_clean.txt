NAME
       dh_auto_clean - automatically cleans up after a build

SYNOPSIS
       dh_auto_clean [build system options] [debhelper options] [-- params]

DESCRIPTION
       dh_auto_clean is a debhelper program that tries to automatically clean up after a package build. It does so
       by running the appropriate command for the build system it detects the package uses. For example, if there's
       a Makefile and it contains a distclean, realclean, or clean target, then this is done by running make (or
       MAKE, if the environment variable is set). If there is a setup.py or Build.PL, it is run to clean the
       package.

       This is intended to work for about 90% of packages. If it doesn't work, or tries to use the wrong clean
       target, you're encouraged to skip using dh_auto_clean at all, and just run make clean manually.

OPTIONS
       See "BUILD SYSTEM OPTIONS" in debhelper(7) for a list of common build system selection and control options.

       -- params
           Pass params to the program that is run, after the parameters that dh_auto_clean usually passes.

SEE ALSO
