NAME
       config - OpenSSL CONF library configuration files

DESCRIPTION
       The OpenSSL CONF library can be used to read configuration files.  It is used for the OpenSSL master
       configuration file openssl.cnf and in a few other places like SPKAC files and certificate extension files for
       the x509 utility. OpenSSL applications can also use the CONF library for their own purposes.

       A configuration file is divided into a number of sections. Each section starts with a line [ section_name ]
       and ends when a new section is started or end of file is reached. A section name can consist of alphanumeric
       characters and underscores.

       The first section of a configuration file is special and is referred to as the default section this is
       usually unnamed and is from the start of file until the first named section. When a name is being looked up
       it is first looked up in a named section (if any) and then the default section.

       The environment is mapped onto a section called ENV.

       Comments can be included by preceding them with the # character

       Each section in a configuration file consists of a number of name and value pairs of the form name=value

       The name string can contain any alphanumeric characters as well as a few punctuation symbols such as . , ;
       and _.

       The value string consists of the string following the = character until end of line with any leading and
       trailing white space removed.

       The value string undergoes variable expansion. This can be done by including the form $var or ${var}: this
       will substitute the value of the named variable in the current section. It is also possible to substitute a
       value from another section using the syntax $section::name or ${section::name}. By using the form $ENV::name
       environment variables can be substituted. It is also possible to assign values to environment variables by
       using the name ENV::name, this will work if the program looks up environment variables using the CONF library
       instead of calling getenv() directly.

       It is possible to escape certain characters by using any kind of quote or the \ character. By making the last
       character of a line a \ a value string can be spread across multiple lines. In addition the sequences \n, \r,
       \b and \t are recognized.

OPENSSL LIBRARY CONFIGURATION
       In OpenSSL 0.9.7 and later applications can automatically configure certain aspects of OpenSSL using the
       master OpenSSL configuration file, or optionally an alternative configuration file. The openssl utility
       includes this functionality: any sub command uses the master OpenSSL configuration file unless an option is
       used in the sub command to use an alternative configuration file.

       To enable library configuration the default section needs to contain an appropriate line which points to the
       main configuration section. The default name is openssl_conf which is used by the openssl utility. Other
       applications may use an alternative name such as myapplicaton_conf.

       The configuration section should consist of a set of name value pairs which contain specific module
       configuration information. The name represents the name of the configuration module the meaning of the value
       is module specific: it may, for example, represent a further configuration section containing configuration
       module specific information. E.g.

        openssl_conf = openssl_init

        [openssl_init]

        oid_section = new_oids
        engines = engine_section

        [new_oids]

        ... new oids here ...

        [engine_section]

        ... engine stuff here ...

       Currently there are two configuration modules. One for ASN1 objects another for ENGINE configuration.

   ASN1 OBJECT CONFIGURATION MODULE
       This module has the name oid_section. The value of this variable points to a section containing name value
       pairs of OIDs: the name is the OID short and long name, the value is the numerical form of the OID. Although
       some of the openssl utility sub commands already have their own ASN1 OBJECT section functionality not all do.
       By using the ASN1 OBJECT configuration module all the openssl utility sub commands can see the new objects as
       well as any compliant applications. For example:

        [new_oids]

        some_new_oid = 1.2.3.4
        some_other_oid = 1.2.3.5

       In OpenSSL 0.9.8 it is also possible to set the value to the long name followed by a comma and the numerical
       OID form. For example:

        shortName = some object long name, 1.2.3.4

   ENGINE CONFIGURATION MODULE
       This ENGINE configuration module has the name engines. The value of this variable points to a section
       containing further ENGINE configuration information.

       The section pointed to by engines is a table of engine names (though see engine_id below) and further
       sections containing configuration information specific to each ENGINE.

       Each ENGINE specific section is used to set default algorithms, load dynamic, perform initialization and send
       ctrls. The actual operation performed depends on the command name which is the name of the name value pair.
       The currently supported commands are listed below.

       For example:

        [engine_section]

        # Configure ENGINE named "foo"
        foo = foo_section
        # Configure ENGINE named "bar"
        bar = bar_section

        [foo_section]
        ... foo ENGINE specific commands ...

        [bar_section]
        ... "bar" ENGINE specific commands ...

       The command engine_id is used to give the ENGINE name. If used this command must be first. For example:

        [engine_section]
        # This would normally handle an ENGINE named "foo"
        foo = foo_section

        [foo_section]
        # Override default name and use "myfoo" instead.
        engine_id = myfoo

       The command dynamic_path loads and adds an ENGINE from the given path. It is equivalent to sending the ctrls
       SO_PATH with the path argument followed by LIST_ADD with value 2 and LOAD to the dynamic ENGINE. If this is
       not the required behaviour then alternative ctrls can be sent directly to the dynamic ENGINE using ctrl
       commands.

       The command init determines whether to initialize the ENGINE. If the value is 0 the ENGINE will not be
       initialized, if 1 and attempt it made to initialized the ENGINE immediately. If the init command is not
       present then an attempt will be made to initialize the ENGINE after all commands in its section have been
       processed.

       The command default_algorithms sets the default algorithms an ENGINE will supply using the functions
       ENGINE_set_default_string()

       If the name matches none of the above command names it is assumed to be a ctrl command which is sent to the
       ENGINE. The value of the command is the argument to the ctrl command. If the value is the string EMPTY then
       no value is sent to the command.

       For example:

        [engine_section]

        # Configure ENGINE named "foo"
        foo = foo_section

        [foo_section]
        # Load engine from DSO
        dynamic_path = /some/path/fooengine.so
        # A foo specific ctrl.
        some_ctrl = some_value
        # Another ctrl that doesn't take a value.
        other_ctrl = EMPTY
        # Supply all default algorithms
        default_algorithms = ALL

NOTES
       If a configuration file attempts to expand a variable that doesn't exist then an error is flagged and the
       file will not load. This can happen if an attempt is made to expand an environment variable that doesn't
       exist. For example in a previous version of OpenSSL the default OpenSSL master configuration file used the
       value of HOME which may not be defined on non Unix systems and would cause an error.

       This can be worked around by including a default section to provide a default value: then if the environment
       lookup fails the default value will be used instead. For this to work properly the default value must be
       defined earlier in the configuration file than the expansion. See the EXAMPLES section for an example of how
       to do this.

       If the same variable exists in the same section then all but the last value will be silently ignored. In
       certain circumstances such as with DNs the same field may occur multiple times. This is usually worked around
       by ignoring any characters before an initial . e.g.

        1.OU="My first OU"
        2.OU="My Second OU"

EXAMPLES
       Here is a sample configuration file using some of the features mentioned above.

        # This is the default section.

        HOME=/temp
        RANDFILE= ${ENV::HOME}/.rnd
        configdir=$ENV::HOME/config

        [ section_one ]

        # We are now in section one.

        # Quotes permit leading and trailing whitespace
        any = " any variable name "

        other = A string that can \
        cover several lines \
        by including \\ characters

        message = Hello World\n

        [ section_two ]

        greeting = $section_one::message

       This next example shows how to expand environment variables safely.

       Suppose you want a variable called tmpfile to refer to a temporary filename. The directory it is placed in
       can determined by the the TEMP or TMP environment variables but they may not be set to any value at all. If
       you just include the environment variable names and the variable doesn't exist then this will cause an error
       when an attempt is made to load the configuration file. By making use of the default section both values can
       be looked up with TEMP taking priority and /tmp used if neither is defined:

        TMP=/tmp
        # The above value is used if TMP isn't in the environment
        TEMP=$ENV::TMP
        # The above value is used if TEMP isn't in the environment
        tmpfile=${ENV::TEMP}/tmp.filename

BUGS
       Currently there is no way to include characters using the octal \nnn form. Strings are all null terminated so
       nulls cannot form part of the value.

       The escaping isn't quite right: if you want to use sequences like \n you can't use any quote escaping on the
       same line.

       Files are loaded in a single pass. This means that an variable expansion will only work if the variables
       referenced are defined earlier in the file.
