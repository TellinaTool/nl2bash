NAME
       gio-querymodules - GIO module cache creation

SYNOPSIS
       gio-querymodules {DIRECTORY...}

DESCRIPTION
       gio-querymodules creates a giomodule.cache file in the listed directories. This file lists the implemented
       extension points for each module that has been found. It is used by GIO at runtime to avoid opening all
       modules just to find out which extension points they are implementing.

       GIO modules are usually installed in the gio/modules subdirectory of libdir.
