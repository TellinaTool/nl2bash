PCRE-CONFIG(1)                                 General Commands Manual                                PCRE-CONFIG(1)



NAME
       pcre-config - program to return PCRE configuration

SYNOPSIS
       pcre-config [--prefix] [--exec-prefix] [--version] [--libs] [--libs-posix] [--cflags] [--cflags-posix]


DESCRIPTION
       pcre-config returns the configuration of the installed PCRE libraries: the options required to compile a pro‐
       gram to use them.


OPTIONS
       --prefix  Writes the directory prefix used in the PCRE installation for architecture independent files  (e.g.
                 /usr) to standard output.

       --exec-prefix
                 Writes  the  directory  prefix used in the PCRE installation for architecture dependent files (nor‐
                 mally the same as --prefix) to standard output.

       --version Writes the version of PCRE installed to standard output.

       --libs    Writes to standard output the command line options required to link with PCRE (e.g. -lpcre).

       --libs-posix
                 Writes to standard output the command line options required to link with the PCRE  POSIX  emulation
                 library (e.g. -lpcreposix -lpcre).

       --cflags  Writes  to  standard  output the command line options required to compile files that use PCRE (this
                 often includes some -I options, but is blank on debian systems).

       --cflags-posix
                 Writes to standard output the command line options required to compile  files  that  use  the  PCRE
                 POSIX emulation library (this often includes some -I options, but is blank on debian systems). Sup‐
                 press printing of filenames when searching multiple files.
