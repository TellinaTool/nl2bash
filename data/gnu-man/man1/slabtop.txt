SLABTOP(1)                                          User Commands                                         SLABTOP(1)



NAME
       slabtop - display kernel slab cache information in real time

SYNOPSIS
       slabtop [options]

DESCRIPTION
       slabtop  displays  detailed  kernel  slab  cache  information in real time.  It displays a listing of the top
       caches sorted by one of the listed sort criteria.  It also displays a  statistics  header  filled  with  slab
       layer information.

OPTIONS
       Normal invocation of slabtop does not require any options.  The behavior, however, can be fine-tuned by spec‐
       ifying one or more of the following flags:

       -d, --delay=N
              Refresh the display every n in seconds.  By default, slabtop refreshes the display  every  three  sec‐
              onds.  To exit the program, hit q.

       -s, --sort=S
              Sort by S, where S is one of the sort criteria.

       -o, --once
              Display the output once and then exit.

       -V, --version
              Display version information and exit.

       -h, --help
              Display usage information and exit.

SORT CRITERIA
       The  following are valid sort criteria used to sort the individual slab caches and thereby determine what are
       the "top" slab caches to display.  The default sort criteria is to sort by the number of objects ("o").

       The sort criteria can also be changed while slabtop is running by pressing the associated character.

       character   description                header
       a           number of active objects   ACTIVE
       b           objects per slab           OBJ/SLAB
       c           cache size                 CACHE SIZE
       l           number of slabs            SLABS
       v           number of active slabs     N/A
       n           name                       NAME
       o           number of objects          OBJS
       p           pages per slab             N/A
       s           object size                OBJ SIZE
       u           cache utilization          USE

COMMANDS
       slabtop accepts keyboard commands from the user during use.  The following are supported.   In  the  case  of
       letters, both cases are accepted.

       Each  of the valid sort characters are also accepted, to change the sort routine. See the section SORT CRITE‐
       RIA.

       <SPACEBAR>
              Refresh the screen.

       Q      Quit the program.

FILES
       /proc/slabinfo
              slab information

SEE ALSO
       free(1), ps(1), top(1), vmstat(8)

NOTES
       Currently, slabtop requires a 2.4 or later kernel (specifically, a  version  1.1  or  later  /proc/slabinfo).
       Kernel 2.2 should be supported in the future.

       The slabtop statistic header is tracking how many bytes of slabs are being used and it not a measure of phys‐
       ical memory.  The 'Slab' field in the /proc/meminfo file is tracking information  about  used  slab  physical
       memory.
