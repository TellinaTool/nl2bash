READPROFILE(1)                                      User Commands                                     READPROFILE(1)



NAME
       readprofile - read kernel profiling information

SYNOPSIS
       readprofile [options]


VERSION
       This manpage documents version 2.0 of the program.


DESCRIPTION
       The  readprofile command uses the /proc/profile information to print ascii data on standard output.  The out‐
       put is organized in three columns: the first is the number of clock ticks, the second is the name  of  the  C
       function  in the kernel where those many ticks occurred, and the third is the normalized `load' of the proce‐
       dure, calculated as a ratio between the number of ticks and the length of the procedure. The output is filled
       with blanks to ease readability.


       Available command line options are the following:


       -m mapfile
              Specify  a mapfile, which by default is /usr/src/linux/System.map.  You should specify the map file on
              cmdline if your current kernel isn't the last one you compiled, or if you keep  System.map  elsewhere.
              If the name of the map file ends with `.gz' it is decompressed on the fly.


       -p pro-file
              Specify  a  different profiling buffer, which by default is /proc/profile.  Using a different pro-file
              is useful if you want to `freeze' the kernel profiling at some time and read it later. The  /proc/pro‐
              file  file can be copied using `cat' or `cp'. There is no more support for compressed profile buffers,
              like in readprofile-1.1, because the program needs to know the size of the buffer in advance.


       -i     Info. This makes readprofile only print the profiling step used by the kernel.  The profiling step  is
              the  resolution of the profiling buffer, and is chosen during kernel configuration (through `make con‐
              fig'), or in the kernel's command line.  If the -t (terse) switch is used together with  -i  only  the
              decimal number is printed.


       -a     Print all symbols in the mapfile. By default the procedures with 0 reported ticks are not printed.


       -b     Print individual histogram-bin counts.


       -r     Reset  the  profiling  buffer.  This can only be invoked by root, because /proc/profile is readable by
              everybody but writable only by the superuser. However, you can make readprofile setuid 0, in order  to
              reset the buffer without gaining privileges.


       -M multiplier
              On  some  architectures  it  is possible to alter the frequency at which the kernel delivers profiling
              interrupts to each CPU.  This option allows you to set the frequency, as a multiplier  of  the  system
              clock  frequency,  HZ.   This  is supported on i386-SMP (2.2 and 2.4 kernel) and also on sparc-SMP and
              sparc64-SMP (2.4 kernel).  This option also resets the profiling buffer, and requires superuser privi‐
              leges.


       -v     Verbose.  The output is organized in four columns and filled with blanks.  The first column is the RAM
              address of a kernel function, the second is the name of the function, the third is the number of clock
              ticks and the last is the normalized load.


       -V     Version. This makes readprofile print its version number and exit.


EXAMPLES
       Browse the profiling buffer ordering by clock ticks:
          readprofile | sort -nr | less

       Print the 20 most loaded procedures:
          readprofile | sort -nr +2 | head -20

       Print only filesystem profile:
          readprofile | grep _ext2

       Look at all the kernel information, with ram addresses"
          readprofile -av | less

       Browse a `freezed' profile buffer for a non current kernel:
          readprofile -p ~/profile.freeze -m /zImage.map.gz

       Request profiling at 2kHz per CPU, and reset the profiling buffer
          sudo readprofile -M 20



BUGS
       readprofile  only  works with an 1.3.x or newer kernel, because /proc/profile changed in the step from 1.2 to
       1.3


       This program only works with ELF kernels. The change for a.out kernels is trivial, and left as an exercise to
       the a.out user.


       To  enable  profiling, the kernel must be rebooted, because no profiling module is available, and it wouldn't
       be easy to build. To enable profiling, you can specify "profile=2" (or another number) on the kernel command‐
       line.  The number you specify is the two-exponent used as profiling step.


       Profiling  is disabled when interrupts are inhibited. This means that many profiling ticks happen when inter‐
       rupts are re-enabled. Watch out for misleading information.


FILES
       /proc/profile              A binary snapshot of the profiling buffer.
       /usr/src/linux/System.map  The symbol table for the kernel.
       /usr/src/linux/*           The program being profiled :-)


AVAILABILITY
       The  readprofile  command  is  part  of  the  util-linux  package  and  is  available   from   ftp://ftp.ker‐
       nel.org/pub/linux/utils/util-linux/.
