DCONF-SERVICE(1)                                    User Commands                                   DCONF-SERVICE(1)



NAME
       dconf-service - D-Bus service for writes to the dconf database

SYNOPSIS
       dconf-service

DESCRIPTION
       The dconf-service program provides the ca.desrt.dconf name on the session or system bus. Users or
       administrators should never need to start the service, as it will be automatically started by dbus-daemon(1)
       whenever an application tries to write settings.

       Reading values from the dconf database does not involve the service; it is only needed for writes. The
       service is stateless and can exit freely at any time (and is therefore robust against crashes).
