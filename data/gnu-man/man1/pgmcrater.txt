NAME
       pgmcrater - create cratered terrain by fractal forgery

SYNOPSIS
       pgmcrater [-number n] [-height|-ysize s] [-width|-xsize s] [-gamma g]

       All options can be abbreviated to their shortest unique prefix.



DESCRIPTION
       pgmcrater  creates  a  PGM  image  which mimics cratered terrain.  The PGM image is created by simulating the
       impact of a given number of craters with random position and size, then rendering the resulting terrain  ele‐
       vations based on a light source shining from one side of the screen.  The size distribution of the craters is
       based on a power law which results in many more small craters than large ones.  The number of  craters  of  a
       given  size  varies  as  the  reciprocal of the area as described on pages 31 and 32 of Peitgen and Saupe[1];
       cratered bodies in the Solar System are observed to obey this  relationship.   The  formula  used  to  obtain
       crater  radii  governed  by this law from a uniformly distributed pseudorandom sequence was developed by Rudy
       Rucker.

       High resolution images with large numbers of craters often benefit from being piped through  pnmsmooth.   The
       averaging  performed  by  this  process  eliminates some of the jagged pixels and lends a mellow ``telescopic
       image'' feel to the overall picture.

       pgmcrater simulates only small craters, which are hemispherical in shape (regardless of the  incidence  angle
       of  the impacting body, as long as the velocity is sufficiently high).  Large craters, such as Copernicus and
       Tycho on the Moon, have a ``walled plain'' shape with a cross-section more like:
                       /\                            /\
                 _____/  \____________/\____________/  \_____
       Larger craters should really use this profile, including the central peak, and totally  obliterate  the  pre-
       existing terrain.


OPTIONS
       -number n Causes n craters to be generated.  If no -number specification is given, 50000 craters will be gen‐
                 erated.  Don't expect to see them all!  For every large crater there are many, many more tiny  ones
                 which  tend simply to erode the landscape.  In general, the more craters you specify the more real‐
                 istic the result; ideally you want the entire terrain to have been extensively  turned  over  again
                 and again by cratering.  High resolution images containing five to ten million craters are stunning
                 but take quite a while to create.

       -height height
                 Sets the height of the generated image to height pixels.  The default height is 256 pixels.

       -width width
                 Sets the width of the generated image to width pixels.  The default width is 256 pixels.

       -xsize width
                 Sets the width of the generated image to width pixels.  The default width is 256 pixels.

       -ysize height
                 Sets the height of the generated image to height pixels.  The default height is 256 pixels.

       -gamma factor
                 The specified factor is used to gamma adjust the image in the same manner as performed by pnmgamma.
                 The  default  value is 1.0, which results in a medium contrast image.  Values larger than 1 lighten
                 the image and reduce contrast, while values less than 1 darken the image, increasing contrast.

                 Note that this is separate from the gamma correction that is part of the definition of the PGM for‐
                 mat.   The  image  pnmgamma  generates  is  a genuine, gamma-corrected PGM image in any case.  This
                 option simply changes the contrast and may compensate for a display device that does not  correctly
                 render PGM images.


DESIGN NOTES
       The -gamma option isn't really necessary since you can achieve the same effect by piping the output from pgm‐
       crater through pnmgamma.  However, pgmcrater performs an internal gamma map anyway in the process of  render‐
       ing  the  elevation  array  into  the PGM format, so there's no additional overhead in allowing an additional
       gamma adjustment.

       Real craters have two distinct morphologies.
