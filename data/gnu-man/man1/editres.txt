EDITRES(1)                                     General Commands Manual                                    EDITRES(1)



NAME
       editres - a dynamic resource editor for X Toolkit applications

SYNTAX
       editres [ -toolkitoption ... ]

OPTIONS
       Editres accepts all of the standard X Toolkit command line options (see X(7)).  The order of the command line
       options is not important.

DESCRIPTION
       Editres is a tool that allows users and application developers to view the full widget  hierarchy  of  any  X
       Toolkit  application  that  speaks  the  Editres protocol.  In addition, editres will help the user construct
       resource specifications, allow the user to apply the resource to the application and view the results dynami‐
       cally.   Once  the user is happy with a resource specification editres will append the resource string to the
       user's X Resources file.

USING EDITRES
       Editres provides a window consisting of the following four areas:

       Menu Bar                 A set of popup menus that allow you full access to editres's features.

       Panner                   The panner allows a more intuitive way to scroll the application tree display.

       Message Area             Displays information to the user about the action that editres expects of her.

       Application Widget Tree  This area will be used to display the selected application's widget tree.

       To begin an editres session select the Get Widget Tree menu item from the command menu.  This will change the
       pointer  cursor  to cross hair.  You should now select the application you wish look at by clicking on any of
       its windows.  If this application understands the editres protocol then editres  will  display  the  applica‐
       tion's  widget  tree in its tree window.  If the application does not understand the editres protocol editres
       will inform you of this fact in the message area after a few seconds delay.

       Once you have a widget tree you may now select any of the other menu options. The effect of each of these  is
       described below.

COMMANDS
       Get Widget Tree
               Allows  the  user to click on any application that speaks the editres protocol and receive its widget
               tree.

       Refresh Current Widget Tree
               Editres only knows about the widgets that exist at the present time.  Many  applications  create  and
               destroy  widgets  on  the fly.  Selecting this menu item will cause editres to ask the application to
               resend its widget tree, thus updating its information to the new state of the application.

               For example, xman only creates the widgets for its topbox when it starts up.  None of the widgets for
               the  manual page window are created until the user actually clicks on the Manual Page button.  If you
               retrieved xman's widget tree before the the manual page is active, you may wish to refresh the widget
               tree  after  the  manual page has been displayed.  This will allow you to also edit the manual page's
               resources.

       Dump Widget Tree to a File
               For documenting applications it is often useful to be able to dump the entire application widget tree
               to  an  ASCII  file.   This  file  can  then  be included in the manual page.  When this menu item is
               selected a popup dialog is activated.  Type the name of the file in this dialog,  and  either  select
               okay,  or type a carriage-return.  Editres will now dump the widget tree to this file.  To cancel the
               file dialog, select the cancel button.

       Show Resource Box
               This command will popup a resource box for the current application.  This resource box (described  in
               detail  below)  will  allow the user to see exactly which resources can be set for the widget that is
               currently selected in the widget tree display.  Only one widget may be currently selected; if greater
               or  fewer are selected editres will refuse to pop up the resource box and put an error message in the
               Message Area.

       Set Resource
               This command will popup a simple dialog box for setting an arbitrary resource on  all  selected  wid‐
               gets.   You  must type in the resource name, as well as the value.  You can use the Tab key to switch
               between the resource name field the resource value field.

       Quit    Exits editres.

TREE COMMANDS
       The Tree menu contains several commands that allow operations to be performed on the widget tree.

       Select Widget in Client
              This menu item allows you to select any widget in the application; editres  will  then  highlight  the
              corresponding  element  the  widget  tree display.  Once this menu item is selected the pointer cursor
              will again turn to a crosshair, and you must click any pointer button in the widget you wish  to  have
              displayed.   Since  some  widgets  are  fully obscured by their children, it is not possible to get to
              every widget this way, but this mechanism does give very useful feedback between the elements  in  the
              widget tree and those in the actual application.

       Select All

       Unselect All

       Invert All
              These functions allow the user to select, unselect, or invert all widgets in the widget tree.

       Select Children

       Select Parents
              These functions select the immediate parent or children of each of the currently selected widgets.

       Select Descendants

       Select Ancestors
              These  functions  select all parents or children of each of the currently selected widgets.  This is a
              recursive search.

       Show Widget Names

       Show Class Names

       Show Widget IDs

       Show Widget Windows
              When the tree widget is initially displayed the labels of each widget in the tree  correspond  to  the
              widget  names.   These functions will cause the label of all widgets in the tree to be changed to show
              the class name, IDs, or window associated with each widget in the application.  The  widget  IDs,  and
              windows are shown as hex numbers.

       In  addition  there are keyboard accelerators for each of the Tree operations.  If the input focus is over an
       individual widget in the tree, then that operation will only effect that widget.  If the input  focus  is  in
       the Tree background it will have exactly the same effect as the corresponding menu item.

       The  translation entries shown may be applied to any widget in the application.  If that widget is a child of
       the Tree widget, then it will only affect that widget, otherwise it will have the same effect as the commands
       in the tree menu.

       Flash Active Widgets
              This  command is the inverse of the Select Widget in Client command, it will show the user each widget
              that is currently selected in the widget tree, by flashing the corresponding widget in the application
              numFlashes (three by default) times in the flashColor.



              Key     Option                     Translation Entry
              -
              space   Unselect                   Select(nothing)
              w       Select                     Select(widget)
              s       Select                     Select(all)
              i       Invert                     Select(invert)
              c       Select Children            Select(children)
              d       Select Descendants         Select(descendants)
              p       Select Parent              Select(parent)
              a       Select Ancestors           Select(ancestors)
              N       Show Widget Names          Relabel(name)
              C       Show Class Names           Relabel(class)
              I       Show Widget IDs            Relabel(id)
              W       Show Widget Windows        Relabel(window)
              T       Toggle Widget/Class Name   Relabel(toggle)

              Clicking  button  1 on a widget adds it to the set of selected widgets.  Clicking button 2 on a widget
              deselects all other widgets and then selects just that widget.  Clicking button 3 on a widget  toggles
              its label between the widget's instance name the widget's class name.


USING THE RESOURCE BOX
       The resource box contains five different areas.  Each of the areas, as they appear on the screen, from top to
       bottom will be discussed.

       The Resource Line
              This area at the top of the resource box shows the current resource name exactly as it would appear if
              you were to save it to a file or apply it.

       The Widget Names and Classes
              This  area  allows you to select exactly which widgets this resource will apply to.  The area contains
              four lines, the first contains the name of the selected widget and all its  ancestors,  and  the  more
              restrictive dot (.) separator.  The second line contains less specific the Class names of each widget,
              and well as the less restrictive star (*) separator.  The third line contains a set of special buttons
              called  Any Widget which will generalize this level to match any widget.  The last line contains a set
              of special buttons called Any Widget Chain which will  turn  the  single  level  into  something  that
              matches zero or more levels.

              The  initial  state of this area is the most restrictive, using the resource names and the dot separa‐
              tor.  By selecting the other buttons in this area you can ease the restrictions to allow more and more
              widgets  to  match the specification.  The extreme case is to select all the Any Widget Chain buttons,
              which will match every widget in the application.   As you select different buttons the  tree  display
              will update to show you exactly which widgets will be effected by the current resource specification.

       Normal and Constraint Resources
              The  next  area  allows  you to select the name of the normal or constraint resources you wish to set.
              Some widgets may not have constraint resources, so that area will not appear.

       Resource Value
              This next area allows you to enter the resource value.  This value should be entered  exactly  as  you
              would  type a line into your resource file.  Thus it should contain no unescaped new-lines.  There are
              a few special character sequences for this file:

              \n - This will be replaced with a newline.

              \### - Where # is any octal digit.  This will be replaced  with  a  single  byte  that  contains  this
              sequence interpreted as an octal number.  For example, a value containing a NULL byte can be stored by
              specifying \000.

              \<new-line> - This will compress to nothing.

              \\ - This will compress to a single backslash.

       Command Area
              This area contains several command buttons, described in this section.

       Set Save File
              This button allows the user to modify file that the resources will be  saved  to.   This  button  will
              bring up a dialog box that will ask you for a filename; once the filename has been entered, either hit
              carriage-return or click on the okay button.  To pop down the dialog box  without  changing  the  save
              file, click the cancel button.

       Save   This  button will append the resource line described above to the end of the current save file.  If no
              save file has been set the Set Save File dialog box will be popped up to prompt the user for  a  file‐
              name.

       Apply  This  button  attempts  to  perform  a  XtSetValues  call  on all widgets that match the resource line
              described above.  The value specified is applied directly to all matching widgets.  This  behavior  is
              an  attempt  to give a dynamic feel to the resource editor.  Since this feature allows users to put an
              application in states it may not be willing to handle, a hook has  been  provided  to  allow  specific
              applications to block these SetValues requests (see Blocking Editres Requests below).

              Unfortunately  due to design constraints imposed on the widgets by the X Toolkit and the Resource Man‐
              ager, trying to coerce an inherently static system into dynamic behavior can  cause  strange  results.
              There  is no guarantee that the results of an apply will be the same as what will happen when you save
              the value and restart the application.  This functionality is provided to try to give you a rough feel
              for  what your changes will accomplish, and the results obtained should be considered suspect at best.
              Having said that, this is one of the neatest features of editres, and I strongly suggest that you play
              with it, and see what it can do.

       Save and Apply
              This button combines the Save and Apply actions described above into one button.

       Popdown Resource Box
              This button will remove the resource box from the display.

BLOCKING EDITRES REQUESTS
       The editres protocol has been built into the Athena Widget set.  This allows all applications that are linked
       against Xaw to be able to speak to the resource editor.  While this provides great flexibility, and is a use‐
       ful tool, it can quite easily be abused.  It is therefore possible for any Xaw application to specify a value
       for the editresBlock resource described below, to keep editres from divulging information  about  its  inter‐
       nals, or to disable the SetValues part of the protocol.

       editresBlock (Class EditresBlock)
               Specifies which type of blocking this application wishes to impose on the editres protocol.

       The accepted values are:

       all            Block all requests.

       setValues      Block  all SetValues requests.  As this is the only editres request that actually modifies the
                      application, this is in effect stating that the application is read-only.

       none           Allow all editres requests.

       Remember that these resources are set on any Xaw application, not editres.  They  allow  individual  applica‐
       tions  to keep all or some of the requests editres makes from ever succeeding.  Of course, editres is also an
       Xaw application, so it may also be viewed and modified by editres (rather recursive, I know), these  commands
       can be blocked by setting the editresBlock resource on editres itself.

RESOURCES
       For editres the available application resources are:

       numFlashes (Class NumFlashes)
               Specifies  the  number  of  times the widgets in the application will be flashed when the Show Active
               Widgets command in invoked.

       flashTime (Class FlashTime)
               Amount of time between the flashes described above.

       flashColor (Class flashColor)
               Specifies the color used to flash application widgets.  A bright color should be used that will imme‐
               diately draw your attention to the area being flashed, such as red or yellow.

       saveResourcesFile (Class SaveResourcesFile)
               This  is  the file the resource line will be append to when the Save button activated in the resource
               box.

WIDGETS
       In order to specify resources, it is useful to know the hierarchy of the widgets which compose  editres.   In
       the notation below, indentation indicates hierarchical structure.  The widget class name is given first, fol‐
       lowed by the widget instance name.

RESTRICTIONS
       This is a prototype, there are lots of nifty features I would love to add, but I hope this will give you some
       ideas about what a resource editor can do.
