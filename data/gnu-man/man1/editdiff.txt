NAME
       rediff, editdiff - fix offsets and counts of a hand-edited diff

SYNOPSIS
       rediff ORIGINAL EDITED

       rediff EDITED

       rediff {[--help] | [--version]}

       editdiff FILE

       editdiff {[--help] | [--version]}

DESCRIPTION
       You can use rediff to correct a hand-edited unified diff. Take a copy of the diff you want to edit, and edit
       it without changing any offsets or counts (the lines that begin “@@”). Then run rediff, telling it the name
       of the original diff file and the name of the one you have edited, and it will output the edited diff file
       but with corrected offsets and counts.

       A small script, editdiff, is provided for editing a diff file in-place.

       The types of changes that are currently handled are:

       ·   Modifying the text of any file content line (of course).

       ·   Adding new line insertions or deletions.

       ·   Adding, changing or removing context lines. Lines at the context horizon are dealt with by adjusting the
           offset and/or count.

       ·   Adding a single hunk (@@-prefixed section).

       ·   Removing multiple hunk (@@-prefixed sections).

       Alternatively, if only one argument is provided, it is taken to be the edited file and the counts and offsets
       are adjusted as appropriate. Some assumptions are made when used in this mode. See recountdiff(1) for more
       information.

OPTIONS
       --help
           Display a short usage message.

       --version
