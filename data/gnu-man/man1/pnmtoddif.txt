pnmtoddif(1)                                   General Commands Manual                                  pnmtoddif(1)



Name
       pnmtoddif - Convert a portable anymap to DDIF format

Syntax
       pnmtoddif pnmtoddif [-resolution x y] [pnmfile [ddiffile]]

OPTIONS
       resolution x y The  horizontal  and  vertical resolution of the output image in dots per inch. Defaults to 78
                      dpi.

       pnmfile        The filename for the image file in pnm format.  If this argument is  omitted,  input  is  read
                      from stdin.

       ddiffile       The  filename  for  the image file to be created in DDIF format.  If this argument is omitted,
                      the ddiffile is written to standard output. It can only specified if a pnmfile is also  speci‐
                      fied.

DESCRIPTION
       pnmtoddif takes a portable anymap from standard input and converts it into a DDIF image file on standard out‐
       put or the specified DDIF file.

       pbm format (bitmap) data is written as 1 bit DDIF, pgm format data (greyscale) as 8 bit greyscale  DDIF,  and
       ppm  format  data  is  written as 8,8,8 bit color DDIF. All DDIF image files are written as uncompressed. The
       data plane organization is interleaved by pixel.

       In addition to the number of pixels in the width and height dimension, DDIF  images  also  carry  information
       about  the size that the image should have, that is, the physical space that a pixel occupies. PBMPLUS images
       do not carry this information, hence it has to be externally supplied.  The default of 78 dpi has the benefi‐
       cial property of not causing a resize on most Digital Equipment Corporation color monitors.
