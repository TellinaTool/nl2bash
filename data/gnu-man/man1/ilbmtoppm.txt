NAME
       ilbmtoppm - convert an ILBM file into a portable pixmap

SYNOPSIS
       ilbmtoppm [-verbose] [-ignore<chunkID>] [-isham|-isehb] [-adjustcolors] [ILBMfile]

DESCRIPTION
       Reads an IFF ILBM file as input.  Produces a portable pixmap as output.  Supported ILBM types are:

       Normal ILBMs with 1-16 planes.

       Amiga Extra_Halfbrite (EHB)

       Amiga HAM with 3-16 planes.

       24 bit.

       Multiplatte (normal or HAM) pictures.

       Color map (BMHD + CMAP chunk only, nPlanes = 0).

       Unofficial direct color.
              1-16 planes for each color component.

       Chunks used:
              BMHD,  CMAP,  CAMG  (only  HAM  & EHB flags used), PCHG, BODY unofficial DCOL chunk to identify direct
              color ILBM

       Chunks ignored:
              GRAB, DEST, SPRT, CRNG, CCRT, CLUT, DPPV, DRNG, EPSF

       Other chunks (ignored but displayed in verbose mode):
              NAME, AUTH, (c), ANNO, DPI

       Unknown chunks are skipped.

OPTIONS
       -verbose
              Give some information about the ILBM file.

       -ignore <chunkID>
              Skip a chunk.  <chunkID> is the 4-letter IFF chunk identifier of the chunk to be skipped.

       -isham | -isehb
              Treat the input file as a HAM or Extra_Halfbrite picture, even if these flags or not set in  the  CAMG
              chunk (or if there is no CAMG chunk).

       -adjustcolors
              If all colors in the CMAP have a value of less then 16, ilbmtoppm assumes a 4-bit colormap and gives a
              warning.  With this option the colormap is scaled to 8 bits.

BUGS
       The multipalette PCHG BigLineChanges and Huffman decompression code is untested.
