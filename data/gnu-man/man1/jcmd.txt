NAME
       jcmd - Sends diagnostic command requests to a running Java Virtual Machine (JVM).

SYNOPSIS
           jcmd [-l|-h|-help]

           jcmd pid|main-class PerfCounter.print

           jcmd pid|main-class -f filename

           jcmd pid|main-class command[ arguments]

DESCRIPTION
       The jcmd utility is used to send diagnostic command requests to the JVM. It must be used on the same machine
       on which the JVM is running, and have the same effective user and group identifiers that were used to launch
       the JVM.

       If you run jcmd without arguments or with the -l option, it prints the list of running Java process
       identifiers with the main class and command-line arguments that were used to launch the process. Running jcmd
       with the -h or -help option prints the tool’s help message.

       If you specify the processes identifier (pid) or the main class (main-class) as the first argument, jcmd
       sends the diagnostic command request to the Java process with the specified identifier or to all Java
       processes with the specified name of the main class. You can also send the diagnostic command request to all
       available Java processes by specifying 0 as the process identifier. Use one of the following as the
       diagnostic command request:

       Perfcounter.print
           Prints the performance counters available for the specified Java process. The list of performance
           counters might vary with the Java process.

       -f filename
           The name of the file from which to read diagnostic commands and send them to the specified Java process.
           Used only with the -f option. Each command in the file must be written on a single line. Lines starting
           with a number sign (#) are ignored. Processing of the file ends when all lines have been read or when a
           line containing the stop keyword is read.

       command [arguments]
           The command to be sent to the specified Java process. The list of available diagnostic commands for a
           given process can be obtained by sending the help command to this process. Each diagnostic command has
           its own set of arguments. To see the description, syntax, and a list of available arguments for a
           command, use the name of the command as the argument for the help command.

           Note: If any arguments contain spaces, you must surround them with single or double quotation marks (' or
           "). In addition, you must escape single or double quotation marks with a backslash (\) to prevent the
           operating system shell from processing quotation marks. Alternatively, you can surround these arguments
           with single quotation marks and then with double quotation marks (or with double quotation marks and then
           with single quotation marks).

OPTIONS
       Options are mutually exclusive.

       -f filename
           Reads commands from the specified file. This option can be used only if you specify the process
           identifier or the main class as the first argument. Each command in the file must be written on a single
           line. Lines starting with a number sign (#) are ignored. Processing of the file ends when all lines have
           been read or when a line containing the stop keyword is read.

       -h
       -help
           Prints a help message.

       -l
           Prints the list of running Java processes identifiers with the main class and command-line arguments.
