DH_NUMPY(1)                                    General Commands Manual                                   DH_NUMPY(1)



NAME
       dh_numpy - adds Numpy depends to python:Depends substvar

SYNOPSYS
       dh_numpy [debhelper options]

DESCRIPTION
       dh_numpy adds information about the correct versioned depends on python-numpy to python:Depends substvar.

       This  is  needed  because  some Python extensions require strict versioned depends on python-numpy, and using
       this helper script is the easiest and most consistent way to get them.

       The helper script uses the information stored in /usr/share/numpy/versions, and the architecture type of  the
       package,  to  generate the Depends information; for a detailed description of how the dependencies are gener‐
       ate, please refer to /usr/share/doc/python-numpy/README.DebianMaints .

SEE ALSO
       debhelper(7)

       This program is not a part of debhelper (and it's provided by python-numpy).
