pnmsplit(1)                                    General Commands Manual                                   pnmsplit(1)



NAME
       pnmsplit - split a multi-image portable anymap into multiple single-image files

SYNOPSIS
       pnmsplit [pnmfile[ output_file_pattern]]


DESCRIPTION
       Reads a Netpbm file as input.  Copies each image in the input into a separate file, in the same format.

       pnmfile  is  the file specification of the input file, or - to indicate Standard Input.  The default is Stan‐
       dard Input.

       output_file_pattern tells how to name the output files.  It is the file specification  of  the  output  file,
       except that the first occurence of "%d" in it is replaced by the image sequence number in unpadded ASCII dec‐
       imal, with the sequence starting at 0.  If there is no "%d" in the pattern, pnmsplit fails.

       The default output file pattern is "image%d".

       Note that to do the reverse operation (combining multiple single-image PNM files  into  a  multi-image  one),
       there is no special Netpbm program.  Just use cat.
