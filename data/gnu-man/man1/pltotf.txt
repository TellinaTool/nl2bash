PLTOTF(1)                                      General Commands Manual                                     PLTOTF(1)



NAME
       pltotf - convert property list files to TeX font metric (tfm) format

SYNOPSIS
       pltotf [-verbose] pl_file_name[.pl] [tfm_file_name[.tfm]]

DESCRIPTION
       This  manual  page  is not meant to be exhaustive.  The complete documentation for this version of TeX can be
       found in the info file or manual Web2C: A TeX implementation.

       The pltotf program translates a (human-oriented) property list file to a (program-oriented) TeX  font  metric
       file.  Thus,  after  editing  the  property list file, a TFM file can be generated for use with, for example,
       tex(1).

       The pl_file_name is extended with .pl if it lacks a suffix. No path searching is done.

       If no tfm_file_name is given, the basename of pl_file_name with suffix .tfm is used; otherwise  tfm_file_name
       is extended with .tfm if it lacks a suffix.

OPTIONS
       Without  the -verbose option, pltotf operates silently.  With it, a banner and progress report are printed on
       stdout.
