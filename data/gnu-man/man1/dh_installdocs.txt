NAME
       dh_installdocs - install documentation into package build directories

SYNOPSIS
       dh_installdocs [debhelper options] [-A] [-Xitem] [file ...]

DESCRIPTION
       dh_installdocs is a debhelper program that is responsible for installing documentation into
       usr/share/doc/package in package build directories.

FILES
       debian/package.docs
           List documentation files to be installed into package.

       debian/copyright
           The copyright file is installed into all packages, unless a more specific copyright file is available.

       debian/package.copyright
       debian/package.README.Debian
       debian/package.TODO
           Each of these files is automatically installed if present for a package.

       debian/README.Debian
       debian/TODO
           These files are installed into the first binary package listed in debian/control.

           Note that README.debian files are also installed as README.Debian, and TODO files will be installed as
           TODO.Debian in non-native packages.

       debian/package.doc-base
           Installed as doc-base control files. Note that the doc-id will be determined from the Document: entry in
           the doc-base control file in question. In the event that multiple doc-base files in a single source
           package share the same doc-id, they will be installed to usr/share/doc-base/package instead of
           usr/share/doc-base/doc-id.

       debian/package.doc-base.*
           If your package needs to register more than one document, you need multiple doc-base files, and can name
           them like this. In the event that multiple doc-base files of this style in a single source package share
           the same doc-id, they will be installed to usr/share/doc-base/package-* instead of
           usr/share/doc-base/doc-id.

OPTIONS
       -A, --all
           Install all files specified by command line parameters in ALL packages acted on.

       -Xitem, --exclude=item
           Exclude files that contain item anywhere in their filename from being installed. Note that this includes
           doc-base files.

       --link-doc=package
           Make the documentation directory of all packages acted on be a symlink to the documentation directory of
           package. This has no effect when acting on package itself, or if the documentation directory to be
           created already exists when dh_installdocs is run. To comply with policy, package must be a binary
           package that comes from the same source package.

           debhelper will try to avoid installing files into linked documentation directories that would cause
           conflicts with the linked package. The -A option will have no effect on packages with linked
           documentation directories, and copyright, changelog, README.Debian, and TODO files will not be installed.

           (An older method to accomplish the same thing, which is still supported, is to make the documentation
           directory of a package be a dangling symlink, before calling dh_installdocs.)

       file ...
           Install these files as documentation into the first package acted on. (Or in all packages if -A is
           specified).

EXAMPLES
       This is an example of a debian/package.docs file:

         README
         TODO
         debian/notes-for-maintainers.txt
         docs/manual.txt
         docs/manual.pdf
         docs/manual-html/

NOTES
       Note that dh_installdocs will happily copy entire directory hierarchies if you ask it to (similar to cp -a).
       If it is asked to install a directory, it will install the complete contents of the directory.

       Note that this command is not idempotent. dh_prep(1) should be called between invocations of this command.
       Otherwise, it may cause multiple instances of the same text to be added to maintainer scripts.
