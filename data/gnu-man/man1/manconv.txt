NAME
       manconv - convert manual page from one encoding to another

SYNOPSIS
       manconv -f from-code[:from-code...]  -t to-code [-dqhV] [filename]

DESCRIPTION
       manconv  converts  a manual page from one encoding to another, like iconv.  Unlike iconv, it can try multiple
       possible input encodings in sequence.  This is useful for manual pages installed in  directories  without  an
       explicit encoding declaration, since they may be in UTF-8 or in a legacy character set.

       If  an  encoding  declaration  is  found on the first line of the manual page, that declaration overrides any
       input encodings specified on manconv's command line.  Encoding declarations have the following form:

              '\" -*- coding: UTF-8 -*-

       or (if manual page preprocessors are also to be declared):

              '\" t -*- coding: ISO-8859-1 -*-

OPTIONS
       -f encodings, --from-code encodings
              Try each of encodings (a colon-separated list) in sequence as the input encoding.

       -t encoding, --to-code encoding
              Convert the manual page to encoding.

       -q, --quiet
              Do not issue error messages when the page cannot be converted.

       -d, --debug
              Print debugging information.

       -h, --help
              Print a help message and exit.

       -V, --version
              Display version information.
