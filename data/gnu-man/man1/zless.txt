ZLESS(1)                                       General Commands Manual                                      ZLESS(1)



NAME
       zless - file perusal filter for crt viewing of compressed text

SYNOPSIS
       zless [ name ...  ]

DESCRIPTION
       Zless  is  a  filter  which allows examination of compressed or plain text files one screenful at a time on a
       soft-copy terminal.  It is the equivalent of setting the environment variable LESSOPEN  to  '|gzip  -cdfq  --
       %s',  and the environment variable LESSMETACHARS to '<space><tab><newline>;*?"()<>[|&^`#\$%=~', and then run‐
       ning less.  However, enough people seem to think that having the command zless available is important  to  be
       worth providing it.

SEE ALSO
       zmore(1), less(1)

BUGS
       Zless does not work with compressed data that is piped to it via standard input; it requires that input files
       be specified as arguments.  To read compressed data from a pipe,  you  can  use  ...|gunzip|less  instead  of
       ...|zless.
