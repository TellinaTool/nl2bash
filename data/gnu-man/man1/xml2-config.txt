GNOME-XML(1)                                            1.1.0                                           GNOME-XML(1)



NAME
       xml-config - script to get information about the installed version of GNOME-XML

SYNOPSIS
       xml-config [--prefix[=DIR]] [--libs] [--cflags] [--version] [--help]

DESCRIPTION
       xml-config  is  a  tool that is used to determine the compile and linker flags that should be used to compile
       and link programs that use GNOME-XML.  It is highly recommended to use pkg-config instead because building in
       a multi-arch environment is not well supported in this script.

OPTIONS
       xml-config accepts the following options:

       --version
               Print  the  currently installed version of GNOME-XML on the standard output.  Add the --static option
               to print the linker flags that are necessary to statically link a GNOME-XML program.

       --libs  Print the linker flags that are necessary to link a GNOME-XML program.

       --cflags
               Print the compiler flags that are necessary to compile a GNOME-XML program.

       --prefix=PREFIX
               If specified, use PREFIX instead of the installation prefix that GNOME-XML was built with  when  com‐
               puting  the  output  for  the  --cflags  and --libs options. This option must be specified before any
               --libs or --cflags options.
