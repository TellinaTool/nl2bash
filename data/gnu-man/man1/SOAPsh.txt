NAME
       SOAPsh - Interactive shell for SOAP calls

SYNOPSIS
         perl SOAPsh http://services.soaplite.com/examples.cgi http://www.soaplite.com/My/Examples
         > getStateName(2)
         > getStateNames(1,2,3,7)
         > getStateList([1,9])
         > getStateStruct({a=>1, b=>24})
         > Ctrl-D (Ctrl-Z on Windows)

       or

         # all parameters after uri will be executed as methods
         perl SOAPsh http://soap.4s4c.com/ssss4c/soap.asp http://simon.fell.com/calc doubler([10,20,30])
         > Ctrl-D (Ctrl-Z on Windows)

DESCRIPTION
       SOAPsh is a shell for making SOAP calls. It takes two parameters: mandatory endpoint and optional uri
       (actually it will tell you about it if you try to run it). Additional commands can follow.

       After that you'll be able to run any methods of SOAP::Lite, like autotype, readable, encoding, etc. You can
       run it the same way as you do it in your Perl script. You'll see output from method, result of SOAP call,
       detailed info on SOAP faulure or transport error.

       For full list of available methods see documentation for SOAP::Lite.

       Along with methods of SOAP::Lite you'll be able (and that's much more interesting) run any SOAP methods you
       know about on remote server and see processed results. You can even switch on debugging (with call something
       like: "on_debug(sub{print@_})") and see SOAP code with headers sent and received.
