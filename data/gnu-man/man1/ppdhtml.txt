NAME
       ppdhtml - cups html summary generator

SYNOPSIS
       ppdhtml [ -D name[=value] ] [ -I include-directory ] source-file

DESCRIPTION
       ppdhtml  reads  a driver information file and produces a HTML summary page that lists all of the drivers in a
       file and the supported options.

       The -D option sets the named variable for use in the source file. It  is  equivalent  to  using  the  #define
       directive in the source file.

       The -I option specifies an alternate include directory; multiple -I options can be supplied to add additional
       directories.
