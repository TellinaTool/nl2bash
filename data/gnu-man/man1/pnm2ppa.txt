NAME
       pnm2ppa - convert portable anymap (PNM) images to HP's PPA printer format.

SYNOPSIS
       pnm2ppa [options] [ -i infile ] [ -o outfile ]


DESCRIPTION
       Reads  portable  anymap  (PNM)  format  as  input. Binary PNM formats pnmraw = {ppmraw (color pixmap), pgmraw
       (graymap), and pbmraw (black-and-white bitmap)} are strongly preferred.  Output stream can  be  locally  pro‐
       cessed  by  Hewlett-Packard's  Printing Performance Architecture (PPA) printers (HP DeskJet 710C, 712C, 720C,
       722C, 820C, and 1000C series).

       (PNM format output can be produced from PostScript(tm) input by  the  GhostScript  output  devices  "pbmraw",
       "pgmraw"  or  "ppmraw",  or by "pnmraw", which will choose one of these  formats as appropriate for the docu‐
       ment.)  pnm2ppa assumes the input resolution is 600dpi (or 300dpi if  the  command-line  option  --dpi300  is
       used):  input at higher/lower resolutions will result in a correspondingly larger/smaller printed image, pro‐
       vided it is within the printer's allowed size range.

OPTIONS
       -b bottommargin
              Sets the bottom margin bottommargin in units of 1/600 inches (e.g.,  -b 150 corresponds to 0.25").


       -B blackness
              Sets the black ink density blackness in drops per pixel (0,1,2,3,4).


       --bi   Force bidirectional print sweeps.


       --bw   Disables the color cartridge; will print in grey scale using only the black cartridge.


       -d     Displays the current configuration.


       --dpi300
              Treat input resolution as 300dpi instead of 600dpi.


       --eco  Econofast mode: lower print quality that is faster and saves ink.


       -f configFile
              Re-reads configuration from configFile (after initially reading it from /etc/pnm2ppa.conf).


       -F GammaFile
              Overrides reading the color-correction table (Gamma curve) from the default  file  /etc/pnm2ppa.gamma,
              and uses GammaFile instead.


       --fd   Enable  fast  ordered dithering instead of using the slower, but beautiful, Floyd-Steinberg dithering.
              (Has no effect in --bw mode.)


       -g     Prints a page of color intensity samples  (for  comparison  with  gamma.ppm  data  produced  by  cali‐
              brate_ppa).  This is part of a color-correction procedure; see COLOR.txt for more details.


       -h, --help
              Displays program usage.


       -i infile
              Input file infile is either a path to a PPM file, or '-' to indicate stdin  (defaults to stdin).


       -l leftmargin
              Sets the left margin leftmargin in units of 1/600 inches (e.g., -l 150 corresponds to 0.25").


       --noGamma
              Switches off any color-correction.


       -o outfile | -
              Output  file outfile is either a path to a file or device, or '-' to indicate stdout (defaults to std‐
              out).


       -p     Disables the black ink cartridge; i.e.,  print  using only the color ink cartridge, even for  printing
              "black".  This might be useful for printing high-quality color  images.


       -r rightmargin
              Sets the right margin rightmargin in units of 1/600 inches (e.g., -r 150 corresponds to 0.25").


       -s papersize
              Sets the default paper size (now used only for color-correction output produced by the -g option).  In
              normal use, pnm2ppa now instead reads the paper dimensions from pnm input  file  headers,  and  checks
              that  it is a valid papersize for the given printer model.  Possible values for papersize are a4 (A4),
              letter or us (US Letter, 8.5"x11"), legal (US Legal, 8.5"x14").  The default is US Letter.


       -t topmargin
              Sets the top margin topmargin in units of 1/600 inches (ie -t 150 corresponds to 0.25").


       --uni  Force unidirectional (left to right) print sweeps.  Useful if "shearing" is a problem for high quality
              color images.


       -v printertype
              Selects the printer model.  Possible values of printertype are: 710, 712, 720, 722, 820 and 1000.  The
              default is the HP DeskJet 7X0 Series (710, 712, 720, 722).


       --verbose
              Displays the program's System Log messages on the standard output, as well.


       --version
              Displays the program's version information.


       -x xoffset
              Sets the x-offset xoffset from the left of the page. Units are 1/600 inches.


       -y yoffset
              Sets the y-offset yoffset from the top of the page. Units are 1/600 inches.



NOTES
       The default configuration file /etc/pnm2ppa.conf  is read in first. Command line arguments  then  modify  the
       resulting definitions.

       The  -v option resets all definitions (margins, offsets, etc.)  back to the inbuilt defaults for that printer
       and should be used before subsequent -b, -l, -r, -t, -x and -y arguments.

HISTORY
       This program was originally pbm2ppa, written by Tim Norman. It originally supported black and white output on
       the  820  series.  Tim added nascent color support in early 1999. In May 1999, Giorgio Marzano started making
       real headway in getting color support working properly. Andrew van der Stock has maintained  the  code  since
       September 1999, and  made it available at http://sourceforge.net/projects/pnm2ppa.

BUGS
       Faint  horizontal  lines  marking boundaries between print sweeps may be visible.  You may get better results
       when printing images, with the options:
         -p --uni  (this may no longer apply since recent code improvements).
