NAME
       pdfjam-slides6up - put presentation slides onto 6-up pages

SYNOPSIS
       pdfjam-slides6up [--pagenumbering SWITCH] [OPTION [OPTION] ...] [SRC [PAGESPEC] [SRC [PAGESPEC]] ...]

DESCRIPTION
       pdfjam-slides6up  converts  PDF  files  whose pages are presentation slides (with 4:3 aspect ratio) into 6-up
       versions suitable for making a handout (for example).  By default, the 6-up pages do not themselves have page
       numbers.

       To  put page numbers on the output pages, use either '--pagenumbering true' or, for example, '--pagenumbering
       3.0cm' to place the page numbers a bit lower on the page than the default position.  The  value  of  'SWITCH'
       must  be  either  'true', 'false' or a dimension that can be used by LateX. (To be precise, it's the value of
       the 'footskip' dimension in LaTeX; by default, pdfjam-slides6up sets that as 2.7cm, which works  pretty  well
       in conjunction with both '--paper a4paper' and '--paper letterpaper'.)

       If no source PDF file ('SRC') is specified, input is from /dev/stdin. If 'PAGESPEC' is omitted, all pages are
       processed.

       Source files are processed sequentially into a single output unless the '--batch' option is  used,  in  which
       case they are processed separately.

       pdfjam-slides6up  is  a  simple wrapper for pdfjam, which provides a front end to many of the capabilities of
       the pdfpages package for pdflatex.  A working  installation  of  pdflatex,  with  the  pdfpages  package,  is
       required.

       pdfjam-slides6up  operates on one or more PDF files, and (either with the '--batch' option or with '--outfile
       DIR' where 'DIR' is a directory) the resulting files have  the  suffix  '-6up'  applied  to  their  names  by
       default.  To change the suffix, use the '--suffix' option, for example

              pdfjam-slides6up --suffix '2x3' --batch myslides1.pdf myslides2.pdf

       will result in files named 'myslides1-2x3.pdf' and 'myslides2-2x3.pdf'.

       By  default  a  narrow line frame is printed around every slide.  This can be turned off if required by using
       the option '--frame false'.
