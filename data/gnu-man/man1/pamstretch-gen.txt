pamstretch-gen(1)                              General Commands Manual                             pamstretch-gen(1)



NAME
       pamstretch-gen - use pamstretch and pnmscale to scale by non-integer values


SYNOPSIS
       pamstretch-gen N [pnmfile]


DESCRIPTION
       pamstretch-gen  is a program which uses pamstretch(1), pnmfile(1), and pnmscale(1) to smoothly scale up a PNM
       file by any ratio; it's like a more general version of pamstretch (hence the name). But other than  the  `any
       ratio' bit, it's much the same as pamstretch. :-)


BUGS
       Uses awk just to make some simple floating-point calculations, which is probably overkill. But using dc makes
       my head hurt.


SEE ALSO
       pamstretch(1), pnmscale(1)
