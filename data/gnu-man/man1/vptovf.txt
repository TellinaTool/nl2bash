VPTOVF(1)                                      General Commands Manual                                     VPTOVF(1)



NAME
       vptovf - convert virtual property lists to virtual font metrics

SYNOPSIS
       vptovf [-verbose] vpl_name[.vpl] [vfm_name[.vf] [tfm_name[.tfm]]]

DESCRIPTION
       This  manual  page  is not meant to be exhaustive.  The complete documentation for this version of TeX can be
       found in the info file or manual Web2C: A TeX implementation.

       The vptovf program translates a (human-oriented) property list file to a pair of (program-oriented) files  in
       the  VF  (virtual  font)  and  TFM (TeX font metric) formats. Thus, a virtual font file can be edited and its
       exact contents can be displayed mnemonically.  New virtual fonts, which map characters as seen by TeX into an
       arbitrary sequence of low-level typesetting operations, can also be created in this way.

       All  three filenames, vpl_name, vf_name, and tfm_name, are extended with the appropriate suffix, if they lack
       one.

OPTIONS
       Without the -verbose option, vptovf operates silently.  With it, a banner and progress report are printed  on
       stdout.

SEE ALSO
       pltotf(1), tftopl(1), vftovp(1).

AUTHORS
       Donald  E.  Knuth  wrote  the  program,  based  in part on an idea of David Fuchs, starting with the code for
       pltotf(1).  Karl Berry adapted it for compilation with web2c.
