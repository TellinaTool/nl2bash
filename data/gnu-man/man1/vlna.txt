NAME
       vlna - adds tilde after each non-syllabic preposition

USAGE
       vlna [options] [filenames]

PREFACE
       There  exists a special Czech and Slovak typographical rule: you cannot leave the non-syllabic preposition on
       the end of one line and continue writting text on next line. For example, you cannot write down the  text  "v
       lese" (in a forest) like "v<new-line>lese". The program vlna adds the asciitilde between such preposition and
       the next word and removes the space(s) in this place.  It means, the program converts "v lese"  to  "v~lese".
       You  can  use  this  program as a preporcessor before TeXing. Moreower, you can set another sequence to store
       instead asciitilte (see the -x option).

DESCRIPTION
       The program vlna processes one or more files, searches the non-syllabic prepositions followed by space(s)  in
       these files and converts this/these space(s) to asciitilde for each such occurrence.

       In  the  processed  file,  the activity of the program can be blocked by %~- sequence and the activity can be
       restored again by the %~+ sequence. These sequences can include spaces, it means  that  %  ~-  is  a  correct
       sequence too.

       The  rule  to  recognize  a  preposition  follows: The arbitrary number of opening parentheses can be written
       before the preposition and before these (optional) parentheses must be the space, tabelator or new-line.  The
       preposition  itself  is  one-letter  word, the letters have to be from this set: {KkSsVvZzOoUuAI}. See the -v
       option if you want to change this set of letters. From version 1.2, the TeX sequence can  be  written  before
       preposition  and  before  the  brace.  Example:  "<new-line>([V  lese"  is converted to "<new-line>([V~lese".
       Another example: "\uv{V lese}" is converted to "\uv{V~lese}".

       One or more blank-spaces have to be included after preposition before next word. The blank-space means  space
       or  tabelator.   One <new-line> can be here too.  All these characters are removed and replaced by asciitilde
       (or by another string, see -x option). If  <new-line>  is  deleted,  another  <new-line>  is  created  before
       preposition  (and  before  optional parentheses) in order to the number of lines is kept unchanged.  Example:
       "... V<new-line><tabelator>lese" is converted to "...<new-line>V~lese".

       The program checks the consintence of TeX's math environments (if -m option  isn't  used).  For  example  the
       "$...$$...$" sequence (it means the display mode switch inside the text-math mode) generates a warning. Empty
       line inside display mode generates a warning too and the program processes next text  like  in  normal  (non-
       math)  mode.  The  existence  of  the  "$"  inside  display  mode are accepted because the constructions like
       $$..\hbox{..$..$}..$$ are allowed and common.

       The consistence of verbatim mode is checked on the end of the file.  If the file ends but the  verbatim  mode
       does not end the warning is printed.  This behavior can be switched off by -n or -w options.

       The  program  suppresses  the  tilde  changing  after letters like prepositions but they are not prepositions
       because the \TeX or \LaTeX sequence  precedes.  Example:  "vlastnosti  \TeX  u  jsou"  is  not  converted  to
       "vlastnosti  \TeX  u~jsou",  because this text is printed (after TeX processing) like "vlastnosti TeXu jsou".
       The letter "u" is a suffix here, no preposition.

OPTIONS
       The options are optional and can be written in arbitrarty order separated by space.

       -f     Filter. The [filenames] are treated as follows:

              vlna -f filename1 filename2
                  Input is filename1, output is filename2.

              vlna -f filename1
                  Input is filename1, output is stdout.

              vlna -f
                  Input is stdin, output is stdout.

              vlna filename1 [filename2 [filename3 ...]]
                  If the -f option is omitted then each file is processed independently and it is re-written.

       -s     The silent mode. No messages, warnings, statistics are printed.   Only  errors  which  terminates  the
              program  untimely  are printed.  If this parameter is omitted then banner, warnings and statistics are
              printed to stderr.

       -r     Do not create the backups. The option -r is irrelevant if the -f option is used.  If  the  -f  and  -r
              options  aren't  used  then each re-written file is stored with its original contents to a backup file
              (the name of backup file is the same as  filename,  only  the  tilde  is  used  instead  of  the  last
              character).

       -v characters
              The  set  of  characters  treated  as  non-syllabic  prepositions is declared by this option. Default:
              -v KkSsVvZzOoUuAI.  The space between -v and characters is required.

       -x code
              The code is a string written in hexadecimal notation (even hexa digits is required). This string  will
              be  saved  after prepositions instead asciitilde which is default.  The example: -x C2A0 two bytes are
              stored after each non-syllabic preposition, first byte has C2 code and second byte has A0  code.  This
              example  means that NO-BREAK SPACE in UTF8 encoding will be used after prepositions.  Another example:
              -x 00A0 the NO-BREAK SPACE in UTF16 encoding.  Another example: -x 48454C4C4F the string HELLO will be
              used.  The space between -x and code is required.

       -m     The  math-modes  ($...$ and $$...$$) are ignored.  It means that non-syllabic prepositions is searched
              in math-mode too.  Default (without -m option): no  changes  in  math  modes  are  done  because  (for
              example) "v" is variable in math-mode, no preposition.

       -n     The  verbatim  mode  (\verb<char>...<char>, \begtt...\endtt) is ignored, it means the program can do a
              changes in verbatim environment.  Default (without -n option): no changes in verbatim mode are done.

       -l     The    LaTeX    mode.    The    following    environments    are    treated    as    display     mode:
              \begin{display}...\end{display} and \begin{equation}...\end{equation} and the following environment is
              treated as verbatim mode: \begin{verbatim}...\end{verbatim}.

       -w     The web mode (Knuth's web, no www:-). The following sequences are treated as  verbatim:  @<,  @d...@*,
              @space  or  @>|.   It  means  program  code  is unchanged in *.w or *.web files, only web-comments are
              processed.

EXAMPLES
       vlna -m -n -s -r file
              The program has a behavior similar to the old vlnka program.

       vlna *.tex
              All files with .tex suffix in current directory will be processed (and possibly changed). (The "*"  is
              UNIX-shell feautre).

       vlna -f file > /dev/null
              Only the consistence checking of math and verbatim modes is processed.  No changes are done.
