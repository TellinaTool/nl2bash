NAME
       lpr - print files

SYNOPSIS
       lpr [ -E ] [ -H server[:port] ] [ -U username ] [ -P destination[/instance] ] [ -# num-copies [ -h ] [ -l ] [
       -m ] [ -o option[=value] ] [ -p] [ -q ] [ -r ] [ -C/J/T title ] [ file(s) ]

DESCRIPTION
       lpr submits files for printing. Files named on the command line are sent to the named printer (or the default
       destination  if no destination is specified). If no files are listed on the command-line, lpr reads the print
       file from the standard input.

THE DEFAULT DESTINATION
       CUPS provides many ways to set the default destination. The "LPDEST" and "PRINTER" environment variables  are
       consulted first. If neither are set, the current default set using the lpoptions(1) command is used, followed
       by the default set using the lpadmin(8) command.

OPTIONS
       The following options are recognized by lpr:

       -E
            Forces encryption when connecting to the server.

       -H server[:port]
            Specifies an alternate server.

       -C "name"

       -J "name"

       -T "name"
            Sets the job name.

       -P destination[/instance]
            Prints files to the named printer.

       -U username
            Specifies an alternate username.

       -# copies
            Sets the number of copies to print from 1 to 100.

       -h
            Disables banner printing. This option is equivalent to "-o job-sheets=none".

       -l
            Specifies that the print file is already formatted for the destination and should be sent  without  fil‐
            tering. This option is equivalent to "-o raw".

       -m
            Send an email on job completion.

       -o option[=value]
            Sets a job option.

       -p
            Specifies  that  the  print file should be formatted with a shaded header with the date, time, job name,
            and page number. This option is equivalent to "-o prettyprint" and is only  useful  when  printing  text
            files.

       -q
            Hold job for printing.

       -r
            Specifies that the named print files should be deleted after printing them.

COMPATIBILITY
       The  "c",  "d", "f", "g", "i", "n", "t", "v", and "w" options are not supported by CUPS and produce a warning
       message if used.
