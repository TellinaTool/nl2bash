NAME
       java - Launches a Java application.

SYNOPSIS
           java [options] classname [args]

           java [options] -jar filename [args]

       options
           Command-line options separated by spaces. See Options.

       classname
           The name of the class to be launched.

       filename
           The name of the Java Archive (JAR) file to be called. Used only with the -jar option.

       args
           The arguments passed to the main() method separated by spaces.

DESCRIPTION
       The java command starts a Java application. It does this by starting the Java Runtime Environment (JRE),
       loading the specified class, and calling that class's main() method. The method must be declared public and
       static, it must not return any value, and it must accept a String array as a parameter. The method
       declaration has the following form:

           public static void main(String[] args)


       The java command can be used to launch a JavaFX application by loading a class that either has a main()
       method or that extends javafx.application.Application. In the latter case, the launcher constructs an
       instance of the Application class, calls its init() method, and then calls the start(javafx.stage.Stage)
       method.

       By default, the first argument that is not an option of the java command is the fully qualified name of the
       class to be called. If the -jar option is specified, its argument is the name of the JAR file containing
       class and resource files for the application. The startup class must be indicated by the Main-Class manifest
       header in its source code.

       The JRE searches for the startup class (and other classes used by the application) in three sets of
       locations: the bootstrap class path, the installed extensions, and the user’s class path.

       Arguments after the class file name or the JAR file name are passed to the main() method.

OPTIONS
       The java command supports a wide range of options that can be divided into the following categories:

       ·   Standard Options

       ·   Non-Standard Options

       ·   Advanced Runtime Options

       ·   Advanced JIT Compiler Options

       ·   Advanced Serviceability Options

       ·   Advanced Garbage Collection Options

       Standard options are guaranteed to be supported by all implementations of the Java Virtual Machine (JVM).
       They are used for common actions, such as checking the version of the JRE, setting the class path, enabling
       verbose output, and so on.

       Non-standard options are general purpose options that are specific to the Java HotSpot Virtual Machine, so
       they are not guaranteed to be supported by all JVM implementations, and are subject to change. These options
       start with -X.

       Advanced options are not recommended for casual use. These are developer options used for tuning specific
       areas of the Java HotSpot Virtual Machine operation that often have specific system requirements and may
       require privileged access to system configuration parameters. They are also not guaranteed to be supported by
       all JVM implementations, and are subject to change. Advanced options start with -XX.

       To keep track of the options that were deprecated or removed in the latest release, there is a section named
       Deprecated and Removed Options at the end of the document.

       Boolean options are used to either enable a feature that is disabled by default or disable a feature that is
       enabled by default. Such options do not require a parameter. Boolean -XX options are enabled using the plus
       sign (-XX:+OptionName) and disabled using the minus sign (-XX:-OptionName).

       For options that require an argument, the argument may be separated from the option name by a space, a colon
       (:), or an equal sign (=), or the argument may directly follow the option (the exact syntax differs for each
       option). If you are expected to specify the size in bytes, you can use no suffix, or use the suffix k or K
       for kilobytes (KB), m or M for megabytes (MB), g or G for gigabytes (GB). For example, to set the size to 8
       GB, you can specify either 8g, 8192m, 8388608k, or 8589934592 as the argument. If you are expected to specify
       the percentage, use a number from 0 to 1 (for example, specify 0.25 for 25%).

   Standard Options
       These are the most commonly used options that are supported by all implementations of the JVM.

       -agentlib:libname[=options]
           Loads the specified native agent library. After the library name, a comma-separated list of options
           specific to the library can be used.

           If the option -agentlib:foo is specified, then the JVM attempts to load the library named libfoo.so in
           the location specified by the LD_LIBRARY_PATH system variable (on OS X this variable is
           DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH).

           The following example shows how to load the heap profiling tool (HPROF) library and get sample CPU
           information every 20 ms, with a stack depth of 3:

               -agentlib:hprof=cpu=samples,interval=20,depth=3

           The following example shows how to load the Java Debug Wire Protocol (JDWP) library and listen for the
           socket connection on port 8000, suspending the JVM before the main class loads:

               -agentlib:jdwp=transport=dt_socket,server=y,address=8000

           For more information about the native agent libraries, refer to the following:

               http://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/lang/instrument/package-summary.html

           ·   Agent Command Line Options in the JVM Tools Interface guide at
               http://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/platform/jvmti/jvmti.html#starting

       -agentpath:pathname[=options]
           Loads the native agent library specified by the absolute path name. This option is equivalent to
           -agentlib but uses the full path and file name of the library.

       -client
           Selects the Java HotSpot Client VM. The 64-bit version of the Java SE Development Kit (JDK) currently
           ignores this option and instead uses the Server JVM.

           For default JVM selection, see Server-Class Machine Detection at
           http://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/technotes/guides/vm/server-class.html

       -Dproperty=value
           Sets a system property value. The property variable is a string with no spaces that represents the name
           of the property. The value variable is a string that represents the value of the property. If value is a
           string with spaces, then enclose it in quotation marks (for example -Dfoo="foo bar").

       -d32
           Runs the application in a 32-bit environment. If a 32-bit environment is not installed or is not
           supported, then an error will be reported. By default, the application is run in a 32-bit environment
           unless a 64-bit system is used.

       -d64
           Runs the application in a 64-bit environment. If a 64-bit environment is not installed or is not
           supported, then an error will be reported. By default, the application is run in a 32-bit environment
           unless a 64-bit system is used.

           Currently only the Java HotSpot Server VM supports 64-bit operation, and the -server option is implicit
           with the use of -d64. The -client option is ignored with the use of -d64. This is subject to change in a
           future release.

       -disableassertions[:[packagename]...|:classname]
       -da[:[packagename]...|:classname]
           Disables assertions. By default, assertions are disabled in all packages and classes.

           With no arguments, -disableassertions (-da) disables assertions in all packages and classes. With the
           packagename argument ending in ..., the switch disables assertions in the specified package and any
           subpackages. If the argument is simply ..., then the switch disables assertions in the unnamed package in
           the current working directory. With the classname argument, the switch disables assertions in the
           specified class.

           The -disableassertions (-da) option applies to all class loaders and to system classes (which do not have
           a class loader). There is one exception to this rule: if the option is provided with no arguments, then
           it does not apply to system classes. This makes it easy to disable assertions in all classes except for
           system classes. The -disablesystemassertions option enables you to disable assertions in all system
           classes.

           To explicitly enable assertions in specific packages or classes, use the -enableassertions (-ea) option.
           Both options can be used at the same time. For example, to run the MyClass application with assertions
           enabled in package com.wombat.fruitbat (and any subpackages) but disabled in class
           com.wombat.fruitbat.Brickbat, use the following command:

               java -ea:com.wombat.fruitbat... -da:com.wombat.fruitbat.Brickbat MyClass


       -disablesystemassertions
       -dsa
           Disables assertions in all system classes.

       -enableassertions[:[packagename]...|:classname]
       -ea[:[packagename]...|:classname]
           Enables assertions. By default, assertions are disabled in all packages and classes.

           With no arguments, -enableassertions (-ea) enables assertions in all packages and classes. With the
           packagename argument ending in ..., the switch enables assertions in the specified package and any
           subpackages. If the argument is simply ..., then the switch enables assertions in the unnamed package in
           the current working directory. With the classname argument, the switch enables assertions in the
           specified class.

           The -enableassertions (-ea) option applies to all class loaders and to system classes (which do not have
           a class loader). There is one exception to this rule: if the option is provided with no arguments, then
           it does not apply to system classes. This makes it easy to enable assertions in all classes except for
           system classes. The -enablesystemassertions option provides a separate switch to enable assertions in all
           system classes.

           To explicitly disable assertions in specific packages or classes, use the -disableassertions (-da)
           option. If a single command contains multiple instances of these switches, then they are processed in
           order before loading any classes. For example, to run the MyClass application with assertions enabled
           only in package com.wombat.fruitbat (and any subpackages) but disabled in class
           com.wombat.fruitbat.Brickbat, use the following command:

               java -ea:com.wombat.fruitbat... -da:com.wombat.fruitbat.Brickbat MyClass


       -enablesystemassertions
       -esa
           Enables assertions in all system classes.

       -help
       -?
           Displays usage information for the java command without actually running the JVM.

       -jar filename
           Executes a program encapsulated in a JAR file. The filename argument is the name of a JAR file with a
           manifest that contains a line in the form Main-Class:classname that defines the class with the public
           static void main(String[] args) method that serves as your application's starting point.

           When you use the -jar option, the specified JAR file is the source of all user classes, and other class
           path settings are ignored.

               http://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/deployment/jar/index.html

       -javaagent:jarpath[=options]
           Loads the specified Java programming language agent. For more information about instrumenting Java
           applications, see the java.lang.instrument package description in the Java API documentation at
           http://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/lang/instrument/package-summary.html

       -jre-restrict-search
           Includes user-private JREs in the version search.

       -no-jre-restrict-search
           Excludes user-private JREs from the version search.

       -server
           Selects the Java HotSpot Server VM. The 64-bit version of the JDK supports only the Server VM, so in that
           case the option is implicit.

           For default JVM selection, see Server-Class Machine Detection at
           http://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/technotes/guides/vm/server-class.html

       -showversion
           Displays version information and continues execution of the application. This option is equivalent to the
           -version option except that the latter instructs the JVM to exit after displaying version information.

       -splash:imgname
           Shows the splash screen with the image specified by imgname. For example, to show the splash.gif file
           from the images directory when starting your application, use the following option:

               -splash:images/splash.gif


       -verbose:class
           Displays information about each loaded class.

       -verbose:gc
           Displays information about each garbage collection (GC) event.

       -verbose:jni
           Displays information about the use of native methods and other Java Native Interface (JNI) activity.

       -version
           Displays version information and then exits. This option is equivalent to the -showversion option except
           that the latter does not instruct the JVM to exit after displaying version information.

       -version:release
           Specifies the release version to be used for running the application. If the version of the java command
           called does not meet this specification and an appropriate implementation is found on the system, then
           the appropriate implementation will be used.

           The release argument specifies either the exact version string, or a list of version strings and ranges
           separated by spaces. A version string is the developer designation of the version number in the following
           form: 1.x.0_u (where x is the major version number, and u is the update version number). A version range
           is made up of a version string followed by a plus sign (+) to designate this version or later, or a part
           of a version string followed by an asterisk (*) to designate any version string with a matching prefix.
           Version strings and ranges can be combined using a space for a logical OR combination, or an ampersand
           (&) for a logical AND combination of two version strings/ranges. For example, if running the class or JAR
           file requires either JRE 6u13 (1.6.0_13), or any JRE 6 starting from 6u10 (1.6.0_10), specify the
           following:

               -version:"1.6.0_13 1.6* & 1.6.0_10+"

           Quotation marks are necessary only if there are spaces in the release parameter.

           For JAR files, the preference is to specify version requirements in the JAR file manifest rather than on
           the command line.

   Non-Standard Options
       These options are general purpose options that are specific to the Java HotSpot Virtual Machine.

       -X
           Displays help for all available -X options.

       -Xbatch
           Disables background compilation. By default, the JVM compiles the method as a background task, running
           the method in interpreter mode until the background compilation is finished. The -Xbatch flag disables
           background compilation so that compilation of all methods proceeds as a foreground task until completed.

           This option is equivalent to -XX:-BackgroundCompilation.

       -Xbootclasspath:path
           Specifies a list of directories, JAR files, and ZIP archives separated by colons (:) to search for boot
           class files. These are used in place of the boot class files included in the JDK.

           Do not deploy applications that use this option to override a class in rt.jar, because this violates the
           JRE binary code license.

       -Xbootclasspath/a:path
           Specifies a list of directories, JAR files, and ZIP archives separated by colons (:) to append to the end
           of the default bootstrap class path.

           Do not deploy applications that use this option to override a class in rt.jar, because this violates the
           JRE binary code license.

       -Xbootclasspath/p:path
           Specifies a list of directories, JAR files, and ZIP archives separated by colons (:) to prepend to the
           front of the default bootstrap class path.

           Do not deploy applications that use this option to override a class in rt.jar, because this violates the
           JRE binary code license.

       -Xcheck:jni
           Performs additional checks for Java Native Interface (JNI) functions. Specifically, it validates the
           parameters passed to the JNI function and the runtime environment data before processing the JNI request.
           Any invalid data encountered indicates a problem in the native code, and the JVM will terminate with an
           irrecoverable error in such cases. Expect a performance degradation when this option is used.

       -Xcomp
           Forces compilation of methods on first invocation. By default, the Client VM (-client) performs 1,000
           interpreted method invocations and the Server VM (-server) performs 10,000 interpreted method invocations
           to gather information for efficient compilation. Specifying the -Xcomp option disables interpreted method
           invocations to increase compilation performance at the expense of efficiency.

           You can also change the number of interpreted method invocations before compilation using the
           -XX:CompileThreshold option.

       -Xdebug
           Does nothing. Provided for backward compatibility.

       -Xdiag
           Shows additional diagnostic messages.

       -Xfuture
           Enables strict class-file format checks that enforce close conformance to the class-file format
           specification. Developers are encouraged to use this flag when developing new code because the stricter
           checks will become the default in future releases.

       -Xint
           Runs the application in interpreted-only mode. Compilation to native code is disabled, and all bytecode
           is executed by the interpreter. The performance benefits offered by the just in time (JIT) compiler are
           not present in this mode.

       -Xinternalversion
           Displays more detailed JVM version information than the -version option, and then exits.

       -Xloggc:filename
           Sets the file to which verbose GC events information should be redirected for logging. The information
           written to this file is similar to the output of -verbose:gc with the time elapsed since the first GC
           event preceding each logged event. The -Xloggc option overrides -verbose:gc if both are given with the
           same java command.

           Example:

               -Xloggc:garbage-collection.log


       -Xmaxjitcodesize=size
           Specifies the maximum code cache size (in bytes) for JIT-compiled code. Append the letter k or K to
           indicate kilobytes, m or M to indicate megabytes, g or G to indicate gigabytes. The default maximum code
           cache size is 240 MB; if you disable tiered compilation with the option -XX:-TieredCompilation, then the
           default size is 48 MB:

               -Xmaxjitcodesize=240m

           This option is equivalent to -XX:ReservedCodeCacheSize.

       -Xmixed
           Executes all bytecode by the interpreter except for hot methods, which are compiled to native code.

       -Xmnsize
           Sets the initial and maximum size (in bytes) of the heap for the young generation (nursery). Append the
           letter k or K to indicate kilobytes, m or M to indicate megabytes, g or G to indicate gigabytes.

           The young generation region of the heap is used for new objects. GC is performed in this region more
           often than in other regions. If the size for the young generation is too small, then a lot of minor
           garbage collections will be performed. If the size is too large, then only full garbage collections will
           be performed, which can take a long time to complete. Oracle recommends that you keep the size for the
           young generation between a half and a quarter of the overall heap size.

           The following examples show how to set the initial and maximum size of young generation to 256 MB using
           various units:

               -Xmn256m
               -Xmn262144k
               -Xmn268435456

           Instead of the -Xmn option to set both the initial and maximum size of the heap for the young generation,
           you can use -XX:NewSize to set the initial size and -XX:MaxNewSize to set the maximum size.

       -Xmssize
           Sets the initial size (in bytes) of the heap. This value must be a multiple of 1024 and greater than 1
           MB. Append the letter k or K to indicate kilobytes, m or M to indicate megabytes, g or G to indicate
           gigabytes.

           The following examples show how to set the size of allocated memory to 6 MB using various units:

               -Xms6291456
               -Xms6144k
               -Xms6m

           If you do not set this option, then the initial size will be set as the sum of the sizes allocated for
           the old generation and the young generation. The initial size of the heap for the young generation can be
           set using the -Xmn option or the -XX:NewSize option.

       -Xmxsize
           Specifies the maximum size (in bytes) of the memory allocation pool in bytes. This value must be a
           multiple of 1024 and greater than 2 MB. Append the letter k or K to indicate kilobytes, m or M to
           indicate megabytes, g or G to indicate gigabytes. The default value is chosen at runtime based on system
           configuration. For server deployments, -Xms and -Xmx are often set to the same value. See the section
           "Ergonomics" in Java SE HotSpot Virtual Machine Garbage Collection Tuning Guide at
           http://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/technotes/guides/vm/gctuning/index.html.

           The following examples show how to set the maximum allowed size of allocated memory to 80 MB using
           various units:

               -Xmx83886080
               -Xmx81920k
               -Xmx80m

           The -Xmx option is equivalent to -XX:MaxHeapSize.

       -Xnoclassgc
           Disables garbage collection (GC) of classes. This can save some GC time, which shortens interruptions
           during the application run.

           When you specify -Xnoclassgc at startup, the class objects in the application will be left untouched
           during GC and will always be considered live. This can result in more memory being permanently occupied
           which, if not used carefully, will throw an out of memory exception.

       -Xprof
           Profiles the running program and sends profiling data to standard output. This option is provided as a
           utility that is useful in program development and is not intended to be used in production systems.

       -Xrs
           Reduces the use of operating system signals by the JVM.

           Shutdown hooks enable orderly shutdown of a Java application by running user cleanup code (such as
           closing database connections) at shutdown, even if the JVM terminates abruptly.

           The JVM catches signals to implement shutdown hooks for unexpected termination. The JVM uses SIGHUP,
           SIGINT, and SIGTERM to initiate the running of shutdown hooks.

           The JVM uses a similar mechanism to implement the feature of dumping thread stacks for debugging
           purposes. The JVM uses SIGQUIT to perform thread dumps.

           Applications embedding the JVM frequently need to trap signals such as SIGINT or SIGTERM, which can lead
           to interference with the JVM signal handlers. The -Xrs option is available to address this issue. When
           -Xrs is used, the signal masks for SIGINT, SIGTERM, SIGHUP, and SIGQUIT are not changed by the JVM, and
           signal handlers for these signals are not installed.

           There are two consequences of specifying -Xrs:

           ·   SIGQUIT thread dumps are not available.

           ·   User code is responsible for causing shutdown hooks to run, for example, by calling System.exit()
               when the JVM is to be terminated.

       -Xshare:mode
           Sets the class data sharing (CDS) mode. Possible mode arguments for this option include the following:

           auto
               Use CDS if possible. This is the default value for Java HotSpot 32-Bit Client VM.

           on
               Require the use of CDS. Print an error message and exit if class data sharing cannot be used.

           off
               Do not use CDS. This is the default value for Java HotSpot 32-Bit Server VM, Java HotSpot 64-Bit
               Client VM, and Java HotSpot 64-Bit Server VM.

           dump
               Manually generate the CDS archive. Specify the application class path as described in "Setting the
               Class Path ".

               You should regenerate the CDS archive with each new JDK release.

       -XshowSettings:category
           Shows settings and continues. Possible category arguments for this option include the following:

           all
               Shows all categories of settings. This is the default value.

           locale
               Shows settings related to locale.

           properties
               Shows settings related to system properties.

           vm
               Shows the settings of the JVM.

       -Xsssize
           Sets the thread stack size (in bytes). Append the letter k or K to indicate KB, m or M to indicate MB, g
           or G to indicate GB. The default value depends on the platform:

           ·   Linux/ARM (32-bit): 320 KB

           ·   Linux/i386 (32-bit): 320 KB

           ·   Linux/x64 (64-bit): 1024 KB

           ·   OS X (64-bit): 1024 KB

           ·   Oracle Solaris/i386 (32-bit): 320 KB

           ·   Oracle Solaris/x64 (64-bit): 1024 KB

           The following examples set the thread stack size to 1024 KB in different units:

               -Xss1m
               -Xss1024k
               -Xss1048576

           This option is equivalent to -XX:ThreadStackSize.

       -Xusealtsigs
           Use alternative signals instead of SIGUSR1 and SIGUSR2 for JVM internal signals. This option is
           equivalent to -XX:+UseAltSigs.

       -Xverify:mode
           Sets the mode of the bytecode verifier. Bytecode verification helps to troubleshoot some problems, but it
           also adds overhead to the running application. Possible mode arguments for this option include the
           following:

           none
               Do not verify the bytecode. This reduces startup time and also reduces the protection provided by
               Java.

           remote
               Verify those classes that are not loaded by the bootstrap class loader. This is the default behavior
               if you do not specify the -Xverify option.

           all
               Verify all classes.

   Advanced Runtime Options
       These options control the runtime behavior of the Java HotSpot VM.

       -XX:+CheckEndorsedAndExtDirs
           Enables the option to prevent the java command from running a Java application if it uses the
           endorsed-standards override mechanism or the extension mechanism. This option checks if an application is
           using one of these mechanisms by checking the following:

           ·   The java.ext.dirs or java.endorsed.dirs system property is set.

           ·   The lib/endorsed directory exists and is not empty.

           ·   The lib/ext directory contains any JAR files other than those of the JDK.

           ·   The system-wide platform-specific extension directory contains any JAR files.

       -XX:+DisableAttachMechanism
           Enables the option that disables the mechanism that lets tools attach to the JVM. By default, this option
           is disabled, meaning that the attach mechanism is enabled and you can use tools such as jcmd, jstack,
           jmap, and jinfo.

       -XX:ErrorFile=filename
           Specifies the path and file name to which error data is written when an irrecoverable error occurs. By
           default, this file is created in the current working directory and named hs_err_pidpid.log where pid is
           the identifier of the process that caused the error. The following example shows how to set the default
           log file (note that the identifier of the process is specified as %p):

               -XX:ErrorFile=./hs_err_pid%p.log

           The following example shows how to set the error log to /var/log/java/java_error.log:

               -XX:ErrorFile=/var/log/java/java_error.log

           If the file cannot be created in the specified directory (due to insufficient space, permission problem,
           or another issue), then the file is created in the temporary directory for the operating system. The
           temporary directory is /tmp.

       -XX:+FailOverToOldVerifier
           Enables automatic failover to the old verifier when the new type checker fails. By default, this option
           is disabled and it is ignored (that is, treated as disabled) for classes with a recent bytecode version.
           You can enable it for classes with older versions of the bytecode.

       -XX:+FlightRecorder
           Enables the use of the Java Flight Recorder (JFR) during the runtime of the application. This is a
           commercial feature that works in conjunction with the -XX:+UnlockCommercialFeatures option as follows:

               java -XX:+UnlockCommercialFeatures -XX:+FlightRecorder

           If this option is not provided, Java Flight Recorder can still be enabled in a running JVM by providing
           the appropriate jcmd diagnostic commands.

       -XX:-FlightRecorder
           Disables the use of the Java Flight Recorder (JFR) during the runtime of the application. This is a
           commercial feature that works in conjunction with the -XX:+UnlockCommercialFeatures option as follows:

               java -XX:+UnlockCommercialFeatures -XX:-FlightRecorder

           If this option is provided, Java Flight Recorder cannot be enabled in a running JVM.

       -XX:FlightRecorderOptions=parameter=value
           Sets the parameters that control the behavior of JFR. This is a commercial feature that works in
           conjunction with the -XX:+UnlockCommercialFeatures option. This option can be used only when JFR is
           enabled (that is, the -XX:+FlightRecorder option is specified).

           The following list contains all available JFR parameters:

           defaultrecording={true|false}
               Specifies whether the recording is a continuous background recording or if it runs for a limited
               time. By default, this parameter is set to false (recording runs for a limited time). To make the
               recording run continuously, set the parameter to true.

           disk={true|false}
               Specifies whether JFR should write a continuous recording to disk. By default, this parameter is set
               to false (continuous recording to disk is disabled). To enable it, set the parameter to true, and
               also set defaultrecording=true.

           dumponexit={true|false}
               Specifies whether a dump file of JFR data should be generated when the JVM terminates in a controlled
               manner. By default, this parameter is set to false (dump file on exit is not generated). To enable
               it, set the parameter to true, and also set defaultrecording=true.

               The dump file is written to the location defined by the dumponexitpath parameter.

           dumponexitpath=path
               Specifies the path and name of the dump file with JFR data that is created when the JVM exits in a
               controlled manner if you set the dumponexit=true parameter. Setting the path makes sense only if you
               also set defaultrecording=true.

               If the specified path is a directory, the JVM assigns a file name that shows the creation date and
               time. If the specified path includes a file name and if that file already exists, the JVM creates a
               new file by appending the date and time stamp to the specified file name.

           globalbuffersize=size
               Specifies the total amount of primary memory (in bytes) used for data retention. Append k or K, to
               specify the size in KB, m or M to specify the size in MB, g or G to specify the size in GB. By
               default, the size is set to 462848 bytes.

           loglevel={quiet|error|warning|info|debug|trace}
               Specify the amount of data written to the log file by JFR. By default, it is set to info.

           maxage=time
               Specifies the maximum age of disk data to keep for the default recording. Append s to specify the
               time in seconds, m for minutes, h for hours, or d for days (for example, specifying 30s means 30
               seconds). By default, the maximum age is set to 15 minutes (15m).

               This parameter is valid only if you set the disk=true parameter.

           maxchunksize=size
               Specifies the maximum size (in bytes) of the data chunks in a recording. Append k or K, to specify
               the size in KB, m or M to specify the size in MB, g or G to specify the size in GB. By default, the
               maximum size of data chunks is set to 12 MB.

           maxsize=size
               Specifies the maximum size (in bytes) of disk data to keep for the default recording. Append k or K,
               to specify the size in KB, m or M to specify the size in MB, g or G to specify the size in GB. By
               default, the maximum size of disk data is not limited, and this parameter is set to 0.

               This parameter is valid only if you set the disk=true parameter.

           repository=path
               Specifies the repository (a directory) for temporary disk storage. By default, the system’s temporary
               directory is used.

           samplethreads={true|false}
               Specifies whether thread sampling is enabled. Thread sampling occurs only if the sampling event is
               enabled along with this parameter. By default, this parameter is enabled.

           settings=path
               Specifies the path and name of the event settings file (of type JFC). By default, the default.jfc
               file is used, which is located in JAVA_HOME/jre/lib/jfr.

           stackdepth=depth
               Stack depth for stack traces by JFR. By default, the depth is set to 64 method calls. The maximum is
               2048, minimum is 1.

           threadbuffersize=size
               Specifies the per-thread local buffer size (in bytes). Append k or K, to specify the size in KB, m or
               M to specify the size in MB, g or G to specify the size in GB. Higher values for this parameter allow
               more data gathering without contention to flush it to the global storage. It can increase application
               footprint in a thread-rich environment. By default, the local buffer size is set to 5 KB.

           You can specify values for multiple parameters by separating them with a comma. For example, to instruct
           JFR to write a continuous recording to disk, and set the maximum size of data chunks to 10 MB, specify
           the following:

               -XX:FlightRecorderOptions=defaultrecording=true,disk=true,maxchunksize=10M


       -XX:LargePageSizeInBytes=size
           On Solaris, sets the maximum size (in bytes) for large pages used for Java heap. The size argument must
           be a power of 2 (2, 4, 8, 16, ...). Append the letter k or K to indicate kilobytes, m or M to indicate
           megabytes, g or G to indicate gigabytes. By default, the size is set to 0, meaning that the JVM chooses
           the size for large pages automatically.

           The following example illustrates how to set the large page size to 4 megabytes (MB):

               -XX:LargePageSizeInBytes=4m


       -XX:MaxDirectMemorySize=size
           Sets the maximum total size (in bytes) of the New I/O (the java.nio package) direct-buffer allocations.
           Append the letter k or K to indicate kilobytes, m or M to indicate megabytes, g or G to indicate
           gigabytes. By default, the size is set to 0, meaning that the JVM chooses the size for NIO direct-buffer
           allocations automatically.

           The following examples illustrate how to set the NIO size to 1024 KB in different units:

               -XX:MaxDirectMemorySize=1m
               -XX:MaxDirectMemorySize=1024k
               -XX:MaxDirectMemorySize=1048576


       -XX:NativeMemoryTracking=mode
           Specifies the mode for tracking JVM native memory usage. Possible mode arguments for this option include
           the following:

           off
               Do not track JVM native memory usage. This is the default behavior if you do not specify the
               -XX:NativeMemoryTracking option.

           summary
               Only track memory usage by JVM subsystems, such as Java heap, class, code, and thread.

           detail
               In addition to tracking memory usage by JVM subsystems, track memory usage by individual CallSite,
               individual virtual memory region and its committed regions.

       -XX:ObjectAlignmentInBytes=alignment
           Sets the memory alignment of Java objects (in bytes). By default, the value is set to 8 bytes. The
           specified value should be a power of two, and must be within the range of 8 and 256 (inclusive). This
           option makes it possible to use compressed pointers with large Java heap sizes.

           The heap size limit in bytes is calculated as:

           4GB * ObjectAlignmentInBytes

           Note: As the alignment value increases, the unused space between objects will also increase. As a result,
           you may not realize any benefits from using compressed pointers with large Java heap sizes.

       -XX:OnError=string
           Sets a custom command or a series of semicolon-separated commands to run when an irrecoverable error
           occurs. If the string contains spaces, then it must be enclosed in quotation marks.

           The following example shows how the -XX:OnError option can be used to run the gcore command to create the
           core image, and the debugger is started to attach to the process in case of an irrecoverable error (the
           %p designates the current process):

               -XX:OnError="gcore %p;dbx - %p"


       -XX:OnOutOfMemoryError=string
           Sets a custom command or a series of semicolon-separated commands to run when an OutOfMemoryError
           exception is first thrown. If the string contains spaces, then it must be enclosed in quotation marks.
           For an example of a command string, see the description of the -XX:OnError option.

       -XX:+PerfDataSaveToFile
           If enabled, saves jstat(1) binary data when the Java application exits. This binary data is saved in a
           file named hsperfdata_<pid>, where <pid> is the process identifier of the Java application you ran. Use
           jstat to display the performance data contained in this file as follows:

               jstat -class file:///<path>/hsperfdata_<pid>
               jstat -gc file:///<path>/hsperfdata_<pid>

       -XX:+PrintCommandLineFlags
           Enables printing of ergonomically selected JVM flags that appeared on the command line. It can be useful
           to know the ergonomic values set by the JVM, such as the heap space size and the selected garbage
           collector. By default, this option is disabled and flags are not printed.

       -XX:+PrintNMTStatistics
           Enables printing of collected native memory tracking data at JVM exit when native memory tracking is
           enabled (see -XX:NativeMemoryTracking). By default, this option is disabled and native memory tracking
           data is not printed.

       -XX:+RelaxAccessControlCheck
           Decreases the amount of access control checks in the verifier. By default, this option is disabled, and
           it is ignored (that is, treated as disabled) for classes with a recent bytecode version. You can enable
           it for classes with older versions of the bytecode.

       -XX:+ResourceManagement
           Enables the use of Resource Management during the runtime of the application.

           This is a commercial feature that requires you to also specify the -XX:+UnlockCommercialFeatures option
           as follows:

           java -XX:+UnlockCommercialFeatures -XX:+ResourceManagement

       -XX:ResourceManagementSampleInterval=value (milliseconds)
           Sets the parameter that controls the sampling interval for Resource Management measurements, in
           milliseconds.

           This option can be used only when Resource Management is enabled (that is, the -XX:+ResourceManagement
           option is specified).

       -XX:SharedArchiveFile=path
           Specifies the path and name of the class data sharing (CDS) archive file

       -XX:SharedClassListFile=file_name
           Specifies the text file that contains the names of the class files to store in the class data sharing
           (CDS) archive. This file contains the full name of one class file per line, except slashes (/) replace
           dots (.). For example, to specify the classes java.lang.Object and hello.Main, create a text file that
           contains the following two lines:

               java/lang/Object
               hello/Main

           The class files that you specify in this text file should include the classes that are commonly used by
           the application. They may include any classes from the application, extension, or bootstrap class paths.

       -XX:+ShowMessageBoxOnError
           Enables displaying of a dialog box when the JVM experiences an irrecoverable error. This prevents the JVM
           from exiting and keeps the process active so that you can attach a debugger to it to investigate the
           cause of the error. By default, this option is disabled.

       -XX:StartFlightRecording=parameter=value
           Starts a JFR recording for the Java application. This is a commercial feature that works in conjunction
           with the -XX:+UnlockCommercialFeatures option. This option is equivalent to the JFR.start diagnostic
           command that starts a recording during runtime. You can set the following parameters when starting a JFR
           recording:

           compress={true|false}
               Specifies whether to compress the JFR recording log file (of type JFR) on the disk using the gzip
               file compression utility. This parameter is valid only if the filename parameter is specified. By
               default it is set to false (recording is not compressed). To enable compression, set the parameter to
               true.

           defaultrecording={true|false}
               Specifies whether the recording is a continuous background recording or if it runs for a limited
               time. By default, this parameter is set to false (recording runs for a limited time). To make the
               recording run continuously, set the parameter to true.

           delay=time
               Specifies the delay between the Java application launch time and the start of the recording. Append s
               to specify the time in seconds, m for minutes, h for hours, or d for days (for example, specifying
               10m means 10 minutes). By default, there is no delay, and this parameter is set to 0.

           dumponexit={true|false}
               Specifies whether a dump file of JFR data should be generated when the JVM terminates in a controlled
               manner. By default, this parameter is set to false (dump file on exit is not generated). To enable
               it, set the parameter to true.

               The dump file is written to the location defined by the filename parameter.

               Example:

                   -XX:StartFlightRecording=name=test,filename=D:\test.jfr,dumponexit=true

           duration=time
               Specifies the duration of the recording. Append s to specify the time in seconds, m for minutes, h
               for hours, or d for days (for example, specifying 5h means 5 hours). By default, the duration is not
               limited, and this parameter is set to 0.

           filename=path
               Specifies the path and name of the JFR recording log file.

           name=identifier
               Specifies the identifier for the JFR recording. By default, it is set to Recording x.

           maxage=time
               Specifies the maximum age of disk data to keep for the default recording. Append s to specify the
               time in seconds, m for minutes, h for hours, or d for days (for example, specifying 30s means 30
               seconds). By default, the maximum age is set to 15 minutes (15m).

           maxsize=size
               Specifies the maximum size (in bytes) of disk data to keep for the default recording. Append k or K,
               to specify the size in KB, m or M to specify the size in MB, g or G to specify the size in GB. By
               default, the maximum size of disk data is not limited, and this parameter is set to 0.

           settings=path
               Specifies the path and name of the event settings file (of type JFC). By default, the default.jfc
               file is used, which is located in JAVA_HOME/jre/lib/jfr.

           You can specify values for multiple parameters by separating them with a comma. For example, to save the
           recording to test.jfr in the current working directory, and instruct JFR to compress the log file,
           specify the following:

               -XX:StartFlightRecording=filename=test.jfr,compress=true


       -XX:ThreadStackSize=size
           Sets the thread stack size (in bytes). Append the letter k or K to indicate kilobytes, m or M to indicate
           megabytes, g or G to indicate gigabytes. The default value depends on the platform:

           ·   Linux/ARM (32-bit): 320 KB

           ·   Linux/i386 (32-bit): 320 KB

           ·   Linux/x64 (64-bit): 1024 KB

           ·   OS X (64-bit): 1024 KB

           ·   Oracle Solaris/i386 (32-bit): 320 KB

           ·   Oracle Solaris/x64 (64-bit): 1024 KB

           The following examples show how to set the thread stack size to 1024 KB in different units:

               -XX:ThreadStackSize=1m
               -XX:ThreadStackSize=1024k
               -XX:ThreadStackSize=1048576

           This option is equivalent to -Xss.

       -XX:+TraceClassLoading
           Enables tracing of classes as they are loaded. By default, this option is disabled and classes are not
           traced.

       -XX:+TraceClassLoadingPreorder
           Enables tracing of all loaded classes in the order in which they are referenced. By default, this option
           is disabled and classes are not traced.

       -XX:+TraceClassResolution
           Enables tracing of constant pool resolutions. By default, this option is disabled and constant pool
           resolutions are not traced.

       -XX:+TraceClassUnloading
           Enables tracing of classes as they are unloaded. By default, this option is disabled and classes are not
           traced.

       -XX:+TraceLoaderConstraints
           Enables tracing of the loader constraints recording. By default, this option is disabled and loader
           constraints recording is not traced.

       -XX:+UnlockCommercialFeatures
           Enables the use of commercial features. Commercial features are included with Oracle Java SE Advanced or
           Oracle Java SE Suite packages, as defined on the Java SE Products page at
           http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/terms/products/index.html

           By default, this option is disabled and the JVM runs without the commercial features. Once they were
           enabled for a JVM process, it is not possible to disable their use for that process.

           If this option is not provided, commercial features can still be unlocked in a running JVM by using the
           appropriate jcmd diagnostic commands.

       -XX:+UseAltSigs
           Enables the use of alternative signals instead of SIGUSR1 and SIGUSR2 for JVM internal signals. By
           default, this option is disabled and alternative signals are not used. This option is equivalent to
           -Xusealtsigs.

       -XX:+UseAppCDS
           Enables application class data sharing (AppCDS). To use AppCDS, you must also specify values for the
           options -XX:SharedClassListFile and -XX:SharedArchiveFile during both CDS dump time (see the option
           -Xshare:dump) and application run time.

           This is a commercial feature that requires you to also specify the -XX:+UnlockCommercialFeatures option.
           This is also an experimental feature; it may change in future releases.

           See "Application Class Data Sharing".

       -XX:-UseBiasedLocking
           Disables the use of biased locking. Some applications with significant amounts of uncontended
           synchronization may attain significant speedups with this flag enabled, whereas applications with certain
           patterns of locking may see slowdowns. For more information about the biased locking technique, see the
           example in Java Tuning White Paper at
           http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/tuning-139912.html#section4.2.5

           By default, this option is enabled.

       -XX:-UseCompressedOops
           Disables the use of compressed pointers. By default, this option is enabled, and compressed pointers are
           used when Java heap sizes are less than 32 GB. When this option is enabled, object references are
           represented as 32-bit offsets instead of 64-bit pointers, which typically increases performance when
           running the application with Java heap sizes less than 32 GB. This option works only for 64-bit JVMs.

           It is also possible to use compressed pointers when Java heap sizes are greater than 32GB. See the
           -XX:ObjectAlignmentInBytes option.

       -XX:+UseHugeTLBFS
           This option for Linux is the equivalent of specifying -XX:+UseLargePages. This option is disabled by
           default. This option pre-allocates all large pages up-front, when memory is reserved; consequently the
           JVM cannot dynamically grow or shrink large pages memory areas; see -XX:UseTransparentHugePages if you
           want this behavior.

           For more information, see "Large Pages".

       -XX:+UseLargePages
           Enables the use of large page memory. By default, this option is disabled and large page memory is not
           used.

           For more information, see "Large Pages".

       -XX:+UseMembar
           Enables issuing of membars on thread state transitions. This option is disabled by default on all
           platforms except ARM servers, where it is enabled. (It is recommended that you do not disable this option
           on ARM servers.)

       -XX:+UsePerfData
           Enables the perfdata feature. This option is enabled by default to allow JVM monitoring and performance
           testing. Disabling it suppresses the creation of the hsperfdata_userid directories. To disable the
           perfdata feature, specify -XX:-UsePerfData.

       -XX:+UseTransparentHugePages
           On Linux, enables the use of large pages that can dynamically grow or shrink. This option is disabled by
           default. You may encounter performance problems with transparent huge pages as the OS moves other pages
           around to create huge pages; this option is made available for experimentation.

           For more information, see "Large Pages".

       -XX:+AllowUserSignalHandlers
           Enables installation of signal handlers by the application. By default, this option is disabled and the
           application is not allowed to install signal handlers.

   Advanced JIT Compiler Options
       These options control the dynamic just-in-time (JIT) compilation performed by the Java HotSpot VM.

       -XX:+AggressiveOpts
           Enables the use of aggressive performance optimization features, which are expected to become default in
           upcoming releases. By default, this option is disabled and experimental performance features are not
           used.

       -XX:AllocateInstancePrefetchLines=lines
           Sets the number of lines to prefetch ahead of the instance allocation pointer. By default, the number of
           lines to prefetch is set to 1:

               -XX:AllocateInstancePrefetchLines=1

           Only the Java HotSpot Server VM supports this option.

       -XX:AllocatePrefetchDistance=size
           Sets the size (in bytes) of the prefetch distance for object allocation. Memory about to be written with
           the value of new objects is prefetched up to this distance starting from the address of the last
           allocated object. Each Java thread has its own allocation point.

           Negative values denote that prefetch distance is chosen based on the platform. Positive values are bytes
           to prefetch. Append the letter k or K to indicate kilobytes, m or M to indicate megabytes, g or G to
           indicate gigabytes. The default value is set to -1.

           The following example shows how to set the prefetch distance to 1024 bytes:

               -XX:AllocatePrefetchDistance=1024

           Only the Java HotSpot Server VM supports this option.

       -XX:AllocatePrefetchInstr=instruction
           Sets the prefetch instruction to prefetch ahead of the allocation pointer. Only the Java HotSpot Server
           VM supports this option. Possible values are from 0 to 3. The actual instructions behind the values
           depend on the platform. By default, the prefetch instruction is set to 0:

               -XX:AllocatePrefetchInstr=0

           Only the Java HotSpot Server VM supports this option.

       -XX:AllocatePrefetchLines=lines
           Sets the number of cache lines to load after the last object allocation by using the prefetch
           instructions generated in compiled code. The default value is 1 if the last allocated object was an
           instance, and 3 if it was an array.

           The following example shows how to set the number of loaded cache lines to 5:

               -XX:AllocatePrefetchLines=5

           Only the Java HotSpot Server VM supports this option.

       -XX:AllocatePrefetchStepSize=size
           Sets the step size (in bytes) for sequential prefetch instructions. Append the letter k or K to indicate
           kilobytes, m or M to indicate megabytes, g or G to indicate gigabytes. By default, the step size is set
           to 16 bytes:

               -XX:AllocatePrefetchStepSize=16

           Only the Java HotSpot Server VM supports this option.

       -XX:AllocatePrefetchStyle=style
           Sets the generated code style for prefetch instructions. The style argument is an integer from 0 to 3:

           0
               Do not generate prefetch instructions.

           1
               Execute prefetch instructions after each allocation. This is the default parameter.

           2
               Use the thread-local allocation block (TLAB) watermark pointer to determine when prefetch
               instructions are executed.

           3
               Use BIS instruction on SPARC for allocation prefetch.

           Only the Java HotSpot Server VM supports this option.

       -XX:+BackgroundCompilation
           Enables background compilation. This option is enabled by default. To disable background compilation,
           specify -XX:-BackgroundCompilation (this is equivalent to specifying -Xbatch).

       -XX:CICompilerCount=threads
           Sets the number of compiler threads to use for compilation. By default, the number of threads is set to 2
           for the server JVM, to 1 for the client JVM, and it scales to the number of cores if tiered compilation
           is used. The following example shows how to set the number of threads to 2:

               -XX:CICompilerCount=2


       -XX:CodeCacheMinimumFreeSpace=size
           Sets the minimum free space (in bytes) required for compilation. Append the letter k or K to indicate
           kilobytes, m or M to indicate megabytes, g or G to indicate gigabytes. When less than the minimum free
           space remains, compiling stops. By default, this option is set to 500 KB. The following example shows how
           to set the minimum free space to 1024 MB:

               -XX:CodeCacheMinimumFreeSpace=1024m


       -XX:CompileCommand=command,method[,option]
           Specifies a command to perform on a method. For example, to exclude the indexOf() method of the String
           class from being compiled, use the following:

               -XX:CompileCommand=exclude,java/lang/String.indexOf

           Note that the full class name is specified, including all packages and subpackages separated by a slash
           (/). For easier cut and paste operations, it is also possible to use the method name format produced by
           the -XX:+PrintCompilation and -XX:+LogCompilation options:

               -XX:CompileCommand=exclude,java.lang.String::indexOf

           If the method is specified without the signature, the command will be applied to all methods with the
           specified name. However, you can also specify the signature of the method in the class file format. In
           this case, you should enclose the arguments in quotation marks, because otherwise the shell treats the
           semicolon as command end. For example, if you want to exclude only the indexOf(String) method of the
           String class from being compiled, use the following:

               -XX:CompileCommand="exclude,java/lang/String.indexOf,(Ljava/lang/String;)I"

           You can also use the asterisk (*) as a wildcard for class and method names. For example, to exclude all
           indexOf() methods in all classes from being compiled, use the following:

               -XX:CompileCommand=exclude,*.indexOf

           The commas and periods are aliases for spaces, making it easier to pass compiler commands through a
           shell. You can pass arguments to -XX:CompileCommand using spaces as separators by enclosing the argument
           in quotation marks:

               -XX:CompileCommand="exclude java/lang/String indexOf"

           Note that after parsing the commands passed on the command line using the -XX:CompileCommand options, the
           JIT compiler then reads commands from the .hotspot_compiler file. You can add commands to this file or
           specify a different file using the -XX:CompileCommandFile option.

           To add several commands, either specify the -XX:CompileCommand option multiple times, or separate each
           argument with the newline separator (\n). The following commands are available:

           break
               Set a breakpoint when debugging the JVM to stop at the beginning of compilation of the specified
               method.

           compileonly
               Exclude all methods from compilation except for the specified method. As an alternative, you can use
               the -XX:CompileOnly option, which allows to specify several methods.

           dontinline
               Prevent inlining of the specified method.

           exclude
               Exclude the specified method from compilation.

           help
               Print a help message for the -XX:CompileCommand option.

           inline
               Attempt to inline the specified method.

           log
               Exclude compilation logging (with the -XX:+LogCompilation option) for all methods except for the
               specified method. By default, logging is performed for all compiled methods.

           option
               This command can be used to pass a JIT compilation option to the specified method in place of the
               last argument (option). The compilation option is set at the end, after the method name. For example,
               to enable the BlockLayoutByFrequency option for the append() method of the StringBuffer class, use
               the following:

                   -XX:CompileCommand=option,java/lang/StringBuffer.append,BlockLayoutByFrequency

               You can specify multiple compilation options, separated by commas or spaces.

           print
               Print generated assembler code after compilation of the specified method.

           quiet
               Do not print the compile commands. By default, the commands that you specify with the
               -XX:CompileCommand option are printed; for example, if you exclude from compilation the indexOf()
               method of the String class, then the following will be printed to standard output:

                   CompilerOracle: exclude java/lang/String.indexOf

               You can suppress this by specifying the -XX:CompileCommand=quiet option before other
               -XX:CompileCommand options.

       -XX:CompileCommandFile=filename
           Sets the file from which JIT compiler commands are read. By default, the .hotspot_compiler file is used
           to store commands performed by the JIT compiler.

           Each line in the command file represents a command, a class name, and a method name for which the command
           is used. For example, this line prints assembly code for the toString() method of the String class:

               print java/lang/String toString

           For more information about specifying the commands for the JIT compiler to perform on methods, see the
           -XX:CompileCommand option.

       -XX:CompileOnly=methods
           Sets the list of methods (separated by commas) to which compilation should be restricted. Only the
           specified methods will be compiled. Specify each method with the full class name (including the packages
           and subpackages). For example, to compile only the length() method of the String class and the size()
           method of the List class, use the following:

               -XX:CompileOnly=java/lang/String.length,java/util/List.size

           Note that the full class name is specified, including all packages and subpackages separated by a slash
           (/). For easier cut and paste operations, it is also possible to use the method name format produced by
           the -XX:+PrintCompilation and -XX:+LogCompilation options:

               -XX:CompileOnly=java.lang.String::length,java.util.List::size

           Although wildcards are not supported, you can specify only the class or package name to compile all
           methods in that class or package, as well as specify just the method to compile methods with this name in
           any class:

               -XX:CompileOnly=java/lang/String
               -XX:CompileOnly=java/lang
               -XX:CompileOnly=.length


       -XX:CompileThreshold=invocations
           Sets the number of interpreted method invocations before compilation. By default, in the server JVM, the
           JIT compiler performs 10,000 interpreted method invocations to gather information for efficient
           compilation. For the client JVM, the default setting is 1,500 invocations. This option is ignored when
           tiered compilation is enabled; see the option -XX:+TieredCompilation. The following example shows how to
           set the number of interpreted method invocations to 5,000:

               -XX:CompileThreshold=5000

           You can completely disable interpretation of Java methods before compilation by specifying the -Xcomp
           option.

       -XX:+DoEscapeAnalysis
           Enables the use of escape analysis. This option is enabled by default. To disable the use of escape
           analysis, specify -XX:-DoEscapeAnalysis. Only the Java HotSpot Server VM supports this option.

       -XX:InitialCodeCacheSize=size
           Sets the initial code cache size (in bytes). Append the letter k or K to indicate kilobytes, m or M to
           indicate megabytes, g or G to indicate gigabytes. The default value is set to 500 KB. The initial code
           cache size should be not less than the system's minimal memory page size. The following example shows how
           to set the initial code cache size to 32 KB:

               -XX:InitialCodeCacheSize=32k


       -XX:+Inline
           Enables method inlining. This option is enabled by default to increase performance. To disable method
           inlining, specify -XX:-Inline.

       -XX:InlineSmallCode=size
           Sets the maximum code size (in bytes) for compiled methods that should be inlined. Append the letter k or
           K to indicate kilobytes, m or M to indicate megabytes, g or G to indicate gigabytes. Only compiled
           methods with the size smaller than the specified size will be inlined. By default, the maximum code size
           is set to 1000 bytes:

               -XX:InlineSmallCode=1000


       -XX:+LogCompilation
           Enables logging of compilation activity to a file named hotspot.log in the current working directory. You
           can specify a different log file path and name using the -XX:LogFile option.

           By default, this option is disabled and compilation activity is not logged. The -XX:+LogCompilation
           option has to be used together with the -XX:UnlockDiagnosticVMOptions option that unlocks diagnostic JVM
           options.

           You can enable verbose diagnostic output with a message printed to the console every time a method is
           compiled by using the -XX:+PrintCompilation option.

       -XX:MaxInlineSize=size
           Sets the maximum bytecode size (in bytes) of a method to be inlined. Append the letter k or K to indicate
           kilobytes, m or M to indicate megabytes, g or G to indicate gigabytes. By default, the maximum bytecode
           size is set to 35 bytes:

               -XX:MaxInlineSize=35


       -XX:MaxNodeLimit=nodes
           Sets the maximum number of nodes to be used during single method compilation. By default, the maximum
           number of nodes is set to 65,000:

               -XX:MaxNodeLimit=65000


       -XX:MaxTrivialSize=size
           Sets the maximum bytecode size (in bytes) of a trivial method to be inlined. Append the letter k or K to
           indicate kilobytes, m or M to indicate megabytes, g or G to indicate gigabytes. By default, the maximum
           bytecode size of a trivial method is set to 6 bytes:

               -XX:MaxTrivialSize=6


       -XX:+OptimizeStringConcat
           Enables the optimization of String concatenation operations. This option is enabled by default. To
           disable the optimization of String concatenation operations, specify -XX:-OptimizeStringConcat. Only the
           Java HotSpot Server VM supports this option.

       -XX:+PrintAssembly
           Enables printing of assembly code for bytecoded and native methods by using the external disassembler.so
           library. This enables you to see the generated code, which may help you to diagnose performance issues.

           By default, this option is disabled and assembly code is not printed. The -XX:+PrintAssembly option has
           to be used together with the -XX:UnlockDiagnosticVMOptions option that unlocks diagnostic JVM options.

       -XX:+PrintCompilation
           Enables verbose diagnostic output from the JVM by printing a message to the console every time a method
           is compiled. This enables you to see which methods actually get compiled. By default, this option is
           disabled and diagnostic output is not printed.

           You can also log compilation activity to a file by using the -XX:+LogCompilation option.

       -XX:+PrintInlining
           Enables printing of inlining decisions. This enables you to see which methods are getting inlined.

           By default, this option is disabled and inlining information is not printed. The -XX:+PrintInlining
           option has to be used together with the -XX:+UnlockDiagnosticVMOptions option that unlocks diagnostic JVM
           options.

       -XX:ReservedCodeCacheSize=size
           Sets the maximum code cache size (in bytes) for JIT-compiled code. Append the letter k or K to indicate
           kilobytes, m or M to indicate megabytes, g or G to indicate gigabytes. The default maximum code cache
           size is 240 MB; if you disable tiered compilation with the option -XX:-TieredCompilation, then the
           default size is 48 MB. This option has a limit of 2 GB; otherwise, an error is generated. The maximum
           code cache size should not be less than the initial code cache size; see the option
           -XX:InitialCodeCacheSize. This option is equivalent to -Xmaxjitcodesize.

       -XX:RTMAbortRatio=abort_ratio
           The RTM abort ratio is specified as a percentage (%) of all executed RTM transactions. If a number of
           aborted transactions becomes greater than this ratio, then the compiled code will be deoptimized. This
           ratio is used when the -XX:+UseRTMDeopt option is enabled. The default value of this option is 50. This
           means that the compiled code will be deoptimized if 50% of all transactions are aborted.

       -XX:RTMRetryCount=number_of_retries
           RTM locking code will be retried, when it is aborted or busy, the number of times specified by this
           option before falling back to the normal locking mechanism. The default value for this option is 5. The
           -XX:UseRTMLocking option must be enabled.

       -XX:-TieredCompilation
           Disables the use of tiered compilation. By default, this option is enabled. Only the Java HotSpot Server
           VM supports this option.

       -XX:+UseAES
           Enables hardware-based AES intrinsics for Intel, AMD, and SPARC hardware. Intel Westmere (2010 and
           newer), AMD Bulldozer (2011 and newer), and SPARC (T4 and newer) are the supported hardware. UseAES is
           used in conjunction with UseAESIntrinsics.

       -XX:+UseAESIntrinsics
           UseAES and UseAESIntrinsics flags are enabled by default and are supported only for Java HotSpot Server
           VM 32-bit and 64-bit. To disable hardware-based AES intrinsics, specify -XX:-UseAES
           -XX:-UseAESIntrinsics. For example, to enable hardware AES, use the following flags:

               -XX:+UseAES -XX:+UseAESIntrinsics

           To support UseAES and UseAESIntrinsics flags for 32-bit and 64-bit use -server option to choose Java
           HotSpot Server VM. These flags are not supported on Client VM.

       -XX:+UseCodeCacheFlushing
           Enables flushing of the code cache before shutting down the compiler. This option is enabled by default.
           To disable flushing of the code cache before shutting down the compiler, specify
           -XX:-UseCodeCacheFlushing.

       -XX:+UseCondCardMark
           Enables checking of whether the card is already marked before updating the card table. This option is
           disabled by default and should only be used on machines with multiple sockets, where it will increase
           performance of Java applications that rely heavily on concurrent operations. Only the Java HotSpot Server
           VM supports this option.

       -XX:+UseRTMDeopt
           Auto-tunes RTM locking depending on the abort ratio. This ratio is specified by -XX:RTMAbortRatio option.
           If the number of aborted transactions exceeds the abort ratio, then the method containing the lock will
           be deoptimized and recompiled with all locks as normal locks. This option is disabled by default. The
           -XX:+UseRTMLocking option must be enabled.

       -XX:+UseRTMLocking
           Generate Restricted Transactional Memory (RTM) locking code for all inflated locks, with the normal
           locking mechanism as the fallback handler. This option is disabled by default. Options related to RTM are
           only available for the Java HotSpot Server VM on x86 CPUs that support Transactional Synchronization
           Extensions (TSX).

           RTM is part of Intel's TSX, which is an x86 instruction set extension and facilitates the creation of
           multithreaded applications. RTM introduces the new instructions XBEGIN, XABORT, XEND, and XTEST. The
           XBEGIN and XEND instructions enclose a set of instructions to run as a transaction. If no conflict is
           found when running the transaction, the memory and register modifications are committed together at the
           XEND instruction. The XABORT instruction can be used to explicitly abort a transaction and the XEND
           instruction to check if a set of instructions are being run in a transaction.

           A lock on a transaction is inflated when another thread tries to access the same transaction, thereby
           blocking the thread that did not originally request access to the transaction. RTM requires that a
           fallback set of operations be specified in case a transaction aborts or fails. An RTM lock is a lock that
           has been delegated to the TSX's system.

           RTM improves performance for highly contended locks with low conflict in a critical region (which is code
           that must not be accessed by more than one thread concurrently). RTM also improves the performance of
           coarse-grain locking, which typically does not perform well in multithreaded applications. (Coarse-grain
           locking is the strategy of holding locks for long periods to minimize the overhead of taking and
           releasing locks, while fine-grained locking is the strategy of trying to achieve maximum parallelism by
           locking only when necessary and unlocking as soon as possible.) Also, for lightly contended locks that
           are used by different threads, RTM can reduce false cache line sharing, also known as cache line
           ping-pong. This occurs when multiple threads from different processors are accessing different resources,
           but the resources share the same cache line. As a result, the processors repeatedly invalidate the cache
           lines of other processors, which forces them to read from main memory instead of their cache.

       -XX:+UseSHA
           Enables hardware-based intrinsics for SHA crypto hash functions for SPARC hardware.  UseSHA is used in
           conjunction with the UseSHA1Intrinsics, UseSHA256Intrinsics, and UseSHA512Intrinsics options.

           The UseSHA and UseSHA*Intrinsics flags are enabled by default, and are supported only for Java HotSpot
           Server VM 64-bit on SPARC T4 and newer.

           This feature is only applicable when using the sun.security.provider.Sun provider for SHA operations.

           To disable all hardware-based SHA intrinsics, specify -XX:-UseSHA. To disable only a particular SHA
           intrinsic, use the appropriate corresponding option. For example: -XX:-UseSHA256Intrinsics.

       -XX:+UseSHA1Intrinsics
           Enables intrinsics for SHA-1 crypto hash function.

       -XX:+UseSHA256Intrinsics
           Enables intrinsics for SHA-224 and SHA-256 crypto hash functions.

       -XX:+UseSHA512Intrinsics
           Enables intrinsics for SHA-384 and SHA-512 crypto hash functions.

       -XX:+UseSuperWord
           Enables the transformation of scalar operations into superword operations. This option is enabled by
           default. To disable the transformation of scalar operations into superword operations, specify
           -XX:-UseSuperWord. Only the Java HotSpot Server VM supports this option.

   Advanced Serviceability Options
       These options provide the ability to gather system information and perform extensive debugging.

       -XX:+ExtendedDTraceProbes
           Enables additional dtrace tool probes that impact the performance. By default, this option is disabled
           and dtrace performs only standard probes.

       -XX:+HeapDumpOnOutOfMemory
           Enables the dumping of the Java heap to a file in the current directory by using the heap profiler
           (HPROF) when a java.lang.OutOfMemoryError exception is thrown. You can explicitly set the heap dump file
           path and name using the -XX:HeapDumpPath option. By default, this option is disabled and the heap is not
           dumped when an OutOfMemoryError exception is thrown.

       -XX:HeapDumpPath=path
           Sets the path and file name for writing the heap dump provided by the heap profiler (HPROF) when the
           -XX:+HeapDumpOnOutOfMemoryError option is set. By default, the file is created in the current working
           directory, and it is named java_pidpid.hprof where pid is the identifier of the process that caused the
           error. The following example shows how to set the default file explicitly (%p represents the current
           process identificator):

               -XX:HeapDumpPath=./java_pid%p.hprof

           The following example shows how to set the heap dump file to /var/log/java/java_heapdump.hprof:

               -XX:HeapDumpPath=/var/log/java/java_heapdump.hprof


       -XX:LogFile=path
           Sets the path and file name where log data is written. By default, the file is created in the current
           working directory, and it is named hotspot.log.

           The following example shows how to set the log file to /var/log/java/hotspot.log:

               -XX:LogFile=/var/log/java/hotspot.log


       -XX:+PrintClassHistogram
           Enables printing of a class instance histogram after a Control+C event (SIGTERM). By default, this option
           is disabled.

           Setting this option is equivalent to running the jmap -histo command, or the jcmd pid GC.class_histogram
           command, where pid is the current Java process identifier.

       -XX:+PrintConcurrentLocks
           Enables printing of locks after a event. By default, this option is disabled.

           Enables printing of java.util.concurrent locks after a Control+C event (SIGTERM). By default, this option
           is disabled.

           Setting this option is equivalent to running the jstack -l command or the jcmd pid Thread.print -l
           command, where pid is the current Java process identifier.

       -XX:+UnlockDiagnosticVMOptions
           Unlocks the options intended for diagnosing the JVM. By default, this option is disabled and diagnostic
           options are not available.

   Advanced Garbage Collection Options
       These options control how garbage collection (GC) is performed by the Java HotSpot VM.

       -XX:+AggressiveHeap
           Enables Java heap optimization. This sets various parameters to be optimal for long-running jobs with
           intensive memory allocation, based on the configuration of the computer (RAM and CPU). By default, the
           option is disabled and the heap is not optimized.

       -XX:+AlwaysPreTouch
           Enables touching of every page on the Java heap during JVM initialization. This gets all pages into the
           memory before entering the main() method. The option can be used in testing to simulate a long-running
           system with all virtual memory mapped to physical memory. By default, this option is disabled and all
           pages are committed as JVM heap space fills.

       -XX:+CMSClassUnloadingEnabled
           Enables class unloading when using the concurrent mark-sweep (CMS) garbage collector. This option is
           enabled by default. To disable class unloading for the CMS garbage collector, specify
           -XX:-CMSClassUnloadingEnabled.

       -XX:CMSExpAvgFactor=percent
           Sets the percentage of time (0 to 100) used to weight the current sample when computing exponential
           averages for the concurrent collection statistics. By default, the exponential averages factor is set to
           25%. The following example shows how to set the factor to 15%:

               -XX:CMSExpAvgFactor=15


       -XX:CMSInitiatingOccupancyFraction=percent
           Sets the percentage of the old generation occupancy (0 to 100) at which to start a CMS collection cycle.
           The default value is set to -1. Any negative value (including the default) implies that
           -XX:CMSTriggerRatio is used to define the value of the initiating occupancy fraction.

           The following example shows how to set the occupancy fraction to 20%:

               -XX:CMSInitiatingOccupancyFraction=20


       -XX:+CMSScavengeBeforeRemark
           Enables scavenging attempts before the CMS remark step. By default, this option is disabled.

       -XX:CMSTriggerRatio=percent
           Sets the percentage (0 to 100) of the value specified by -XX:MinHeapFreeRatio that is allocated before a
           CMS collection cycle commences. The default value is set to 80%.

           The following example shows how to set the occupancy fraction to 75%:

               -XX:CMSTriggerRatio=75


       -XX:ConcGCThreads=threads
           Sets the number of threads used for concurrent GC. The default value depends on the number of CPUs
           available to the JVM.

           For example, to set the number of threads for concurrent GC to 2, specify the following option:

               -XX:ConcGCThreads=2


       -XX:+DisableExplicitGC
           Enables the option that disables processing of calls to System.gc(). This option is disabled by default,
           meaning that calls to System.gc() are processed. If processing of calls to System.gc() is disabled, the
           JVM still performs GC when necessary.

       -XX:+ExplicitGCInvokesConcurrent
           Enables invoking of concurrent GC by using the System.gc() request. This option is disabled by default
           and can be enabled only together with the -XX:+UseConcMarkSweepGC option.

       -XX:+ExplicitGCInvokesConcurrentAndUnloadsClasses
           Enables invoking of concurrent GC by using the System.gc() request and unloading of classes during the
           concurrent GC cycle. This option is disabled by default and can be enabled only together with the
           -XX:+UseConcMarkSweepGC option.

       -XX:G1HeapRegionSize=size
           Sets the size of the regions into which the Java heap is subdivided when using the garbage-first (G1)
           collector. The value can be between 1 MB and 32 MB. The default region size is determined ergonomically
           based on the heap size.

           The following example shows how to set the size of the subdivisions to 16 MB:

               -XX:G1HeapRegionSize=16m


       -XX:+G1PrintHeapRegions
           Enables the printing of information about which regions are allocated and which are reclaimed by the G1
           collector. By default, this option is disabled.

       -XX:G1ReservePercent=percent
           Sets the percentage of the heap (0 to 50) that is reserved as a false ceiling to reduce the possibility
           of promotion failure for the G1 collector. By default, this option is set to 10%.

           The following example shows how to set the reserved heap to 20%:

               -XX:G1ReservePercent=20


       -XX:InitialHeapSize=size
           Sets the initial size (in bytes) of the memory allocation pool. This value must be either 0, or a
           multiple of 1024 and greater than 1 MB. Append the letter k or K to indicate kilobytes, m or M to
           indicate megabytes, g or G to indicate gigabytes. The default value is chosen at runtime based on system
           configuration. See the section "Ergonomics" in Java SE HotSpot Virtual Machine Garbage Collection Tuning
           Guide at http://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/technotes/guides/vm/gctuning/index.html.

           The following examples show how to set the size of allocated memory to 6 MB using various units:

               -XX:InitialHeapSize=6291456
               -XX:InitialHeapSize=6144k
               -XX:InitialHeapSize=6m

           If you set this option to 0, then the initial size will be set as the sum of the sizes allocated for the
           old generation and the young generation. The size of the heap for the young generation can be set using
           the -XX:NewSize option.

       -XX:InitialSurvivorRatio=ratio
           Sets the initial survivor space ratio used by the throughput garbage collector (which is enabled by the
           -XX:+UseParallelGC and/or -XX:+UseParallelOldGC options). Adaptive sizing is enabled by default with the
           throughput garbage collector by using the -XX:+UseParallelGC and -XX:+UseParallelOldGC options, and
           survivor space is resized according to the application behavior, starting with the initial value. If
           adaptive sizing is disabled (using the -XX:-UseAdaptiveSizePolicy option), then the -XX:SurvivorRatio
           option should be used to set the size of the survivor space for the entire execution of the application.

           The following formula can be used to calculate the initial size of survivor space (S) based on the size
           of the young generation (Y), and the initial survivor space ratio (R):

               S=Y/(R+2)

           The 2 in the equation denotes two survivor spaces. The larger the value specified as the initial survivor
           space ratio, the smaller the initial survivor space size.

           By default, the initial survivor space ratio is set to 8. If the default value for the young generation
           space size is used (2 MB), the initial size of the survivor space will be 0.2 MB.

           The following example shows how to set the initial survivor space ratio to 4:

               -XX:InitialSurvivorRatio=4


       -XX:InitiatingHeapOccupancyPercent=percent
           Sets the percentage of the heap occupancy (0 to 100) at which to start a concurrent GC cycle. It is used
           by garbage collectors that trigger a concurrent GC cycle based on the occupancy of the entire heap, not
           just one of the generations (for example, the G1 garbage collector).

           By default, the initiating value is set to 45%. A value of 0 implies nonstop GC cycles. The following
           example shows how to set the initiating heap occupancy to 75%:

               -XX:InitiatingHeapOccupancyPercent=75


       -XX:MaxGCPauseMillis=time
           Sets a target for the maximum GC pause time (in milliseconds). This is a soft goal, and the JVM will make
           its best effort to achieve it. By default, there is no maximum pause time value.

           The following example shows how to set the maximum target pause time to 500 ms:

               -XX:MaxGCPauseMillis=500


       -XX:MaxHeapSize=size
           Sets the maximum size (in byes) of the memory allocation pool. This value must be a multiple of 1024 and
           greater than 2 MB. Append the letter k or K to indicate kilobytes, m or M to indicate megabytes, g or G
           to indicate gigabytes. The default value is chosen at runtime based on system configuration. For server
           deployments, -XX:InitialHeapSize and -XX:MaxHeapSize are often set to the same value. See the section
           "Ergonomics" in Java SE HotSpot Virtual Machine Garbage Collection Tuning Guide at
           http://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/technotes/guides/vm/gctuning/index.html.

           The following examples show how to set the maximum allowed size of allocated memory to 80 MB using
           various units:

               -XX:MaxHeapSize=83886080
               -XX:MaxHeapSize=81920k
               -XX:MaxHeapSize=80m

           On Oracle Solaris 7 and Oracle Solaris 8 SPARC platforms, the upper limit for this value is approximately
           4,000 MB minus overhead amounts. On Oracle Solaris 2.6 and x86 platforms, the upper limit is
           approximately 2,000 MB minus overhead amounts. On Linux platforms, the upper limit is approximately 2,000
           MB minus overhead amounts.

           The -XX:MaxHeapSize option is equivalent to -Xmx.

       -XX:MaxHeapFreeRatio=percent
           Sets the maximum allowed percentage of free heap space (0 to 100) after a GC event. If free heap space
           expands above this value, then the heap will be shrunk. By default, this value is set to 70%.

           The following example shows how to set the maximum free heap ratio to 75%:

               -XX:MaxHeapFreeRatio=75


       -XX:MaxMetaspaceSize=size
           Sets the maximum amount of native memory that can be allocated for class metadata. By default, the size
           is not limited. The amount of metadata for an application depends on the application itself, other
           running applications, and the amount of memory available on the system.

           The following example shows how to set the maximum class metadata size to 256 MB:

               -XX:MaxMetaspaceSize=256m


       -XX:MaxNewSize=size
           Sets the maximum size (in bytes) of the heap for the young generation (nursery). The default value is set
           ergonomically.

       -XX:MaxTenuringThreshold=threshold
           Sets the maximum tenuring threshold for use in adaptive GC sizing. The largest value is 15. The default
           value is 15 for the parallel (throughput) collector, and 6 for the CMS collector.

           The following example shows how to set the maximum tenuring threshold to 10:

               -XX:MaxTenuringThreshold=10


       -XX:MetaspaceSize=size
           Sets the size of the allocated class metadata space that will trigger a garbage collection the first time
           it is exceeded. This threshold for a garbage collection is increased or decreased depending on the amount
           of metadata used. The default size depends on the platform.

       -XX:MinHeapFreeRatio=percent
           Sets the minimum allowed percentage of free heap space (0 to 100) after a GC event. If free heap space
           falls below this value, then the heap will be expanded. By default, this value is set to 40%.

           The following example shows how to set the minimum free heap ratio to 25%:

               -XX:MinHeapFreeRatio=25


       -XX:NewRatio=ratio
           Sets the ratio between young and old generation sizes. By default, this option is set to 2. The following
           example shows how to set the young/old ratio to 1:

               -XX:NewRatio=1


       -XX:NewSize=size
           Sets the initial size (in bytes) of the heap for the young generation (nursery). Append the letter k or K
           to indicate kilobytes, m or M to indicate megabytes, g or G to indicate gigabytes.

           The young generation region of the heap is used for new objects. GC is performed in this region more
           often than in other regions. If the size for the young generation is too low, then a large number of
           minor GCs will be performed. If the size is too high, then only full GCs will be performed, which can
           take a long time to complete. Oracle recommends that you keep the size for the young generation between a
           half and a quarter of the overall heap size.

           The following examples show how to set the initial size of young generation to 256 MB using various
           units:

               -XX:NewSize=256m
               -XX:NewSize=262144k
               -XX:NewSize=268435456

           The -XX:NewSize option is equivalent to -Xmn.

       -XX:ParallelGCThreads=threads
           Sets the number of threads used for parallel garbage collection in the young and old generations. The
           default value depends on the number of CPUs available to the JVM.

           For example, to set the number of threads for parallel GC to 2, specify the following option:

               -XX:ParallelGCThreads=2


       -XX:+ParallelRefProcEnabled
           Enables parallel reference processing. By default, this option is disabled.

       -XX:+PrintAdaptiveSizePolicy
           Enables printing of information about adaptive generation sizing. By default, this option is disabled.

       -XX:+PrintGC
           Enables printing of messages at every GC. By default, this option is disabled.

       -XX:+PrintGCApplicationConcurrentTime
           Enables printing of how much time elapsed since the last pause (for example, a GC pause). By default,
           this option is disabled.

       -XX:+PrintGCApplicationStoppedTime
           Enables printing of how much time the pause (for example, a GC pause) lasted. By default, this option is
           disabled.

       -XX:+PrintGCDateStamps
           Enables printing of a date stamp at every GC. By default, this option is disabled.

       -XX:+PrintGCDetails
           Enables printing of detailed messages at every GC. By default, this option is disabled.

       -XX:+PrintGCTaskTimeStamps
           Enables printing of time stamps for every individual GC worker thread task. By default, this option is
           disabled.

       -XX:+PrintGCTimeStamps
           Enables printing of time stamps at every GC. By default, this option is disabled.

       -XX:+PrintStringDeduplicationStatistics
           Prints detailed deduplication statistics. By default, this option is disabled. See the
           -XX:+UseStringDeduplication option.

       -XX:+PrintTenuringDistribution
           Enables printing of tenuring age information. The following is an example of the output:

               Desired survivor size 48286924 bytes, new threshold 10 (max 10)
               - age 1: 28992024 bytes, 28992024 total
               - age 2: 1366864 bytes, 30358888 total
               - age 3: 1425912 bytes, 31784800 total
               ...

           Age 1 objects are the youngest survivors (they were created after the previous scavenge, survived the
           latest scavenge, and moved from eden to survivor space). Age 2 objects have survived two scavenges
           (during the second scavenge they were copied from one survivor space to the next). And so on.

           In the preceding example, 28 992 024 bytes survived one scavenge and were copied from eden to survivor
           space, 1 366 864 bytes are occupied by age 2 objects, etc. The third value in each row is the cumulative
           size of objects of age n or less.

           By default, this option is disabled.

       -XX:+ScavengeBeforeFullGC
           Enables GC of the young generation before each full GC. This option is enabled by default. Oracle
           recommends that you do not disable it, because scavenging the young generation before a full GC can
           reduce the number of objects reachable from the old generation space into the young generation space. To
           disable GC of the young generation before each full GC, specify -XX:-ScavengeBeforeFullGC.

       -XX:SoftRefLRUPolicyMSPerMB=time
           Sets the amount of time (in milliseconds) a softly reachable object is kept active on the heap after the
           last time it was referenced. The default value is one second of lifetime per free megabyte in the heap.
           The -XX:SoftRefLRUPolicyMSPerMB option accepts integer values representing milliseconds per one megabyte
           of the current heap size (for Java HotSpot Client VM) or the maximum possible heap size (for Java HotSpot
           Server VM). This difference means that the Client VM tends to flush soft references rather than grow the
           heap, whereas the Server VM tends to grow the heap rather than flush soft references. In the latter case,
           the value of the -Xmx option has a significant effect on how quickly soft references are garbage
           collected.

           The following example shows how to set the value to 2.5 seconds:

               -XX:SoftRefLRUPolicyMSPerMB=2500


       -XX:StringDeduplicationAgeThreshold=threshold
           String objects reaching the specified age are considered candidates for deduplication. An object's age is
           a measure of how many times it has survived garbage collection. This is sometimes referred to as
           tenuring; see the -XX:+PrintTenuringDistribution option. Note that String objects that are promoted to an
           old heap region before this age has been reached are always considered candidates for deduplication. The
           default value for this option is 3. See the -XX:+UseStringDeduplication option.

       -XX:SurvivorRatio=ratio
           Sets the ratio between eden space size and survivor space size. By default, this option is set to 8. The
           following example shows how to set the eden/survivor space ratio to 4:

               -XX:SurvivorRatio=4


       -XX:TargetSurvivorRatio=percent
           Sets the desired percentage of survivor space (0 to 100) used after young garbage collection. By default,
           this option is set to 50%.

           The following example shows how to set the target survivor space ratio to 30%:

               -XX:TargetSurvivorRatio=30


       -XX:TLABSize=size
           Sets the initial size (in bytes) of a thread-local allocation buffer (TLAB). Append the letter k or K to
           indicate kilobytes, m or M to indicate megabytes, g or G to indicate gigabytes. If this option is set to
           0, then the JVM chooses the initial size automatically.

           The following example shows how to set the initial TLAB size to 512 KB:

               -XX:TLABSize=512k


       -XX:+UseAdaptiveSizePolicy
           Enables the use of adaptive generation sizing. This option is enabled by default. To disable adaptive
           generation sizing, specify -XX:-UseAdaptiveSizePolicy and set the size of the memory allocation pool
           explicitly (see the -XX:SurvivorRatio option).

       -XX:+UseCMSInitiatingOccupancyOnly
           Enables the use of the occupancy value as the only criterion for initiating the CMS collector. By
           default, this option is disabled and other criteria may be used.

       -XX:+UseConcMarkSweepGC
           Enables the use of the CMS garbage collector for the old generation. Oracle recommends that you use the
           CMS garbage collector when application latency requirements cannot be met by the throughput
           (-XX:+UseParallelGC) garbage collector. The G1 garbage collector (-XX:+UseG1GC) is another alternative.

           By default, this option is disabled and the collector is chosen automatically based on the configuration
           of the machine and type of the JVM. When this option is enabled, the -XX:+UseParNewGC option is
           automatically set and you should not disable it, because the following combination of options has been
           deprecated in JDK 8: -XX:+UseConcMarkSweepGC -XX:-UseParNewGC.

       -XX:+UseG1GC
           Enables the use of the garbage-first (G1) garbage collector. It is a server-style garbage collector,
           targeted for multiprocessor machines with a large amount of RAM. It meets GC pause time goals with high
           probability, while maintaining good throughput. The G1 collector is recommended for applications
           requiring large heaps (sizes of around 6 GB or larger) with limited GC latency requirements (stable and
           predictable pause time below 0.5 seconds).

           By default, this option is disabled and the collector is chosen automatically based on the configuration
           of the machine and type of the JVM.

       -XX:+UseGCOverheadLimit
           Enables the use of a policy that limits the proportion of time spent by the JVM on GC before an
           OutOfMemoryError exception is thrown. This option is enabled, by default and the parallel GC will throw
           an OutOfMemoryError if more than 98% of the total time is spent on garbage collection and less than 2% of
           the heap is recovered. When the heap is small, this feature can be used to prevent applications from
           running for long periods of time with little or no progress. To disable this option, specify
           -XX:-UseGCOverheadLimit.

       -XX:+UseNUMA
           Enables performance optimization of an application on a machine with nonuniform memory architecture
           (NUMA) by increasing the application's use of lower latency memory. By default, this option is disabled
           and no optimization for NUMA is made. The option is only available when the parallel garbage collector is
           used (-XX:+UseParallelGC).

       -XX:+UseParallelGC
           Enables the use of the parallel scavenge garbage collector (also known as the throughput collector) to
           improve the performance of your application by leveraging multiple processors.

           By default, this option is disabled and the collector is chosen automatically based on the configuration
           of the machine and type of the JVM. If it is enabled, then the -XX:+UseParallelOldGC option is
           automatically enabled, unless you explicitly disable it.

       -XX:+UseParallelOldGC
           Enables the use of the parallel garbage collector for full GCs. By default, this option is disabled.
           Enabling it automatically enables the -XX:+UseParallelGC option.

       -XX:+UseParNewGC
           Enables the use of parallel threads for collection in the young generation. By default, this option is
           disabled. It is automatically enabled when you set the -XX:+UseConcMarkSweepGC option. Using the
           -XX:+UseParNewGC option without the -XX:+UseConcMarkSweepGC option was deprecated in JDK 8.

       -XX:+UseSerialGC
           Enables the use of the serial garbage collector. This is generally the best choice for small and simple
           applications that do not require any special functionality from garbage collection. By default, this
           option is disabled and the collector is chosen automatically based on the configuration of the machine
           and type of the JVM.

       -XX:+UseSHM
           On Linux, enables the JVM to use shared memory to setup large pages.

           For more information, see "Large Pages".

       -XX:+UseStringDeduplication
           Enables string deduplication. By default, this option is disabled. To use this option, you must enable
           the garbage-first (G1) garbage collector. See the -XX:+UseG1GC option.

           String deduplication reduces the memory footprint of String objects on the Java heap by taking advantage
           of the fact that many String objects are identical. Instead of each String object pointing to its own
           character array, identical String objects can point to and share the same character array.

       -XX:+UseTLAB
           Enables the use of thread-local allocation blocks (TLABs) in the young generation space. This option is
           enabled by default. To disable the use of TLABs, specify -XX:-UseTLAB.

   Deprecated and Removed Options
       These options were included in the previous release, but have since been considered unnecessary.

       -Xincgc
           Enables incremental garbage collection. This option was deprecated in JDK 8 with no replacement.

       -Xrunlibname
           Loads the specified debugging/profiling library. This option was superseded by the -agentlib option.

       -XX:CMSIncrementalDutyCycle=percent
           Sets the percentage of time (0 to 100) between minor collections that the concurrent collector is allowed
           to run. This option was deprecated in JDK 8 with no replacement, following the deprecation of the
           -XX:+CMSIncrementalMode option.

       -XX:CMSIncrementalDutyCycleMin=percent
           Sets the percentage of time (0 to 100) between minor collections that is the lower bound for the duty
           cycle when -XX:+CMSIncrementalPacing is enabled. This option was deprecated in JDK 8 with no replacement,
           following the deprecation of the -XX:+CMSIncrementalMode option.

       -XX:+CMSIncrementalMode
           Enables the incremental mode for the CMS collector. This option was deprecated in JDK 8 with no
           replacement, along with other options that start with CMSIncremental.

       -XX:CMSIncrementalOffset=percent
           Sets the percentage of time (0 to 100) by which the incremental mode duty cycle is shifted to the right
           within the period between minor collections. This option was deprecated in JDK 8 with no replacement,
           following the deprecation of the -XX:+CMSIncrementalMode option.

       -XX:+CMSIncrementalPacing
           Enables automatic adjustment of the incremental mode duty cycle based on statistics collected while the
           JVM is running. This option was deprecated in JDK 8 with no replacement, following the deprecation of the
           -XX:+CMSIncrementalMode option.

       -XX:CMSIncrementalSafetyFactor=percent
           Sets the percentage of time (0 to 100) used to add conservatism when computing the duty cycle. This
           option was deprecated in JDK 8 with no replacement, following the deprecation of the
           -XX:+CMSIncrementalMode option.

       -XX:CMSInitiatingPermOccupancyFraction=percent
           Sets the percentage of the permanent generation occupancy (0 to 100) at which to start a GC. This option
           was deprecated in JDK 8 with no replacement.

       -XX:MaxPermSize=size
           Sets the maximum permanent generation space size (in bytes). This option was deprecated in JDK 8, and
           superseded by the -XX:MaxMetaspaceSize option.

       -XX:PermSize=size
           Sets the space (in bytes) allocated to the permanent generation that triggers a garbage collection if it
           is exceeded. This option was deprecated un JDK 8, and superseded by the -XX:MetaspaceSize option.

       -XX:+UseSplitVerifier
           Enables splitting of the verification process. By default, this option was enabled in the previous
           releases, and verification was split into two phases: type referencing (performed by the compiler) and
           type checking (performed by the JVM runtime). This option was deprecated in JDK 8, and verification is
           now split by default without a way to disable it.

       -XX:+UseStringCache
           Enables caching of commonly allocated strings. This option was removed from JDK 8 with no replacement.

PERFORMANCE TUNING EXAMPLES
       The following examples show how to use experimental tuning flags to either optimize throughput or to provide
       lower response time.

       Example 1 Tuning for Higher Throughput

               java -d64 -server -XX:+AggressiveOpts -XX:+UseLargePages -Xmn10g  -Xms26g -Xmx26g


       Example 2 Tuning for Lower Response Time

               java -d64 -XX:+UseG1GC -Xms26g Xmx26g -XX:MaxGCPauseMillis=500 -XX:+PrintGCTimeStamp


LARGE PAGES
       Also known as huge pages, large pages are memory pages that are significantly larger than the standard memory
       page size (which varies depending on the processor and operating system). Large pages optimize processor
       Translation-Lookaside Buffers.

       A Translation-Lookaside Buffer (TLB) is a page translation cache that holds the most-recently used
       virtual-to-physical address translations. TLB is a scarce system resource. A TLB miss can be costly as the
       processor must then read from the hierarchical page table, which may require multiple memory accesses. By
       using a larger memory page size, a single TLB entry can represent a larger memory range. There will be less
       pressure on TLB, and memory-intensive applications may have better performance.

       However, large pages page memory can negatively affect system performance. For example, when a large mount of
       memory is pinned by an application, it may create a shortage of regular memory and cause excessive paging in
       other applications and slow down the entire system. Also, a system that has been up for a long time could
       produce excessive fragmentation, which could make it impossible to reserve enough large page memory. When
       this happens, either the OS or JVM reverts to using regular pages.

   Large Pages Support
       Solaris and Linux support large pages.

       Solaris
           Solaris 9 and later include Multiple Page Size Support (MPSS); no additional configuration is necessary.
           See
           http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/server-storage/solaris10/overview/solaris9-features-scalability-135663.html.

       Linux
           The 2.6 kernel supports large pages. Some vendors have backported the code to their 2.4-based releases.
           To check if your system can support large page memory, try the following:

               # cat /proc/meminfo | grep Huge
               HugePages_Total: 0
               HugePages_Free: 0
               Hugepagesize: 2048 kB


           If the output shows the three "Huge" variables, then your system can support large page memory but it
           needs to be configured. If the command prints nothing, then your system does not support large pages. To
           configure the system to use large page memory, login as root, and then follow these steps:

            1. If you are using the option -XX:+UseSHM (instead of -XX:+UseHugeTLBFS), then increase the SHMMAX
               value. It must be larger than the Java heap size. On a system with 4 GB of physical RAM (or less),
               the following will make all the memory sharable:

                   # echo 4294967295 > /proc/sys/kernel/shmmax


            2. If you are using the option -XX:+UseSHM or -XX:+UseHugeTLBFS, then specify the number of large pages.
               In the following example, 3 GB of a 4 GB system are reserved for large pages (assuming a large page
               size of 2048kB, then 3 GB = 3 * 1024 MB = 3072 MB = 3072 * 1024 kB = 3145728 kB and 3145728 kB / 2048
               kB = 1536):

                   # echo 1536 > /proc/sys/vm/nr_hugepages

APPLICATION CLASS DATA SHARING
       Application Class Data Sharing (AppCDS) extends CDS (see
       https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/technotes/guides/vm/class-data-sharing.html) to enable classes from the
       standard extensions directories (specified by the system property java.ext.dirs; see
       https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/technotes/guides/extensions/spec.html) and the application class path
       (see "Setting the Class Path ") to be placed in the shared archive. AppCDS reduces the footprint and
       decreases start-up time of your applications provided that a substantial number of classes are loaded from
       the application class path.

       This is a commercial feature that requires you to also specify the -XX:+UnlockCommercialFeatures option. This
       is also an experimental feature; it may change in future releases.

   Creating a Shared Archive File, and Running an Application with It
       The following steps create a shared archive file that contains all the classes used by the test.Hello
       application. The last step runs the application with the shared archive file.

        1. Create a list of all classes used by the test.Hello application. The following command creates a file
           named hello.classlist that contains a list of all classes used by this application:

           java -Xshare:off -XX:+UnlockCommercialFeatures -XX:DumpLoadedClassList=hello.classlist -XX:+UseAppCDS -cp
           hello.jar test.Hello

           Note that the -cp parameter must contain only JAR files; the -XX:+UseAppCDS option does not support class
           paths that contain directory names.

        2. Create a shared archive, named hello.jsa, that contains all the classes in hello.classlist:

           java -XX:+UnlockCommercialFeatures -Xshare:dump -XX:+UseAppCDS -XX:SharedArchiveFile=hello.jsa
           -XX:SharedClassListFile=hello.classlist -cp hello.jar

           Note that the -cp parameter used at archive creation time must be the same as (or a prefix of) the -cp
           used at run time.

        3. Run the application test.Hello with the shared archive hello.jsa:

           java -XX:+UnlockCommercialFeatures -Xshare:on -XX:+UseAppCDS -XX:SharedArchiveFile=hello.jsa -cp
           hello.jar test.Hello

           Ensure that you have specified the option -Xshare:on or -Xshare:auto.

        4. Verify that the test.Hello application is using the class contained in the hello.jsa shared archive:

           java -XX:+UnlockCommercialFeatures -Xshare:on -XX:+UseAppCDS -XX:SharedArchiveFile=hello.jsa -cp
           hello.jar -verbose:class test.Hello

           The output of this command should contain the following text:

           Loaded test.Hello from shared objects file by sun/misc/Launcher$AppClassLoader

   Sharing a Shared Archive across Multiple Application Processes
       You can share the same archive file across multiple applications processes that have the exact same class
       path or share a common class path prefix. This reduces memory usage as the archive is memory-mapped into the
       address space of the processes. The operating system automatically shares the read-only pages across these
       processes.

       The following steps create a shared archive that both applications Hello and Hi can use.

        1. Create a list of all classes used by the Hello application and another list for the Hi application:

           java -XX:+UnlockCommercialFeatures -XX:DumpLoadedClassList=hello.classlist -XX:+UseAppCDS -cp
           common.jar:hello.jar Hello

           java -XX:+UnlockCommercialFeatures -XX:DumpLoadedClassList=hi.classlist -XX:+UseAppCDS -cp
           common.jar:hi.jar Hi

           Note that because the Hello and Hi applications share a common class path prefix (both of their class
           paths start with common.jar), these two applications can share a shared archive file.

        2. Create a single list of classes used by all the applications that will share the shared archive file.

           The following commands combine the files hello.classlist and hi.classlist to one file, common.classlist:

           cat hello.classlist hi.classlist > common.classlist

        3. Create a shared archive, named common.jsa, that contains all the classes in common.classlist:

           java -XX:+UnlockCommercialFeatures -Xshare:dump -XX:SharedArchiveFile=common.jsa -XX:+UseAppCDS
           -XX:SharedClassListFile=common.classlist -cp common.jar

           The value of the -cp parameter is the common class path prefix shared by the Hello and Hi applications.

        4. Run the Hello and Hi applications with the same shared archive:

           java -XX:+UnlockCommercialFeatures -Xshare:on -XX:SharedArchiveFile=common.jsa -XX:+UseAppCDS -cp
           common.jar:hello.jar Hello

           java -XX:+UnlockCommercialFeatures -Xshare:on -XX:SharedArchiveFile=common.jsa -XX:+UseAppCDS -cp
           common.jar:hi.jar Hi

EXIT STATUS
       The following exit values are typically returned by the launcher when the launcher is called with the wrong
       arguments, serious errors, or exceptions thrown by the JVM. However, a Java application may choose to return
       any value by using the API call System.exit(exitValue). The values are:

       ·   0: Successful completion

       ·   >0: An error occurred
