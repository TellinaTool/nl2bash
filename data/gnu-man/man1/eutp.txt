SHELL EXPANSIONS
       Beware  of  special  chars:  * and . are often expanded by your shell, hence sending files * will probably do
       what you want, putting every file existing in the current directory onto the terminal, but  receiving files *
       may  not do what you want: it will only get every file which already exist in the current directory, skipping
       those you just created on your terminal !  If you want to get every file which exist  in  the  terminal,  you
       should use '*' or something similar (please read your shell manual).

       The same warning applies to other special chars, such as $, ~, &,... which should be protected by surrounding
       arguments by quotes (') or by using single backslashes (\) just before them (please read your shell manual).
