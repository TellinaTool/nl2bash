NAME
       glib-genmarshal - C code marshaller generation utility for GLib closures

SYNOPSIS
       glib-genmarshal [OPTION...] [FILE...]

DESCRIPTION
       glib-genmarshal is a small utility that generates C code marshallers for callback functions of the GClosure
       mechanism in the GObject sublibrary of GLib. The marshaller functions have a standard signature, they get
       passed in the invoking closure, an array of value structures holding the callback function parameters and a
       value structure for the return value of the callback. The marshaller is then responsible to call the
       respective C code function of the closure with all the parameters on the stack and to collect its return
       value.

       glib-genmarshal takes a list of marshallers to generate as input. The marshaller list is either read from
       standard input or from files passed as additional arguments on the command line.

   Marshaller list format
       The marshaller lists are processed line by line, a line can contain a comment in the form of

           # this is a comment

       or a marshaller specification of the form

           RTYPE:PTYPE
           RTYPE:PTYPE,PTYPE
           RTYPE:PTYPE,PTYPE,PTYPE

       (up to 16 PTYPEs may be present).

       The RTYPE part specifies the callback's return type and the PTYPEs right to the colon specify the callback's
       parameter list, except for the first and the last arguments which are always pointers.

   Parameter types
       Currently, the following types are supported:

       VOID
           indicates no return type, or no extra parameters. If VOID is used as the parameter list, no additional
           parameters may be present.

       BOOLEAN
           for boolean types (gboolean)

       CHAR
           for signed char types (gchar)

       UCHAR
           for unsigned char types (guchar)

       INT
           for signed integer types (gint)

       UINT
           for unsigned integer types (guint)

       LONG
           for signed long integer types (glong)

       ULONG
           for unsigned long integer types (gulong)

       INT64
           for signed 64bit integer types (gint64)

       UINT64
           for unsigned 64bit integer types (guint64)

       ENUM
           for enumeration types (gint)

       FLAGS
           for flag enumeration types (guint)

       FLOAT
           for single-precision float types (gfloat)

       DOUBLE
           for double-precision float types (gdouble)

       STRING
           for string types (gchar*)

       BOXED
           for boxed (anonymous but reference counted) types (GBoxed*)

       PARAM
           for GParamSpec or derived types (GParamSpec*)

       POINTER
           for anonymous pointer types (gpointer)

       OBJECT
           for GObject or derived types (GObject*)

       VARIANT
           for GVariant types (GVariant*)

       NONE
           deprecated alias for VOID

       BOOL
           deprecated alias for BOOLEAN

OPTIONS
       --header
           Generate header file contents of the marshallers.

       --body
           Generate C code file contents of the marshallers.

       --prefix=PREFIX
           Specify marshaller prefix. The default prefix is `g_cclosure_marshal'.

       --skip-source
           Skip source location remarks in generated comments.

       --stdinc
           Use the standard marshallers of the GObject library, and include gmarshal.h in generated header files.

       --nostdinc
           Do not use the standard marshallers of the GObject library, and skip gmarshal.h include directive in
           generated header files.

       --internal
           Mark generated functions as internal, using G_GNUC_INTERNAL.

       --valist-marshallers
           Generate valist marshallers, for use with g_signal_set_va_marshaller().

       -v, --version
           Print version information.

       --g-fatal-warnings
           Make warnings fatal, that is, exit immediately once a warning occurs.

       -h, --help
           Print brief help and exit.

       -v, --version
           Print version and exit.

EXAMPLE
       To generate marshallers for the following callback functions:

           void   foo (gpointer data1,
                       gpointer data2);
           void   bar (gpointer data1,
                       gint     param1,
                       gpointer data2);
           gfloat baz (gpointer data1,
                       gboolean param1,
                       guchar   param2,
                       gpointer data2);

       The marshaller.list file has to look like this:

           VOID:VOID
           VOID:INT
           FLOAT:BOOLEAN,UCHAR

       and you call glib-genmarshal like this:

           glib-genmarshal --header marshaller.list > marshaller.h
           glib-genmarshal --body marshaller.list > marshaller.c

       The generated marshallers have the arguments encoded in their function name. For this particular list, they
       are

           g_cclosure_user_marshal_VOID__VOID(),
           g_cclosure_user_marshal_VOID__INT(),
           g_cclosure_user_marshal_FLOAT__BOOLEAN_UCHAR().

       They can be used directly for GClosures or be passed in as the GSignalCMarshaller c_marshaller; argument upon
       creation of signals:

           GClosure *cc_foo, *cc_bar, *cc_baz;

           cc_foo = g_cclosure_new (NULL, foo, NULL);
           g_closure_set_marshal (cc_foo, g_cclosure_user_marshal_VOID__VOID);
           cc_bar = g_cclosure_new (NULL, bar, NULL);
           g_closure_set_marshal (cc_bar, g_cclosure_user_marshal_VOID__INT);
           cc_baz = g_cclosure_new (NULL, baz, NULL);
           g_closure_set_marshal (cc_baz, g_cclosure_user_marshal_FLOAT__BOOLEAN_UCHAR);
