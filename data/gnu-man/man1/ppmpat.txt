NAME
       ppmpat - make a pretty pixmap

SYNOPSIS
       ppmpat -gingham2|-g2|-gingham3| -g3|-madras|-tartan| -poles|-squig|-camo| -anticamo width height

DESCRIPTION
       Produces a portable pixmap of the specified width and height, with a pattern in it.

       This  program  is  mainly  to demonstrate use of the ppmdraw routines, a simple but powerful drawing library.
       See the ppmdraw.h include file for more info on using these routines.  Still, some of  the  patterns  can  be
       rather  pretty.   If you have a color workstation, something like ppmpat -squig 300 300 | ppmquant 128 should
       generate a nice background.

OPTIONS
       The different flags specify various different pattern types:

       -gingham2
              A gingham check pattern.  Can be tiled.

       -gingham3
              A slightly more complicated gingham.  Can be tiled.

       -madras
              A madras plaid.  Can be tiled.

       -tartan
              A tartan plaid.  Can be tiled.

       -poles Color gradients centered on randomly-placed poles.  May need to be run through ppmquant.

       -squig Squiggley tubular pattern.  Can be tiled.  May need to be run through ppmquant.

       -camo  Camouflage pattern.  May need to be run through ppmquant.

       -anticamo
              Anti-camouflage pattern - like -camo, but ultra-bright colors.  May need to be run through ppmquant.

       All flags can be abbreviated to their shortest unique prefix.
