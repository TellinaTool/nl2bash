NAME
       qmake - cross-platform makefile generator for Qt


SYNOPSIS
       qmake [mode] [options] [files]

DESCRIPTION
       QMake has two modes, one mode for generating project files based on some heuristics, and the other for gener‐
       ating makefiles. Normally you shouldn't need to specify a mode, as makefile generation is  the  default  mode
       for qmake, but you may use this to test qmake on an existing project.


MODE
       -project
              Put qmake into project file generation mode. In this mode qmake interprets files as files to be built,
              defaults to *.c; *.ui; *.y; *.l; *.ts; *.xlf; *.qrc; *.h; *.hpp; *.hh; *.hxx; *.H; *.cpp; *.cc; *.cxx;
              *.C.

       -makefile
              Put  qmake  into  makefile  generation  mode (default). In this mode qmake interprets files as project
              files to be processed, if skipped qmake will try to find a project file in your current working direc‐
              tory.
