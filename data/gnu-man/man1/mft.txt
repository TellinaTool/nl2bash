MFT(1)                                         General Commands Manual                                        MFT(1)



NAME
       mft - translate Metafont or MetaPost code to TeX code for prettyprinting

SYNOPSIS
       mft [OPTIONS] mf_file_name[.mf|.mp]

DESCRIPTION
       This  manual  page  is not meant to be exhaustive.  The complete documentation for this version of TeX can be
       found in the info file or manual Web2C: A TeX implementation.

       The mft program creates a TeX file from a Metafont or MetaPost program.  It takes appropriate care  of  typo‐
       graphic  details  like page layout and the use of indentation, italics, boldface, etc., as illustrated in the
       book Computer Modern Typefaces.  Special conventions in Metafont and MetaPost comments allow you  to  control
       things  that  would  not  otherwise  come  out right; section 1 of the MFT source program in the Metafontware
       report explains these rules.

       The mft program uses an optional change file (which works just as the change files to tangle(1) and  weave(1)
       do)  and  one or several style files (which are prepended to everything).  If no style file is specified, the
       style file plain.mft for Metafont (or mplain.mft for MetaPost) is automatically used.

       The mf_file_name, optional change_file_name, and style_file_name files are searched for  using  the  MFINPUTS
       (for  Metafont)  or MPINPUTS (for MetaPost) and MFTINPUTS environment variables if you have set them, or else
       the corresponding system defaults.

       The output TeX file name is formed by using .tex in place of the extension of mf_file_name.

OPTIONS
       -change=change_file_name[.ch]
              Apply the change file change_file_name to mf_file_name.

       -metapost
              Assume mf_file_name is a MetaPost source file (this is the default if mf_file_name has  the  extension
              .mp).

       -style=style_file_name[.mft]
              Use  the style file style_file_name insted of plain.mft (or mplain.mft); this option can be given more
              than once.

FILES
       mftmac.tex
              TeX macros used by mft output.

       plain.mft, mplain.mft
              Default style files.

       cmbase.mft
              Style file for Computer Modern.

AUTHORS
       Donald  E. Knuth wrote the program, and he ported it to Unix with the help of Pierre MacKay and the Unix port
       of weave by Howard Trickey and Pavel Curtis.  The program is published in the Metafontware technical  report,
       available from the TeX Users Group.
