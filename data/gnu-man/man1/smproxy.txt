NAME
       smproxy - Session Manager Proxy

SYNOPSIS
       smproxy [-clientId id] [-restore saveFile]

OPTIONS
       -clientId id
               Specifies the session ID used by smproxy in the previous session.

       -restore saveFile
               Specifies the file used by smproxy to save state in the previous session.

DESCRIPTION
       smproxy  allows  X  applications that do not support X11R6 session management to participate in an X11R6 ses‐
       sion.

       In order for smproxy to act as a proxy for an X application, one of the following must be true:

       - The application maps a top level window containing the WM_CLIENT_LEADER property.  This property provides a
       pointer  to  the client leader window which contains the WM_CLASS, WM_NAME, WM_COMMAND, and WM_CLIENT_MACHINE
       properties.

       or ...

       - The application maps a top level window which does not contain  the  WM_CLIENT_LEADER  property.   However,
       this top level window contains the WM_CLASS, WM_NAME, WM_COMMAND, and WM_CLIENT_MACHINE properties.

       An application that support the WM_SAVE_YOURSELF protocol will receive a WM_SAVE_YOURSELF client message each
       time the session manager issues a checkpoint or shutdown.  This allows the application to save state.  If  an
       application does not support the WM_SAVE_YOURSELF protocol, then the proxy will provide enough information to
       the session manager to restart the application (using WM_COMMAND), but no state will be restored.
