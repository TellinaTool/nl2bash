NAME
       ucfq - query the ucf database

SYNOPSIS
        usage: ucfq [options] (/path/to/file|package)[/path/to/file|package  ...]

OPTIONS
       --help h Print out a usage message.
       --debug -d Turn on debugging mode.
       --verbose -v Make the script more verbose..
       --with-colons -w
            Normally, the script presents the information in a human readable tabular format, but that may be harder
            for a machine to parse. With this option, the output is a compact, colon separated line, with no
            dividers, headers, or footer.

       --state-dr dir
            Set the state directory to "/path/to/dir" instead of the default "/var/lib/ucf".  Used mostly for test‐
            ing.

DESCRIPTION
       This script takes a set of arguments, each of which is a package name (and thus does not contain a /) or a
       full path to a configuration file, and outputs the associated package, if any, if the file exists on disk,
       and whether it has been modified by the user.  The output is either a human readable tabular form, or a com‐
       pact colon-separated machine friendly format.

       This script can potentially be used in package "postrm" scripts during purge to query the system for configu‐
       ration files that may still exist on the system, and whether these files have been locally modified by the
       user -- assuming that the package registered all the configuration files with ucf using "ucfr".

CAVEATS
       This is very inchoate, at the moment, and needs testing.

BUGS
       None Known so far.
