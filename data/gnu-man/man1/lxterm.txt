NAME
       lxterm - locale-sensitive wrapper for xterm

SYNOPSIS
       lxterm [ xterm-options ]

DESCRIPTION
       lxterm  is a wrapper around the xterm(1) program that invokes xterm, koi8rxterm(1), or uxterm(1) as appropri‐
       ate, based on the user's locale setting.  All arguments to lxterm are passed to xterm without processing; the
       -class, -k8, and -u8 options should not be specified because they are used by koi8rxterm and uxterm.  See the
       xterm manual page for more information on xterm-options.

       The locale(1) utility is used to determine the character set used by the current locale.   If  the  character
       set  is  UTF-8,  uxterm  is invoked; if the character set is KOI8-R, koi8rxtem is invoked; otherwise, ‘plain’
       xterm is invoked.
