NAME
       arecord, aplay - command-line sound recorder and player for ALSA soundcard driver

SYNOPSIS
       arecord [flags] [filename]
       aplay [flags] [filename [filename]] ...


DESCRIPTION
       arecord  is a command-line soundfile recorder for the ALSA soundcard driver. It supports several file formats
       and multiple soundcards with multiple devices. If recording with interleaved mode samples the file  is  auto‐
       matically split before the 2GB filesize.

       aplay  is  much  the  same, only it plays instead of recording. For supported soundfile formats, the sampling
       rate, bit depth, and so forth can be automatically determined from the soundfile header.

       If filename is not specified, the standard output or input is used. The aplay utility accepts multiple  file‐
       names.


OPTIONS
       -h, --help
              Help: show syntax.

       --version
              Print current version.

       -q --quiet
              Quiet mode. Suppress messages (not sound :))

       -t, --file-type TYPE
              File type (voc, wav, raw or au).  If this parameter is omitted the WAVE format is used.

       -c, --channels=#
              The number of channels.  The default is one channel.  Valid values are 1 through 32.

       -f --format=FORMAT
              Sample format
              Recognized  sample  formats  are: S8 U8 S16_LE S16_BE U16_LE U16_BE S24_LE S24_BE U24_LE U24_BE S32_LE
              S32_BE U32_LE U32_BE FLOAT_LE FLOAT_BE  FLOAT64_LE  FLOAT64_BE  IEC958_SUBFRAME_LE  IEC958_SUBFRAME_BE
              MU_LAW  A_LAW  IMA_ADPCM  MPEG  GSM  SPECIAL  S24_3LE  S24_3BE U24_3LE U24_3BE S20_3LE S20_3BE U20_3LE
              U20_3BE S18_3LE S18_3BE U18_3LE
              Some of these may not be available on selected hardware
              The available format shortcuts are:
              -f cd (16 bit little endian, 44100, stereo) [-f S16_LE -c2 -r44100]
              -f cdr (16 bit big endian, 44100, stereo) [-f S16_BE -c2 -f44100]
              -f dat (16 bit little endian, 48000, stereo) [-f S16_LE -c2 -r48000]
              If no format is given U8 is used.

       -r, --rate=#<Hz>
              Sampling rate in Hertz. The default rate is 8000 Hertz.  If the value specified is less than  300,  it
              is taken as the rate in kilohertz.  Valid values are 2000 through 192000 Hertz.

       -d, --duration=#
              Interrupt after # seconds.  A value of zero means infinity.  The default is zero, so if this option is
              omitted then the arecord process will run until it is killed.

       -s, --sleep-min=#
              Min ticks to sleep. The default is not to sleep.

       -M, --mmap
              Use memory-mapped (mmap) I/O mode for the audio stream.  If this option is not set, the read/write I/O
              mode will be used.

       -N, --nonblock
              Open  the  audio device in non-blocking mode. If the device is busy the program will exit immediately.
              If this option is not set the program will block until the audio device is available again.

       -F, --period-time=#
              Distance between interrupts is # microseconds.  If no period time and no period size is given  then  a
              quarter of the buffer time is set.

       -B, --buffer-time=#
              Buffer  duration  is  #  microseconds  If  no buffer time and no buffer size is given then the maximal
              allowed buffer time but not more than 500ms is set.

       --period-size=#
              Distance between interrupts is # frames If no period size and no period time is given then  a  quarter
              of the buffer size is set.

       --buffer-size=#
              Buffer  duration  is  #  frames If no buffer time and no buffer size is given then the maximal allowed
              buffer time but not more than 500ms is set.

       -A, --avail-min=#
              Min available space for wakeup is # microseconds

       -R, --start-delay=#
              Delay for automatic PCM start is # microseconds (relative to buffer size if <= 0)

       -T, --stop-delay=#
              Delay for automatic PCM stop is # microseconds from xrun

       -v, --verbose
              Show PCM structure and setup.  This option is accumulative.  The VU meter is displayed  when  this  is
              given twice or three times.

       -V, --vumeter=TYPE
              Specifies the VU-meter type, either stereo or mono.  The stereo VU-meter is available only for 2-chan‐
              nel stereo samples with interleaved format.

       -I, --separate-channels
              One file for each channel.  This option disables max-file-time and use-strftime, and ignores  SIGUSR1.
              The stereo VU meter is not available with separate channels.

       -P     Playback.  This is the default if the program is invoked by typing aplay.

       -C     Record.  This is the default if the program is invoked by typing arecord.

       -i, --interactive
              Allow  interactive  operation via stdin.  Currently only pause/resume via space or enter key is imple‐
              mented.

       -m, --chmap=ch1,ch2,...
              Give the channel map to override or follow.  Pass channel position strings like FL, FR, etc.

              If a device supports the override of the channel map, aplay tries to pass the given channel  map.   If
              it  doesn't  support the channel map override but still it provides the channel map information, aplay
              tries to rearrange the channel order in the buffer to match with the returned  channel  map  from  the
              device.

       --disable-resample
              Disable automatic rate resample.

       --disable-channels
              Disable automatic channel conversions.

       --disable-format
              Disable automatic format conversions.

       --disable-softvol
              Disable software volume control (softvol).

       --test-position
              Test ring buffer position.

       --test-coef=<coef>
              Test  coefficient  for ring buffer position; default is 8.  Expression for validation is: coef * (buf‐
              fer_size / 2).  Minimum value is 1.

       --test-nowait
              Do not wait for the ring buffer ‐ eats the whole CPU.

       --max-file-time
              While recording, when the output file has been accumulating sound for this long, close it and  open  a
              new output file.  Default is the maximum size supported by the file format: 2 GiB for WAV files.  This
              option has no effect if  --separate-channels is specified.

       --process-id-file <file name>
              aplay writes its process ID here, so other programs can send signals to it.

       --use-strftime
              When recording, interpret %-codes in the file name parameter using the strftime facility whenever  the
              output  file  is  opened.   The  important strftime codes are: %Y is the year, %m month, %d day of the
              month, %H hour, %M minute and %S second.  In addition, %v is the file number,  starting  at  1.   When
              this  option  is  specified,  intermediate  directories for the output file are created automatically.
              This option has no effect if --separate-channels is specified.

       --dump-hw-params
              Dump hw_params of the device preconfigured status to  stderr.  The  dump  lists  capabilities  of  the
              selected  device  such  as  supported  formats, sampling rates, numbers of channels, period and buffer
              bytes/sizes/times.  For raw device hw:X this option  basically  lists  hardware  capabilities  of  the
              soundcard.

       --fatal-errors
              Disables  recovery  attempts when errors (e.g. xrun) are encountered; the aplay process instead aborts
              immediately.


SIGNALS
       When recording, SIGINT, SIGTERM and SIGABRT will close the output file and exit.  SIGUSR1 will close the out‐
       put file, open a new one, and continue recording.  However, SIGUSR1 does not work with --separate-channels.


EXAMPLES
       aplay -c 1 -t raw -r 22050 -f mu_law foobar
              will play the raw file "foobar" as a 22050-Hz, mono, 8-bit, Mu-Law .au file.


       arecord -d 10 -f cd -t wav -D copy foobar.wav
              will  record  foobar.wav  as  a  10-second, CD-quality wave file, using the PCM "copy" (which might be
              defined in the user's .asoundrc file as:
              pcm.copy {
                type plug
                slave {
                  pcm hw
                }
                route_policy copy
              }


       arecord -t wav --max-file-time 30 mon.wav
              Record from the default audio source in monaural, 8,000 samples per second, 8 bits per sample.   Start
              a  new  file every 30 seconds.  File names are mon-nn.wav, where nn increases from 01.  The file after
              mon-99.wav is mon-100.wav.


       arecord -f cd -t wav --max-file-time 3600 --use-strftime %Y/%m/%d/listen-%H-%M-%v.wav
              Record in stereo from the default audio source.  Create a new file every hour.  The files  are  placed
              in directories based on their start dates and have names which include their start times and file num‐
              bers.
