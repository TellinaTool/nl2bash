NAME
       paperconf - print paper configuration information

SYNOPSIS
       paperconf [ [ -p ] paper | -d | -a ] [ -z ] [ -n | -N ] [ -s | -w | -h ] [ -c | -m | -i ]

DESCRIPTION
       paperconf  prints  information  about a given paper.  The information that can be obtained is the name of the
       paper, its size and its width or height.  When called without arguments, paperconf prints  the  name  of  the
       system-  or  user-specified paper, obtained by looking in order at the PAPERSIZE environment variable, at the
       contents of the file specified by the PAPERCONF environment variable, at the contents of /etc/papersize or by
       using  letter  as  a fall-back value if none of the other alternatives are successful.  By default, width and
       height of the paper are printed in PostScript points.

OPTIONS
       -p paper
              Specify the name of the paper about which information is asked.

       -d     Use the default builtin paper name.

       -a     Consider all known paper names.

       -z     If the paper name is unknown, print it but issue a message on the standard error and exit with a  non-
              zero code.

       -n     Print the name of the paper.

       -N     Print the name of the paper with the first letter capitalized.
