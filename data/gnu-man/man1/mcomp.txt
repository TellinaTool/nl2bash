NAME
       mcomp - Compares two files using mtools

SYNOPSIS
       mcomp file-on-floppy local-file

DESCRIPTION
       mcomp  compares two files, the first one must be on a floppy disk so it can be accesed via mtools.  It is not
       strictly necessary on Debian GNU/Linux, because the diffutils cmp(1) program  provides  the  same  capability
       after copying the file locally with

       mcopy file destination

       but this utility is provided in the mtools package for other platforms and is retained here for completeness.
