              tion marks around the DEB_LINE since it normally contains spaces: ´deb http://ftp.de.debian.org/debian
              unstable main´

       --sources-file SOURCES_FILE
              Specify an alternative sources file to which the new repository should be written. SOURCES_FILE should
              be only the basename: backports.list

       --list-trusted-vendors
              Show all trusted software vendors and theirs keys.

       --hide-terminal
              Do not attach to the interactive terminal of the underlying dpkg call.

       --allow-unauthenticated
              Allow to install packages which are not from a trusted vendor.

EXAMPLES
       The following command will install the package xterm and remove the package eterm in the same run:
              $ aptdcon --install "xterm" --remove "eterm"

       To handle more than one package the names have to be put into quotation marks.  The  following  command  will
       install xterm and eterm:
              $ aptdcon --install "xterm eterm"

       The   following   command  will  add  the  backport  repository  to  the  sources.list  in  a  separate  file
       /etc/apt/sources.list.d/backports.list :
              $ aptdcon --sources-file backports.list \
                  --add-repostiry "deb http://archive.backports.org/debian stable main"

DIAGNOSTICS
       By default aptdaemon logs to the syslog facility AptDaemon. Furthermore you can use  the  -d  option  to  get
       additional information on the command line.
