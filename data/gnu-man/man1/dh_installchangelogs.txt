NAME
       dh_installchangelogs - install changelogs into package build directories

SYNOPSIS
       dh_installchangelogs [debhelper options] [-k] [-Xitem] [upstream]

DESCRIPTION
       dh_installchangelogs is a debhelper program that is responsible for installing changelogs into package build
       directories.

       An upstream changelog file may be specified as an option.

       If there is an upstream changelog file, it will be be installed as usr/share/doc/package/changelog in the
       package build directory.

       If the upstream changelog is is a html file (determined by file extension), it will be installed as
       usr/share/doc/package/changelog.html instead. If the html changelog is converted to plain text, that variant
       can be specified as a second upstream changelog file. When no plain text variant is specified, a short
       usr/share/doc/package/changelog is generated, pointing readers at the html changelog file.

FILES
       debian/changelog
       debian/NEWS
       debian/package.changelog
       debian/package.NEWS
           Automatically installed into usr/share/doc/package/ in the package build directory.

           Use the package specific name if package needs a different NEWS or changelog file.

           The changelog file is installed with a name of changelog for native packages, and changelog.Debian for
           non-native packages.  The NEWS file is always installed with a name of NEWS.Debian.

OPTIONS
       -k, --keep
           Keep the original name of the upstream changelog. This will be accomplished by installing the upstream
           changelog as changelog, and making a symlink from that to the original name of the changelog file. This
           can be useful if the upstream changelog has an unusual name, or if other documentation in the package
           refers to the changelog file.

       -Xitem, --exclude=item
           Exclude upstream changelog files that contain item anywhere in their filename from being installed.

       upstream
           Install this file as the upstream changelog.
