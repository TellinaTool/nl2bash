MSCOMPRESS(1)                                  General Commands Manual                                 MSCOMPRESS(1)



NAME
       mscompress - compress data using LZ77 algorithm

SYNOPSIS
       mscompress [ -h ]
       mscompress [ -V ]
       mscompress [ name ...  ]

DESCRIPTION
       Mscompress  reduces  the  size  of the named files using Lempel-Ziv coding (LZ77).  Each input file  is compressed to
       file eding with underscore and original file remains untouched. Output files then can be decompressed using Microsoft
       EXPAND.EXE utility or msexpand(1). In other words, mscompress(1) is binary compatible with Microsoft's COMPRESS.EXE


BUGS
       Mscompress cannot compress standard input as gzip(1) or compress(1) do.
