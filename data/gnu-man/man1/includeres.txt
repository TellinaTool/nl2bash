NAME
       includeres - filter to include resources in a PostScript document

SYNOPSIS
       includeres < document.ps > output.ps

DESCRIPTION
       Includeres  includes resources (fonts, procsets, patterns, files, etc) in place of %%IncludeResource comments
       in a PostScript document. The resources are searched for in the current  directory  and  the  system  default
       directory under the resource name, and with an appropriate extension.  The pipeline

                                          extractres file.ps | includeres >out.ps

       will move all resources appearing in a document to the document prologue, removing redundant copies. The out‐
       put file can then be put through page re-arrangement filters such as psnup or pstops safely.

FILES
       /usr/lib/psutils - system resource directory.
