NAME
       Enchant - a spellchecker

SYNOPSIS
       enchant [-a] [-d dict] [-h] [-l] [-L] [-v]

DESCRIPTION
       Enchant is an ispell-compatible spellchecker.

   OPTIONS
       -a     List suggestions in ispell pipe mode format.

       -d dict
              Use dictionary <dict>.

       -h     Show short help.

       -l     List only the misspellings.

       -L     Include the line number in the output.

       -v     Prints the program's version.

ENCHANT ORDERING FILE
       Enchant  has  a  global  and a per-user ordering file named enchant.ordering.  It lets the user specify which
       spelling backend to use for individual languages in the case when you  care  which  backend  gets  used.  The
       global  file  is  located in $(datadir)/enchant and the per-user file is located in ~/.enchant.  The per-user
       file takes precedence, if found.

       The ordering file takes the form language_tag:<comma-separated list of spelling  backends>.  I  am  currently
       aware  of  the following backends: aspell, myspell, ispell, uspell, hspell, voikko, and zemberek. '*' is used
       to mean "use this ordering for all languages, unless instructed otherwise." For example:

       *:aspell,myspell,ispell
       en:aspell,myspell,ispell
       en_UK:myspell,aspell,ispell
       fr:myspell,ispell:aspell

DIRECTORIES IMPORTANT TO ENCHANT
       Unless configured otherwise, Enchant's Myspell, Ispell, and Uspell backends will  look  for  dictionaries  in
       directories  specific to Enchant, and will not use your system-wide installed dictionaries. This is for prag‐
       matic reasons since many distributions install these dictionaries into different locations.

       Like the enchant.ordering file described above, Enchant looks in the global directory for these  dictionaries
       and a per-user directory.  The per-user directory takes precedence if it is found.  Enchant looks for Myspell
       dictionaries in $(datadir)/enchant/myspell and ~/.enchant/myspell.  Enchant looks for Ispell dictionaries  in
       $(datadir)/enchant/ispell    and    ~/.enchant/ispell.     Enchant   looks   for   Uspell   dictionaries   in
       $(datadir)/enchant/uspell and ~/.enchant/uspell.

       Packagers and users may wish to make symbolic links to the system-wide dictionary  directories.  Or,  prefer‐
       ably, use the --with-myspell-dir, --with-ispell-dir, and --with-uspell-dir 'configure' arguments.
