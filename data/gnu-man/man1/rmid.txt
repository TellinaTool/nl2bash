rmid(1)                                 Remote Method Invocation (RMI) Tools                                 rmid(1)



NAME
       rmid - Starts the activation system daemon that enables objects to be registered and activated in a Java
       Virtual Machine (JVM).

SYNOPSIS
       rmid [options]


       options
              The command-line options. See Options.

DESCRIPTION
       The rmid command starts the activation system daemon. The activation system daemon must be started before
       activatable objects can be either registered with the activation system or activated in a JVM. For details on
       how to write programs that use activatable objects, the Using Activation tutorial at
       http://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/technotes/guides/rmi/activation/overview.html

       Start the daemon by executing the rmid command and specifying a security policy file, as follows:

       rmid -J-Djava.security.policy=rmid.policy

       When you run Oracle’s implementation of the rmid command, by default you must specify a security policy file
       so that the rmid command can verify whether or not the information in each ActivationGroupDesc is allowed to
       be used to start a JVM for an activation group. Specifically, the command and options specified by the
       CommandEnvironment and any properties passed to an ActivationGroupDesc constructor must now be explicitly
       allowed in the security policy file for the rmid command. The value of the sun.rmi.activation.execPolicy
       property dictates the policy that the rmid command uses to determine whether or not the information in an
       ActivationGroupDesc can be used to start a JVM for an activation group. For more information see the
       description of the -J-Dsun.rmi.activation.execPolicy=policy option.

       Executing the rmid command starts the Activator and an internal registry on the default port1098 and binds an
       ActivationSystem to the name java.rmi.activation.ActivationSystem in this internal registry.

       To specify an alternate port for the registry, you must specify the -port option when you execute the rmid
       command. For example, the following command starts the activation system daemon and a registry on the
       registry's default port, 1099.

       rmid -J-Djava.security.policy=rmid.policy -port 1099


START RMID ON DEMAND
       An alternative to starting rmid from the command line is to configure inetd (Oracle Solaris) or xinetd
       (Linux) to start rmid on demand.

       When RMID starts, it attempts to obtain an inherited channel (inherited from inetd/xinetd) by calling the
       System.inheritedChannel method. If the inherited channel is null or not an instance of
       java.nio.channels.ServerSocketChannel, then RMID assumes that it was not started by inetd/xinetd, and it
       starts as previously described.

       If the inherited channel is a ServerSocketChannel instance, then RMID uses the java.net.ServerSocket obtained
       from the ServerSocketChannel as the server socket that accepts requests for the remote objects it exports:
       The registry in which the java.rmi.activation.ActivationSystem is bound and the java.rmi.activation.Activator
       remote object. In this mode, RMID behaves the same as when it is started from the command line, except in the
       following cases:

       · Output printed to System.err is redirected to a file. This file is located in the directory specified by
         the java.io.tmpdir system property (typically /var/tmp or /tmp) with the prefix rmid-err and the suffix
         tmp.

       · The -port option is not allowed. If this option is specified, then RMID exits with an error message.

       · The -log option is required. If this option is not specified, then RMID exits with an error message

       See the man pages for inetd (Oracle Solaris) or xinetd (Linux) for details on how to configure services to be
       started on demand.

OPTIONS
       -Coption
              Specifies an option that is passed as a command-line argument to each child process (activation group)
              of the rmid command when that process is created. For example, you could pass a property to each
              virtual machine spawned by the activation system daemon:

              rmid -C-Dsome.property=value



              This ability to pass command-line arguments to child processes can be useful for debugging. For
              example, the following command enables server-call logging in all child JVMs.

              rmid -C-Djava.rmi.server.logCalls=true



       -Joption
              Specifies an option that is passed to the Java interpreter running RMID. For example, to specify that
              the rmid command use a policy file named rmid.policy, the -J option can be used to define the
              java.security.policy property on the rmid command line, for example:

              rmid -J-Djava.security.policy-rmid.policy



       -J-Dsun.rmi.activation.execPolicy=policy
              Specifies the policy that RMID employs to check commands and command-line options used to start the
              JVM in which an activation group runs. Please note that this option exists only in Oracle's
              implementation of the Java RMI activation daemon. If this property is not specified on the command
              line, then the result is the same as though -J-Dsun.rmi.activation.execPolicy=default were specified.
              The possible values of policy can be default, policyClassName, or none.

              · default

                The default or unspecified value execPolicy allows the rmid command to execute commands with
                specific command-line options only when the rmid command was granted permission to execute those
                commands and options in the security policy file that the rmid command uses. Only the default
                activation group implementation can be used with the default execution policy.

                The rmid command starts a JVM for an activation group with the information in the group's registered
                activation group descriptor, an ActivationGroupDesc. The group descriptor specifies an optional
                ActivationGroupDesc.CommandEnvironment that includes the command to execute to start the activation
                group and any command-line options to be added to the command line. By default, the rmid command
                uses the java command found in java.home. The group descriptor also contains properties overrides
                that are added to the command line as options defined as: -D<property>=<value>.The
                com.sun.rmi.rmid.ExecPermission permission grants the rmid command permission to execute a command
                that is specified in the group descriptor's CommandEnvironment to start an activation group. The
                com.sun.rmi.rmid.ExecOptionPermission permission enables the rmid command to use command-line
                options, specified as properties overrides in the group descriptor or as options in the
                CommandEnvironment when starting the activation group.When granting the rmid command permission to
                execute various commands and options, the permissions ExecPermission and ExecOptionPermission must
                be granted to all code sources.

                ExecPermission

                The ExecPermission class represents permission for the rmid command to execute a specific command to
                start an activation group.

                Syntax: The name of an ExecPermission is the path name of a command to grant the rmid command
                permission to execute. A path name that ends in a slash (/) and an asterisk (*) indicates that all
                of the files contained in that directory where slash is the file-separator character,
                File.separatorChar. A path name that ends in a slash (/) and a minus sign (-) indicates all files
                and subdirectories contained in that directory (recursively). A path name that consists of the
                special token <<ALL FILES>> matches any file.

                A path name that consists of an asterisk (*) indicates all the files in the current directory. A
                path name that consists of a minus sign (-) indicates all the files in the current directory and
                (recursively) all files and subdirectories contained in the current directory.

                ExecOptionPermission

                The ExecOptionPermission class represents permission for the rmid command to use a specific command-
                line option when starting an activation group. The name of an ExecOptionPermission is the value of a
                command-line option.

                Syntax: Options support a limited wild card scheme. An asterisk signifies a wild card match, and it
                can appear as the option name itself (matches any option), or an asterisk (*) can appear at the end
                of the option name only when the asterisk (*) follows a dot (.) or an equals sign (=).

                For example: * or -Dmydir.* or -Da.b.c=* is valid, but *mydir or -Da*b or ab* is not.

                Policy file for rmid

                When you grant the rmid command permission to execute various commands and options, the permissions
                ExecPermission and ExecOptionPermission must be granted to all code sources (universally). It is
                safe to grant these permissions universally because only the rmid command checks these permissions.

                An example policy file that grants various execute permissions to the rmid command is:

                grant {
                    permission com.sun.rmi.rmid.ExecPermission
                        "/files/apps/java/jdk1.7.0/solaris/bin/java";
                    permission com.sun.rmi.rmid.ExecPermission
                        "/files/apps/rmidcmds/*";
                    permission com.sun.rmi.rmid.ExecOptionPermission
                        "-Djava.security.policy=/files/policies/group.policy";
                    permission com.sun.rmi.rmid.ExecOptionPermission
                        "-Djava.security.debug=*";
                    permission com.sun.rmi.rmid.ExecOptionPermission
                        "-Dsun.rmi.*";
                };



                The first permission granted allows the rmid tcommand o execute the 1.7.0 release of the java
                command, specified by its explicit path name. By default, the version of the java command found in
                java.home is used (the same one that the rmid command uses), and does not need to be specified in
                the policy file. The second permission allows the rmid command to execute any command in the
                directory /files/apps/rmidcmds.

                The third permission granted, an ExecOptionPermission, allows the rmid command to start an
                activation group that defines the security policy file to be /files/policies/group.policy. The next
                permission allows the java.security.debug property to be used by an activation group. The last
                permission allows any property in the sun.rmi property name hierarchy to be used by activation
                groups.

                To start the rmid command with a policy file, the java.security.policy property needs to be
                specified on the rmid command line, for example:

                rmid -J-Djava.security.policy=rmid.policy.

              · <policyClassName>

                If the default behavior is not flexible enough, then an administrator can provide, when starting the
                rmid command, the name of a class whose checkExecCommand method is executed to check commands to be
                executed by the rmid command.

                The policyClassName specifies a public class with a public, no-argument constructor and an
                implementation of the following checkExecCommand method:

                 public void checkExecCommand(ActivationGroupDesc desc, String[] command)
                        throws SecurityException;



                Before starting an activation group, the rmid command calls the policy's checkExecCommand method and
                passes to it the activation group descriptor and an array that contains the complete command to
                start the activation group. If the checkExecCommand throws a SecurityException, then the rmid
                command does not start the activation group and an ActivationException is thrown to the caller
                attempting to activate the object.

              · none

                If the sun.rmi.activation.execPolicy property value is none, then the rmid command does not perform
                any validation of commands to start activation groups.


       -log dir
              Specifies the name of the directory the activation system daemon uses to write its database and
              associated information. The log directory defaults to creating a log, in the directory in which the
              rmid command was executed.

       -port port
              Specifies the port the registry uses. The activation system daemon binds the ActivationSystem, with
              the name java.rmi.activation.ActivationSystem, in this registry. The ActivationSystem on the local
              machine can be obtained using the following Naming.lookup method call:

              import java.rmi.*;
                  import java.rmi.activation.*;
                  ActivationSystem system; system = (ActivationSystem)
                  Naming.lookup("//:port/java.rmi.activation.ActivationSystem");



       -stop
              Stops the current invocation of the rmid command for a port specified by the -port option. If no port
              is specified, then this option stops the rmid invocation running on port 1098.

ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES
       CLASSPATH
              Used to provide the system a path to user-defined classes. Directories are separated by colons, for
              example: .:/usr/local/java/classes.
