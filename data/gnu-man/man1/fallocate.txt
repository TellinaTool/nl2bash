NAME
       fallocate - preallocate space to a file

SYNOPSIS
       fallocate [-n] [-o offset] -l length filename

DESCRIPTION
       fallocate  is used to preallocate blocks to a file.  For filesystems which support the fallocate system call,
       this is done quickly by allocating blocks and marking them as uninitialized, requiring  no  IO  to  the  data
       blocks.  This is much faster than creating a file by filling it with zeros.

       As  of  the  Linux  Kernel v2.6.31, the fallocate system call is supported by the btrfs, ext4, ocfs2, and xfs
       filesystems.

       The exit code returned by fallocate is 0 on success and 1 on failure.

OPTIONS
       The length and offset arguments may be followed by binary (2^N) suffixes KiB, MiB, GiB, TiB, PiB and EiB (the
       "iB" is optional, e.g. "K" has the same meaning as "KiB") or decimal (10^N) suffixes KB, MB, GB, PB and EB.

       -h, --help
              Print help and exit.

       -n, --keep-size
              Do  not  modify  the apparent length of the file. This may effectively allocate blocks past EOF, which
              can be removed with a truncate.

       -o, --offset offset
              Specifies the beginning offset of the allocation, in bytes.

       -l, --length length
              Specifies the length of the allocation, in bytes.
