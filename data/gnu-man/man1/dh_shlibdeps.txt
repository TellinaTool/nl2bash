NAME
       dh_shlibdeps - calculate shared library dependencies

SYNOPSIS
       dh_shlibdeps [debhelper options] [-Lpackage] [-ldirectory] [-Xitem] [-- params]

DESCRIPTION
       dh_shlibdeps is a debhelper program that is responsible for calculating shared library dependencies for
       packages.

       This program is merely a wrapper around dpkg-shlibdeps(1) that calls it once for each package listed in the
       control file, passing it a list of ELF executables and shared libraries it has found.

OPTIONS
       -Xitem, --exclude=item
           Exclude files that contain item anywhere in their filename from being passed to dpkg-shlibdeps. This will
           make their dependencies be ignored.  This may be useful in some situations, but use it with caution. This
           option may be used more than once to exclude more than one thing.

       -- params
           Pass params to dpkg-shlibdeps(1).

       -uparams, --dpkg-shlibdeps-params=params
           This is another way to pass params to dpkg-shlibdeps(1).  It is deprecated; use -- instead.

       -ldirectory[:directory ...]
           With recent versions of dpkg-shlibdeps, this option is generally not needed.

           It tells dpkg-shlibdeps (via its -l parameter), to look for private package libraries in the specified
           directory (or directories -- separate with colons). With recent versions of dpkg-shlibdeps, this is
           mostly only useful for packages that build multiple flavors of the same library, or other situations
           where the library is installed into a directory not on the regular library search path.

       -Lpackage, --libpackage=package
           With recent versions of dpkg-shlibdeps, this option is generally not needed, unless your package builds
           multiple flavors of the same library.

           It tells dpkg-shlibdeps (via its -S parameter) to look first in the package build directory for the
           specified package, when searching for libraries, symbol files, and shlibs files.

EXAMPLES
       Suppose that your source package produces libfoo1, libfoo-dev, and libfoo-bin binary packages. libfoo-bin
       links against libfoo1, and should depend on it. In your rules file, first run dh_makeshlibs, then
       dh_shlibdeps:

               dh_makeshlibs
               dh_shlibdeps

       This will have the effect of generating automatically a shlibs file for libfoo1, and using that file and the
       libfoo1 library in the debian/libfoo1/usr/lib directory to calculate shared library dependency information.

       If a libbar1 package is also produced, that is an alternate build of libfoo, and is installed into
       /usr/lib/bar/, you can make libfoo-bin depend on libbar1 as follows:

               dh_shlibdeps -Llibbar1 -l/usr/lib/bar
