NAME
       du - estimate file space usage

SYNOPSIS
       du [OPTION]... [FILE]...
       du [OPTION]... --files0-from=F

DESCRIPTION
       Summarize disk usage of each FILE, recursively for directories.

       Mandatory arguments to long options are mandatory for short options too.

       -0, --null
              end each output line with 0 byte rather than newline

       -a, --all
              write counts for all files, not just directories

       --apparent-size
              print apparent sizes, rather than disk usage; although the apparent size is usually smaller, it may be
              larger due to holes in ('sparse') files, internal fragmentation, indirect blocks, and the like

       -B, --block-size=SIZE
              scale sizes by SIZE before printing them.  E.g., '-BM' prints sizes in units of 1,048,576 bytes.   See
              SIZE format below.

       -b, --bytes
              equivalent to '--apparent-size --block-size=1'

       -c, --total
              produce a grand total

       -D, --dereference-args
              dereference only symlinks that are listed on the command line

       -d, --max-depth=N
              print  the  total for a directory (or file, with --all) only if it is N or fewer levels below the com‐
              mand line argument;  --max-depth=0 is the same as --summarize

       --files0-from=F
              summarize disk usage of the NUL-terminated file names specified in file F; If F is - then  read  names
              from standard input

       -H     equivalent to --dereference-args (-D)

       -h, --human-readable
              print sizes in human readable format (e.g., 1K 234M 2G)

       -k     like --block-size=1K

       -L, --dereference
              dereference all symbolic links

       -l, --count-links
              count sizes many times if hard linked

       -m     like --block-size=1M

       -P, --no-dereference
              don't follow any symbolic links (this is the default)

       -S, --separate-dirs
              do not include size of subdirectories

       --si   like -h, but use powers of 1000 not 1024

       -s, --summarize
              display only a total for each argument

       -t, --threshold=SIZE
              exclude entries smaller than SIZE if positive, or entries greater than SIZE if negative

       --time show time of the last modification of any file in the directory, or any of its subdirectories

       --time=WORD
              show time as WORD instead of modification time: atime, access, use, ctime or status

       --time-style=STYLE
              show times using style STYLE: full-iso, long-iso, iso, +FORMAT FORMAT is interpreted like 'date'

       -X, --exclude-from=FILE
              exclude files that match any pattern in FILE

       --exclude=PATTERN
              exclude files that match PATTERN

       -x, --one-file-system
              skip directories on different file systems

       --help display this help and exit

       --version
              output version information and exit

       Display  values are in units of the first available SIZE from --block-size, and the DU_BLOCK_SIZE, BLOCK_SIZE
       and BLOCKSIZE environment variables.  Otherwise, units default to 1024 bytes (or 512  if  POSIXLY_CORRECT  is
       set).

       SIZE  is an integer and optional unit (example: 10M is 10*1024*1024).  Units are K, M, G, T, P, E, Z, Y (pow‐
       ers of 1024) or KB, MB, ... (powers of 1000).

PATTERNS
       PATTERN is a shell pattern (not a regular expression).  The pattern ?  matches any one character,  whereas  *
       matches  any  string  (composed  of zero, one or multiple characters).  For example, *.o will match any files
       whose names end in .o.  Therefore, the command

              du --exclude='*.o'

       will skip all files and subdirectories ending in .o (including the file .o itself).
