h5c++(1)                                       General Commands Manual                                      h5c++(1)



NAME
       h5c++ - Helper script to compile HDF5 C++ applications.

SYNOPSIS
       h5c++ [OPTIONS] <compile line>

DESCRIPTION
       h5c++  can be used in much the same way MPIch is used to compile an HDF5 program. It takes care of specifying
       where the HDF5 header files and libraries are on the command line.

       h5c++ supercedes all other compiler scripts in that if you've used one set of compiler scripts to compile the
       HDF5  C++  library, then h5c++ uses those same scripts. For example, when compiling an MPIch program, you use
       the mpiCC script.

       Some programs use HDF5 in only a few modules. It isn't necessary to use h5c++ to compile those modules  which
       don't  use  HDF5.  In  fact, since h5c++ is only a convenience script, you are still able to compile HDF5 C++
       modules in the normal way. In that case, you will have to specify the HDF5 libraries and include paths  your‐
       self.

       An  example  of  how  to  use  h5c++ to compile the program hdf_prog, which consists of modules prog1.cpp and
       prog2.cpp and uses the HDF5 C++ library, would be as follows:
               # h5c++ -c prog1.cpp
               # h5c++ -c prog2.cpp
               # h5c++ -o hdf_prog prog1.o prog2.o

       -help  Prints a help message.

       -echo  Show all the shell commands executed.

       -prefix=DIR
              Use the directory DIR to find the HDF5 lib/ and include/ subdirectories.   Default:  prefix  specified
              when configuring HDF5.

       -show  Show the commands without executing them.

       <compile line>
              The  normal  compile  line options for your compiler. h5c++ uses the same compiler you used to compile
              HDF5. Check your compiler's manual for more information on which options are needed.

ENVIRONMENT
       HDF5_CXX
              Use a different C++ compiler.

       HDF5_CXXLINKER
              Use a different linker.
