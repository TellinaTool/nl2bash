NAME
       docker-volume - Manage volumes



SYNOPSIS
       docker volume COMMAND



DESCRIPTION
       The docker volume command has subcommands for managing data volumes. A data volume is a specially-designated
       directory that by-passes storage driver management.


       Data volumes persist data independent of a container's life cycle. When you delete a container, the Docker
       daemon does not delete any data volumes. You can share volumes across multiple containers. Moreover, you can
       share data volumes with other computing resources in your system.


       To see help for a subcommand, use:


              docker volume COMMAND --help



       For full details on using docker volume visit Docker's online documentation.
