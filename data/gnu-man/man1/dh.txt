NAME
       dh - debhelper command sequencer

SYNOPSIS
       dh sequence [--with addon[,addon ...]] [--list] [debhelper options]

DESCRIPTION
       dh runs a sequence of debhelper commands. The supported sequences correspond to the targets of a debian/rules
       file: build-arch, build-indep, build, clean, install-indep, install-arch, install, binary-arch, binary-indep,
       and binary.

OVERRIDE TARGETS
       A debian/rules file using dh can override the command that is run at any step in a sequence, by defining an
       override target.

       To override dh_command, add a target named override_dh_command to the rules file. When it would normally run
       dh_command, dh will instead call that target. The override target can then run the command with additional
       options, or run entirely different commands instead. See examples below.

       Override targets can also be defined to run only when building architecture dependent or architecture
       independent packages.  Use targets with names like override_dh_command-arch and override_dh_command-indep.
       (Note that to use this feature, you should Build-Depend on debhelper 8.9.7 or above.)

OPTIONS
       --with addon[,addon ...]
           Add the debhelper commands specified by the given addon to appropriate places in the sequence of commands
           that is run. This option can be repeated more than once, or multiple addons can be listed, separated by
           commas.  This is used when there is a third-party package that provides debhelper commands. See the
           PROGRAMMING file for documentation about the sequence addon interface.

       --without addon
           The inverse of --with, disables using the given addon. This option can be repeated more than once, or
           multiple addons to disable can be listed, separated by commas.

       --list, -l
           List all available addons.

       --no-act
           Prints commands that would run for a given sequence, but does not run them.

           Note that dh normally skips running commands that it knows will do nothing.  With --no-act, the full list
           of commands in a sequence is printed.

       Other options passed to dh are passed on to each command it runs. This can be used to set an option like -v
       or -X or -N, as well as for more specialised options.

EXAMPLES
       To see what commands are included in a sequence, without actually doing anything:

               dh binary-arch --no-act

       This is a very simple rules file, for packages where the default sequences of commands work with no
       additional options.

               #!/usr/bin/make -f
               %:
                       dh $@

       Often you'll want to pass an option to a specific debhelper command. The easy way to do with is by adding an
       override target for that command.

               #!/usr/bin/make -f
               %:
                       dh $@

               override_dh_strip:
                       dh_strip -Xfoo

               override_dh_auto_configure:
                       dh_auto_configure -- --with-foo --disable-bar

       Sometimes the automated dh_auto_configure(1) and dh_auto_build(1) can't guess what to do for a strange
       package. Here's how to avoid running either and instead run your own commands.

               #!/usr/bin/make -f
               %:
                       dh $@

               override_dh_auto_configure:
                       ./mondoconfig

               override_dh_auto_build:
                       make universe-explode-in-delight

       Another common case is wanting to do something manually before or after a particular debhelper command is
       run.

               #!/usr/bin/make -f
               %:
                       dh $@

               override_dh_fixperms:
                       dh_fixperms
                       chmod 4755 debian/foo/usr/bin/foo

       If your package uses autotools and you want to freshen config.sub and config.guess with newer versions from
       the autotools-dev package at build time, you can use some commands provided in autotools-dev that automate
       it, like this.

               #!/usr/bin/make -f
               %:
                       dh $@ --with autotools_dev

       Python tools are not run by dh by default, due to the continual change in that area. (Before compatibility
       level v9, dh does run dh_pysupport.)  Here is how to use dh_python2.

               #!/usr/bin/make -f
               %:
                       dh $@ --with python2

       Here is how to force use of Perl's Module::Build build system, which can be necessary if debhelper wrongly
       detects that the package uses MakeMaker.

               #!/usr/bin/make -f
               %:
                       dh $@ --buildsystem=perl_build

       Here is an example of overriding where the dh_auto_* commands find the package's source, for a package where
       the source is located in a subdirectory.

               #!/usr/bin/make -f
               %:
                       dh $@ --sourcedirectory=src

       And here is an example of how to tell the dh_auto_* commands to build in a subdirectory, which will be
       removed on clean.

               #!/usr/bin/make -f
               %:
                       dh $@ --builddirectory=build

       If your package can be built in parallel, you can support parallel building as follows. Then dpkg-
       buildpackage -j will work.

               #!/usr/bin/make -f
               %:
                       dh $@ --parallel

       Here is a way to prevent dh from running several commands that you don't want it to run, by defining empty
       override targets for each command.

               #!/usr/bin/make -f
               %:
                       dh $@

               # Commands not to run:
               override_dh_auto_test override_dh_compress override_dh_fixperms:

       A long build process for a separate documentation package can be separated out using architecture independent
       overrides.  These will be skipped when running build-arch and binary-arch sequences.

               #!/usr/bin/make -f
               %:
                       dh $@

               override_dh_auto_build-indep:
                       $(MAKE) -C docs

               # No tests needed for docs
               override_dh_auto_test-indep:

               override_dh_auto_install-indep:
                       $(MAKE) -C docs install

       Adding to the example above, suppose you need to chmod a file, but only when building the architecture
       dependent package, as it's not present when building only documentation.

               override_dh_fixperms-arch:
                       dh_fixperms
                       chmod 4755 debian/foo/usr/bin/foo

INTERNALS
       If you're curious about dh's internals, here's how it works under the hood.

       Each debhelper command will record when it's successfully run in debian/package.debhelper.log. (Which
       dh_clean deletes.) So dh can tell which commands have already been run, for which packages, and skip running
       those commands again.

       Each time dh is run, it examines the log, and finds the last logged command that is in the specified
       sequence. It then continues with the next command in the sequence. The --until, --before, --after, and
       --remaining options can override this behavior.

       A sequence can also run dependent targets in debian/rules.  For example, the "binary" sequence runs the
       "install" target.

       dh uses the DH_INTERNAL_OPTIONS environment variable to pass information through to debhelper commands that
       are run inside override targets. The contents (and indeed, existence) of this environment variable, as the
       name might suggest, is subject to change at any time.

       Commands in the build-indep, install-indep and binary-indep sequences are passed the -i option to ensure they
       only work on architecture independent packages, and commands in the build-arch, install-arch and binary-arch
       sequences are passed the -a option to ensure they only work on architecture dependent packages.

DEPRECATED OPTIONS
       The following options are deprecated. It's much better to use override targets instead.

       --until cmd
           Run commands in the sequence until and including cmd, then stop.

       --before cmd
           Run commands in the sequence before cmd, then stop.

       --after cmd
           Run commands in the sequence that come after cmd.

       --remaining
           Run all commands in the sequence that have yet to be run.

       In the above options, cmd can be a full name of a debhelper command, or a substring. It'll first search for a
       command in the sequence exactly matching the name, to avoid any ambiguity. If there are multiple substring
       matches, the last one in the sequence will be used.
