DESCRIPTION
       pacat is a simple tool for playing back or capturing raw or encoded audio files on a PulseAudio sound server.

OPTIONS
       -h | --help
              Show help.

       --version
              Show version information.

       -r | --record
              Capture  audio  data and write it to the specified file or to STDOUT if none is specified. If the tool
              is called under the name parec this is the default.

       -p | --playback
              Read audio data from the specified file or STDIN if none is specified, and play it back. If  the  tool
              is called under the name pacat this is the default.

       -v | --verbose
              Enable verbose operation. Dumps the current playback time to STDERR during playback/capturing.

       -s | --server=SERVER
              Choose the server to connect to.

       -d | --device=SINKORSOURCE
              Specify the symbolic name of the sink/source to play/record this stream on/from.

       -n | --client-name=NAME
              Specify the client name paplay shall pass to the server when connecting.

       --stream-name=NAME
              Specify the stream name paplay shall pass to the server when creating the stream.

       --volume=VOLUME
              Specify the initial playback volume to use. Choose a value between 0 (silent) and 65536 (100% volume).

       --rate=SAMPLERATE
              Capture or play back audio with the specified sample rate. Defaults to 44100 Hz.

       --format=FORMAT
              Capture  or  play back audio with the specified sample format. Specify one of u8, s16le, s16be, s32le,
              s32be, float32le, float32be, ulaw, alaw, s32le, s32be, s24le, s24be, s24-32le, s24-32be. Depending  on
              the  endianness of the CPU the formats s16ne, s16re, s32ne, s32re, float32ne, float32re, s32ne, s32re,
              s24ne, s24re, s24-32ne, s24-32re (for native, resp. reverse endian) are available as aliases. Defaults
              to s16ne.

       --channels=CHANNELS
              Capture  or  play back audio with the specified number of channels. If more than two channels are used
              it is recommended to use the --channel-map option below. Defaults to 2.

       --channel-map=CHANNELMAP
              Explicitly choose a channel map when playing back this stream. The argument should be  a  comma  sepa‐
              rated list of channel names: front-left, front-right, mono, front-center, rear-left, rear-right, rear-
              center, lfe, front-left-of-center,  front-right-of-center,  side-left,  side-right,  top-center,  top-
              front-center,  top-front-left, top-front-right, top-rear-left, top-rear-right, top-rear-center, or any
              of the 32 auxiliary channel names aux0 to aux31.

       --fix-format
              If passed, the sample format of the stream is changed to the native format of the sink the  stream  is
              connected to.

       --fix-rate
              If  passed,  the  sampling  rate of the stream is changed to the native rate of the sink the stream is
              connected to.

       --fix-channels
              If passed, the number of channels and the channel map of the stream is changed to the native number of
              channels and the native channel map of the sink the stream is connected to.

       --no-remix
              Never upmix or downmix channels.

       --no-remap
              Never  remap  channels. Instead of mapping channels by their name this will match them solely by their
              index/order.

       --latency=BYTES
              Explicitly configure the latency, with a time specified in bytes in the  selected  sample  format.  If
              left  out  the  server  will  pick  the latency, usually relatively high for power saving reasons. Use
              either this option or --latency-msec, but not both.

       --latency-msec=MSEC
              Explicitly configure the latency, with a time specified in milliseconds. If left out the  server  will
              pick  the  latency,  usually  relatively  high  for  power  saving  reasons. Use either this option or
              --latency, but not both.

       --process-time=BYTES
              Explicitly configure the process time, with a time specified in bytes in the selected  sample  format.
              If  left out the server will pick the process time. Use either this option or --process-time-msec, but
              not both.

       --process-time-msec=MSEC
              Explicitly configure the process time, with a time specified in miliseconds. If left  out  the  server
              will pick the process time. Use either this option or --process-time, but not both.

       --property=PROPERTY=VALUE
              Attach a property to the client and stream. May be used multiple times

       --raw  Play/record raw audio data. This is the default if this program is invoked as pacat , parec or pamon

       --file-format[=FFORMAT]
              Play/record  encoded  audio  data in the file format specified. This is the default if this program is
              invoked as paplay and parecord

       --list-file-formats
              List supported file formats.
