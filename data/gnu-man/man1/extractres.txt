EXTRACTRES(1)                                  General Commands Manual                                 EXTRACTRES(1)



NAME
       extractres - filter to extract resources from a PostScript document

SYNOPSIS
       extractres [ -m ] < document.ps > output.ps

DESCRIPTION
       Extractres extracts resources (fonts, procsets, patterns, files, etc) appearing in a PostScript document, and
       puts appropriate %%IncludeResource comments in the document prologue. The extracted resources are written  to
       files with the same name as the resource, and an appropriate extension. The pipeline

                                          extractres file.ps | includeres >out.ps

       will move all resources appearing in a document to the document prologue, removing redundant copies. The out‐
       put file can then be put through page re-arrangement filters such as psnup or pstops safely.

       The -m option combines the resources of the same name into one file; this must  be  used  for  some  programs
       which download fonts a bit at a time.
