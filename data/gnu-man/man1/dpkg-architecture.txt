NAME
       dpkg-architecture - set and determine the architecture for package building

SYNOPSIS
       dpkg-architecture [option...] [command]

DESCRIPTION
       dpkg-architecture  does  provide  a facility to determine and set the build and host architecture for package
       building.

       The build architecture is always determined by an external call to dpkg(1), and can not be set at the command
       line.

       You  can  specify  the  host  architecture  by providing one or both of the options -a and -t. The default is
       determined by an external call to gcc(1), or the same as the build architecture if CC or  gcc  are  both  not
       available.  One  out  of  -a  and  -t  is sufficient, the value of the other will be set to a usable default.
       Indeed, it is often better to only specify one, because dpkg-architecture will warn you if your  choice  does
       not match the default.

COMMANDS
       -l     Print  the  environment  variables,  one  each line, in the format VARIABLE=value. This is the default
              action.

       -edebian-architecture
              Check for equality of architecture (since dpkg 1.13.13). By default  debian-architecture  is  compared
              against  the current Debian architecture, being the host. This action will not expand the architecture
              wildcards.  Command finishes with an exit status of 0 if matched, 1 if not matched.


       -iarchitecture-wildcard
              Check for identity of architecture by expanding architecture-wildcard as an architecture wildcard  and
              comparing against the current Debian architecture (since dpkg 1.13.13).  Command finishes with an exit
              status of 0 if matched, 1 if not matched.

       -qvariable-name
              Print the value of a single variable.

       -s     Print an export command. This can be used to set the environment variables using eval.

       -u     Print a similar command to -s but to unset all variables.

       -c command
              Execute a command in an environment which has all variables set to the determined value.

       -L     Print a list of valid architecture names.

       -?, --help
              Show the usage message and exit.

       --version
              Show the version and exit.

OPTIONS
       -adebian-architecture
              Set the Debian architecture.

       -tgnu-system-type
              Set the GNU system type.

       -f     Values set by existing environment variables with the same name as used by  the  scripts  are  honored
              (i.e.  used by dpkg-architecture), except if this force flag is present. This allows the user to over‐
              ride a value even when the call to dpkg-architecture is buried  in  some  other  script  (for  example
              dpkg-buildpackage(1)).

TERMS
       build machine
           The machine the package is built on.

       host machine
           The machine the package is built for.

       Debian architecture
           The  Debian  architecture  string,  which  specifies  the binary tree in the FTP archive. Examples: i386,
           sparc, hurd-i386.

       architecture wildcard
           An architecture wildcard is a special architecture string that will match  any  real  architecture  being
           part of it. The general form is <kernel>-<cpu>.  Examples: linux-any, any-i386, hurd-any.

       GNU system type
           An architecture specification string consisting of two parts separated by a hyphen: cpu and system. Exam‐
           ples: i386-linux-gnu, sparc-linux-gnu, i386-gnu, x86_64-netbsd.

       DEB_BUILD_ARCH
           The Debian architecture of the build machine.

       DEB_BUILD_ARCH_OS

FILES
   Architecture tables
       All these files have to be present for dpkg-architecture to work. Their location can be overridden at runtime
       with the environment variable DPKG_DATADIR.

       /usr/share/dpkg/cputable
              Table of known CPU names and mapping to their GNU name.

       /usr/share/dpkg/ostable
              Table of known operating system names and mapping to their GNU name.

       /usr/share/dpkg/triplettable
              Mapping between Debian architecture triplets and Debian architecture names.

   Packaging support
       /usr/share/dpkg/architecture.mk
              Makefile  snippet  that  properly  sets  and  exports all the variables that dpkg-architecture outputs
              (since dpkg 1.16.1).

EXAMPLES
       dpkg-buildpackage accepts the -a option and passes it to dpkg-architecture. Other examples:

              CC=i386-gnu-gcc dpkg-architecture -c debian/rules build

              eval `dpkg-architecture -u`

       Check if an architecture is equal to the current architecture or a given one:

              dpkg-architecture -elinux-alpha

              dpkg-architecture -amips -elinux-mips

       Check if the current architecture or an architecture provided with -a are Linux systems:

              dpkg-architecture -ilinux-any

              dpkg-architecture -ai386 -ilinux-any

   Usage in debian/rules
       The environment variables set by dpkg-architecture are passed to debian/rules as  make  variables  (see  make
       documentation).  However,  you  should  not  rely  on  them,  as this breaks manual invocation of the script.
       Instead, you should always initialize them using dpkg-architecture with the -q option. Here  are  some  exam‐
       ples, which also show how you can improve the cross compilation support in your package:

       Retrieving the GNU system type and forwarding it to ./configure:

           DEB_BUILD_GNU_TYPE ?= $(shell dpkg-architecture -qDEB_BUILD_GNU_TYPE)
           DEB_HOST_GNU_TYPE ?= $(shell dpkg-architecture -qDEB_HOST_GNU_TYPE)
           [...]
           ifeq ($(DEB_BUILD_GNU_TYPE), $(DEB_HOST_GNU_TYPE))
             confflags += --build=$(DEB_HOST_GNU_TYPE)
           else
             confflags += --build=$(DEB_BUILD_GNU_TYPE) \
                          --host=$(DEB_HOST_GNU_TYPE)
           endif
           [...]
           ./configure $(confflags)

       Doing something only for a specific architecture:

           DEB_HOST_ARCH ?= $(shell dpkg-architecture -qDEB_HOST_ARCH)

           ifeq ($(DEB_HOST_ARCH),alpha)
             [...]
           endif

       or if you only need to check the CPU or OS type, use the DEB_HOST_ARCH_CPU or DEB_HOST_ARCH_OS variables.

       Note  that  you  can  also  rely  on  an  external  Makefile  snippet  to properly set all the variables that
       dpkg-architecture can provide:

           include /usr/share/dpkg/architecture.mk

           ifeq ($(DEB_HOST_ARCH),alpha)
             [...]
           endif

       In any case, you should never use dpkg --print-architecture to get architecture information during a  package
       build.
