NAME
       afm2afm - reencode an afm file

SYNOPSIS
       afm2afm [-help] [-encoding encodingfile] [-kpx kpxfile] [-output outputfile] afmfile

DESCRIPTION
       afm2afm re-encodes an afm file.

       Metrics (including kerning data) for characters not present in the chosen encoding are excluded from the
       output, which resuls in (potentially much) smaller files.

       Additional kerning pairs can be added to the output file.  If you don't specify an encoding file, the afm
       file isn't re-encoded; however, all unused (unencoded) data is still pruned.

       The program also generates an entry for a dvips-style map file, but only if the afm file has been re-encoded
       and the output was written to file (i.e., if both the -encoding and -output options were specified).

OPTIONS AND ARGUMENTS
       -help
           Print a short description of the syntax

       -encoding encodingfile
           Re-encode to the enconding in encodingfile

       -kpx kpxfile
           Read additional kerning pairs from kpxfile and add these to the output.  This option cannot be used to
           override values from the input afm file, since afm2afm will write both old and new values to the output!

           The kpxfile should contain kerning data in standard afm format, i.e. for each kerning pair there should
           be a line

               KPX <left_glyph> <right_glyph> <amount>

           All other lines in the kpxfile are ignored.

       -output outputfile
           Write the result to outputfile instead of "stdout".

       afmfile
           The afm file to be re-encoded.

       You may use either one or two dashes before options, and option names may be shortened to a unique prefix.

RECENT CHANGES
       (See the source code for the rest of the story.)

       2013-08-07  Added the -kpx command-line option.  Replaced all "given/when" constructions in the source code
                   by "if"'s, to avoid warnings about experimental features in Perl 5.18 and later.

       2012-02-01  Refactored the code; added the "no re-encoding, only pruning" functionality.
