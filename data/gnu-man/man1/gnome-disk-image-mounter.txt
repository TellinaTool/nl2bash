NAME
       gnome-disk-image-mounter - Attach and mount disk images

SYNOPSIS
       gnome-disk-image-mounter [--writable] [URI...]

DESCRIPTION
       gnome-disk-image-mounter can be used to set up disk images. Both regular files and GVfs URIs (such as
       smb://filer/media/file.iso) can be used in the URI parameter. If no URIs are given and a window server is
       running, a graphical file chooser will be presented.

       Note that gnome-disk-image-mounter will not mount filesystems or unlock encrypted volumes in the disk image -
       this responsibility is left to the automounter in GNOME Shell to ensure that the same interactions happen as
       if the disk image was a regular physical device or disc.

       By default the disk images are attached read-only, use the option --writable to change this.

RETURN VALUE
       gnome-disk-image-mounter returns 0 on success and non-zero on failure.
