NAME
       allcm - force the most important Computer-Modern-fonts to be calculated

SYNOPSIS
       allcm [-r]

DESCRIPTION
       allcm  forces  a large number of Computer Modern Fonts to be calculated as pixel files.  This is done through
       running dvips(1) over a certain test-file. Therefore, the fonts are  created  in  the  resolution  needed  by
       dvips.

       If the -r flag is specified, the command dvired(1) will be used instead of dvips.

       allcm does not recalculate existing fonts (as long as the Metafont mode does not change).


SEE ALSO
       allec(1), allneeded(1), dvips(1), dvired(1).
