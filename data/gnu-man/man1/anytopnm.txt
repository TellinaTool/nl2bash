NAME
       anytopnm - attempt to convert an unknown type of image file to a portable anymap


SYNOPSIS
       anytopnm [file]


DESCRIPTION
       anytopnm  converts  the  input  image, which may be in any of dozens of graphics formats, to PBM, PGM, or PPM
       format, depending on that nature of the input image, and outputs it to Standard Output.

       To determine the format of the input, anytopnm uses the file program (possibly assisted by the magic  numbers
       file  fragment  included  with  Netpbm).  If that fails (very few image formats have magic numbers), anytopnm
       looks at the filename extension.  If that fails, anytopnm punts.

       The type of the output file depends on the input image.

       If file indicates that the input file is compressed (either via Unix compress, gzip,  or  bzip  compression),
       anytopnm uncompresses it and proceeds as above with the uncompressed result.

       If  file  indicates  that  the input file is encoded by uuencode or btoa, anytopnm decodes it and proceeds as
       above with the decoded result.

       If file is - or not given, anytopnm takes its input from Standard Input.
