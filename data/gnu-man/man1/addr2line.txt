DESCRIPTION
       addr2line translates addresses into file names and line numbers.  Given an address in an executable or an
       offset in a section of a relocatable object, it uses the debugging information to figure out which file name
       and line number are associated with it.

       The executable or relocatable object to use is specified with the -e option.  The default is the file a.out.
       The section in the relocatable object to use is specified with the -j option.

       addr2line has two modes of operation.

       In the first, hexadecimal addresses are specified on the command line, and addr2line displays the file name
       and line number for each address.

       In the second, addr2line reads hexadecimal addresses from standard input, and prints the file name and line
       number for each address on standard output.  In this mode, addr2line may be used in a pipe to convert
       dynamically chosen addresses.

       The format of the output is FILENAME:LINENO.  The file name and line number for each input address is printed
       on separate lines.

       If the -f option is used, then each FILENAME:LINENO line is preceded by FUNCTIONNAME which is the name of the
       function containing the address.

       If the -i option is used and the code at the given address is present there because of inlining by the
       compiler then the {FUNCTIONNAME} FILENAME:LINENO information for the inlining function will be displayed
       afterwards.  This continues recursively until there is no more inlining to report.

       If the -a option is used then the output is prefixed by the input address.

       If the -p option is used then the output for each input address is displayed on one, possibly quite long,
       line.  If -p is not used then the output is broken up into multiple lines, based on the paragraphs above.

       If the file name or function name can not be determined, addr2line will print two question marks in their
       place.  If the line number can not be determined, addr2line will print 0.

OPTIONS
       The long and short forms of options, shown here as alternatives, are equivalent.

       -a
       --addresses
           Display the address before the function name, file and line number information.  The address is printed
           with a 0x prefix to easily identify it.

       -b bfdname
       --target=bfdname
           Specify that the object-code format for the object files is bfdname.

       -C
       --demangle[=style]
           Decode (demangle) low-level symbol names into user-level names.  Besides removing any initial underscore
           prepended by the system, this makes C++ function names readable.  Different compilers have different
           mangling styles. The optional demangling style argument can be used to choose an appropriate demangling
           style for your compiler.

       -e filename
       --exe=filename
           Specify the name of the executable for which addresses should be translated.  The default file is a.out.

       -f
       --functions
           Display function names as well as file and line number information.

       -s
       --basenames
           Display only the base of each file name.

       -i
       --inlines
           If the address belongs to a function that was inlined, the source information for all enclosing scopes
           back to the first non-inlined function will also be printed.  For example, if "main" inlines "callee1"
           which inlines "callee2", and address is from "callee2", the source information for "callee1" and "main"
           will also be printed.

       -j
       --section
           Read offsets relative to the specified section instead of absolute addresses.

       -p
       --pretty-print
           Make the output more human friendly: each location are printed on one line.  If option -i is specified,
           lines for all enclosing scopes are prefixed with (inlined by).

       @file
           Read command-line options from file.  The options read are inserted in place of the original @file
           option.  If file does not exist, or cannot be read, then the option will be treated literally, and not
           removed.

           Options in file are separated by whitespace.  A whitespace character may be included in an option by
           surrounding the entire option in either single or double quotes.  Any character (including a backslash)
           may be included by prefixing the character to be included with a backslash.  The file may itself contain
           additional @file options; any such options will be processed recursively.
