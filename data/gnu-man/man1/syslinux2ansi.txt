SYSLINUX2ANSI(1)                               General Commands Manual                              SYSLINUX2ANSI(1)



NAME
       syslinux2ansi - converts a syslinux-format screen to pc-ansi

SYNOPSIS
       syslinux2ansi < filename.input > filename.output

DESCRIPTION
       Syslinux2ansi  is a filter which converts a screen formatted for syslinux to one compatible with PC ANSI.  It
       will only read from standard in, and has no command line options.

BUGS
       Help and version command line options would be useful.

       The ability to put input and output filenames on the command line might be good as well.

   Bug reports
       I would appreciate hearing of any problems you have with SYSLINUX.  I would also like to hear from you if you
       have successfully used SYSLINUX, especially if you are using it for a distribution.

       If  you  are reporting problems, please include all possible information about your system and your BIOS; the
       vast majority of all problems reported turn out to be BIOD or hardware bugs, and I need as  much  information
       as possible in order to diagnose the problems.

       There  is  a mailing list for discussion among SYSLINUX users and for announcements of new and test versions.
       To join, send a message to majordomo@linux.kernel.org with the line:

       subscribe syslinux

       in the body of the message.  The submission address is syslinux@linux.kernel.org.
