       -h | --help
                 Display help for this command

       -d | --debug
                 Enable verbose output for debugging

       -r | --report-uri <value>
                 Report the Open MPI contact information for the server. This information is required for  MPI  jobs
                 to  use  the data server. Three parameter values are supported: (a) '-', indicating that the uri is
                 to be printed to stdout; (b) '+', indicating that the uri is to  be  printed  to  stderr;  and  (c)
                 "file:path-to-file",  indicating that the uri is to be printed to the specified file. The "path-to-
                 file" can be either absolute or relative, but must be in a location where the user has  write  per‐
                 missions.  Please  note  that  the  resulting file must be read-accessible to expected users of the
                 server.

DESCRIPTION
