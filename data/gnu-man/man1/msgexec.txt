NAME
       msgexec - process translations of message catalog

SYNOPSIS
       msgexec [OPTION] COMMAND [COMMAND-OPTION]

DESCRIPTION
       Applies  a command to all translations of a translation catalog.  The COMMAND can be any program that reads a
       translation from standard input.  It is invoked once for each translation.  Its output becomes msgexec's out‐
       put.  msgexec's return code is the maximum return code across all invocations.

       A  special  builtin  command  called  '0'  outputs  the  translation, followed by a null byte.  The output of
       "msgexec 0" is suitable as input for "xargs -0".

       Mandatory arguments to long options are mandatory for short options too.

   Input file location:
       -i, --input=INPUTFILE
              input PO file

       -D, --directory=DIRECTORY
              add DIRECTORY to list for input files search

       If no input file is given or if it is -, standard input is read.

   Input file syntax:
       -P, --properties-input
              input file is in Java .properties syntax

       --stringtable-input
              input file is in NeXTstep/GNUstep .strings syntax

   Informative output:
       -h, --help
              display this help and exit

       -V, --version
              output version information and exit
