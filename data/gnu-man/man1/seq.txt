NAME
       seq - print a sequence of numbers

SYNOPSIS
       seq [OPTION]... LAST
       seq [OPTION]... FIRST LAST
       seq [OPTION]... FIRST INCREMENT LAST

DESCRIPTION
       Print numbers from FIRST to LAST, in steps of INCREMENT.

       Mandatory arguments to long options are mandatory for short options too.

       -f, --format=FORMAT
              use printf style floating-point FORMAT

       -s, --separator=STRING
              use STRING to separate numbers (default: \n)

       -w, --equal-width
              equalize width by padding with leading zeroes

       --help display this help and exit

       --version
              output version information and exit

       If  FIRST  or  INCREMENT is omitted, it defaults to 1.  That is, an omitted INCREMENT defaults to 1 even when
       LAST is smaller than FIRST.  FIRST, INCREMENT, and LAST are interpreted as floating point values.   INCREMENT
       is usually positive if FIRST is smaller than LAST, and INCREMENT is usually negative if FIRST is greater than
       LAST.  FORMAT must be suitable for printing one argument of type 'double'; it defaults to %.PRECf  if  FIRST,
       INCREMENT, and LAST are all fixed point decimal numbers with maximum precision PREC, and to %g otherwise.
