NAME
       pgmedge - edge-detect a portable graymap


SYNOPSIS
       pgmedge [pgmfile]


DESCRIPTION
       Reads  a portable graymap as input.  Outlines the edges, and writes a portable graymap as output.  Piping the
       result through pgmtopbm -threshold and playing with the threshold value will give a bitmap of the edges.

       The edge detection technique used is to take the Pythagorean sum  of  two  Sobel  gradient  operators  at  90
       degrees to each other.  For more details see "Digital Image Processing" by Gonzalez and Wintz, chapter 7.

       The  maxval of the output is the same as the maxval of the input The effect is better with larger maxvals, so
       you may want to increase the maxval of the input by running it through pnmdepth first.
