GETTEXT(1)                                               GNU                                              GETTEXT(1)



NAME
       gettext - translate message

SYNOPSIS
       gettext [OPTION] [[TEXTDOMAIN] MSGID]
       gettext [OPTION] -s [MSGID]...

DESCRIPTION
       The  gettext program translates a natural language message into the user's language, by looking up the trans‐
       lation in a message catalog.

       Display native language translation of a textual message.

       -d, --domain=TEXTDOMAIN
              retrieve translated messages from TEXTDOMAIN

       -e     enable expansion of some escape sequences

       -E     (ignored for compatibility)

       -h, --help
              display this help and exit

       -n     suppress trailing newline

       -V, --version
              display version information and exit

       [TEXTDOMAIN] MSGID
              retrieve translated message corresponding to MSGID from TEXTDOMAIN

       If the TEXTDOMAIN parameter is not given, the domain is determined from the environment variable  TEXTDOMAIN.
       If  the  message  catalog  is  not found in the regular directory, another location can be specified with the
       environment variable TEXTDOMAINDIR.  When used with the -s option the program behaves like  the  'echo'  com‐
       mand.   But  it  does  not simply copy its arguments to stdout.  Instead those messages found in the selected
       catalog are translated.  Standard search directory: /usr/share/locale
