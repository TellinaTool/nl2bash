DESCRIPTION
       Reads a portable graymap as input.  Enhances the edges, and writes a portable graymap as output.

       The  edge  enhancing  technique  is taken from Philip R. Thompson's "xim" program, which in turn took it from
       section 6 of "Digital Halftones by Dot Diffusion", D. E. Knuth, ACM Transaction on Graphics Vol.  6,  No.  4,
       October 1987, which in turn got it from two 1976 papers by J. F. Jarvis et. al.

OPTIONS
       The  optional -N flag should be a digit from 1 to 9.  1 is the lowest level of enhancement, 9 is the highest,
       The default is 9.
