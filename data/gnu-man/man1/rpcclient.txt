NAME
       rpcclient - tool for executing client side MS-RPC functions

SYNOPSIS
       rpcclient [-A authfile] [-c <command string>] [-d debuglevel] [-l logdir] [-N] [-s <smb config file>]
        [-U username[%password]] [-W workgroup] [-I destinationIP] {server}

DESCRIPTION
       This tool is part of the samba(7) suite.

       rpcclient is a utility initially developed to test MS-RPC functionality in Samba itself. It has undergone
       several stages of development and stability. Many system administrators have now written scripts around it to
       manage Windows NT clients from their UNIX workstation.

OPTIONS
       server
           NetBIOS name of Server to which to connect. The server can be any SMB/CIFS server. The name is resolved
           using the name resolve order line from smb.conf(5).

       -c|--command=<command string>
           Execute semicolon separated commands (listed below)

       -I|--dest-ip IP-address
           IP address is the address of the server to connect to. It should be specified in standard "a.b.c.d"
           notation.

           Normally the client would attempt to locate a named SMB/CIFS server by looking it up via the NetBIOS name
           resolution mechanism described above in the name resolve order parameter above. Using this parameter will
           force the client to assume that the server is on the machine with the specified IP address and the
           NetBIOS name component of the resource being connected to will be ignored.

           There is no default for this parameter. If not supplied, it will be determined automatically by the
           client as described above.

       -p|--port port
           This number is the TCP port number that will be used when making connections to the server. The standard
           (well-known) TCP port number for an SMB/CIFS server is 139, which is the default.

       -d|--debuglevel=level
           level is an integer from 0 to 10. The default value if this parameter is not specified is 0.

           The higher this value, the more detail will be logged to the log files about the activities of the
           server. At level 0, only critical errors and serious warnings will be logged. Level 1 is a reasonable
           level for day-to-day running - it generates a small amount of information about operations carried out.

           Levels above 1 will generate considerable amounts of log data, and should only be used when investigating
           a problem. Levels above 3 are designed for use only by developers and generate HUGE amounts of log data,
           most of which is extremely cryptic.

           Note that specifying this parameter here will override the log level parameter in the smb.conf file.

       -V|--version
           Prints the program version number.

       -s|--configfile=<configuration file>
           The file specified contains the configuration details required by the server. The information in this
           file includes server-specific information such as what printcap file to use, as well as descriptions of
           all the services that the server is to provide. See smb.conf for more information. The default
           configuration file name is determined at compile time.

       -l|--log-basename=logdirectory
           Base directory name for log/debug files. The extension ".progname" will be appended (e.g. log.smbclient,
           log.smbd, etc...). The log file is never removed by the client.

       --option=<name>=<value>
           Set the smb.conf(5) option "<name>" to value "<value>" from the command line. This overrides compiled-in
           defaults and options read from the configuration file.

       -N|--no-pass
           If specified, this parameter suppresses the normal password prompt from the client to the user. This is
           useful when accessing a service that does not require a password.

           Unless a password is specified on the command line or this parameter is specified, the client will
           request a password.

           If a password is specified on the command line and this option is also defined the password on the
           command line will be silently ingnored and no password will be used.

       -k|--kerberos
           Try to authenticate with kerberos. Only useful in an Active Directory environment.

       -C|--use-ccache
           Try to use the credentials cached by winbind.

       -A|--authentication-file=filename
           This option allows you to specify a file from which to read the username and password used in the
           connection. The format of the file is

               username = <value>
               password = <value>
               domain   = <value>

           Make certain that the permissions on the file restrict access from unwanted users.

       -U|--user=username[%password]
           Sets the SMB username or username and password.

           If %password is not specified, the user will be prompted. The client will first check the USER
           environment variable, then the LOGNAME variable and if either exists, the string is uppercased. If these
           environmental variables are not found, the username GUEST is used.

           A third option is to use a credentials file which contains the plaintext of the username and password.
           This option is mainly provided for scripts where the admin does not wish to pass the credentials on the
           command line or via environment variables. If this method is used, make certain that the permissions on
           the file restrict access from unwanted users. See the -A for more details.

           Be cautious about including passwords in scripts. Also, on many systems the command line of a running
           process may be seen via the ps command. To be safe always allow rpcclient to prompt for a password and
           type it in directly.

       -S|--signing on|off|required
           Set the client signing state.

       -P|--machine-pass
           Use stored machine account password.

       -e|--encrypt
           This command line parameter requires the remote server support the UNIX extensions or that the SMB3
           protocol has been selected. Requests that the connection be encrypted. Negotiates SMB encryption using
           either SMB3 or POSIX extensions via GSSAPI. Uses the given credentials for the encryption negotiation
           (either kerberos or NTLMv1/v2 if given domain/username/password triple. Fails the connection if
           encryption cannot be negotiated.

       --pw-nt-hash
           The supplied password is the NT hash.

       -n|--netbiosname <primary NetBIOS name>
           This option allows you to override the NetBIOS name that Samba uses for itself. This is identical to
           setting the netbios name parameter in the smb.conf file. However, a command line setting will take
           precedence over settings in smb.conf.

       -i|--scope <scope>
           This specifies a NetBIOS scope that nmblookup will use to communicate with when generating NetBIOS names.
           For details on the use of NetBIOS scopes, see rfc1001.txt and rfc1002.txt. NetBIOS scopes are very rarely
           used, only set this parameter if you are the system administrator in charge of all the NetBIOS systems
           you communicate with.

       -W|--workgroup=domain
           Set the SMB domain of the username. This overrides the default domain which is the domain defined in
           smb.conf. If the domain specified is the same as the servers NetBIOS name, it causes the client to log on
           using the servers local SAM (as opposed to the Domain SAM).

       -O|--socket-options socket options
           TCP socket options to set on the client socket. See the socket options parameter in the smb.conf manual
           page for the list of valid options.

       -?|--help
           Print a summary of command line options.

       --usage
           Display brief usage message.

   SPOOLSS
       adddriver <arch> <config> [<version>]
           Execute an AddPrinterDriver() RPC to install the printer driver information on the server. Note that the
           driver files should already exist in the directory returned by getdriverdir. Possible values for arch are
           the same as those for the getdriverdir command. The config parameter is defined as follows:

               Long Driver Name:\
               Driver File Name:\
               Data File Name:\
               Config File Name:\
               Help File Name:\
               Language Monitor Name:\
               Default Data Type:\
               Comma Separated list of Files

           Any empty fields should be enter as the string "NULL".

           Samba does not need to support the concept of Print Monitors since these only apply to local printers
           whose driver can make use of a bi-directional link for communication. This field should be "NULL". On a
           remote NT print server, the Print Monitor for a driver must already be installed prior to adding the
           driver or else the RPC will fail.

           The version parameter lets you specify the printer driver version number. If omitted, the default driver
           version for the specified architecture will be used. This option can be used to upload Windows 2000
           (version 3) printer drivers.

       addprinter <printername> <sharename> <drivername> <port>
           Add a printer on the remote server. This printer will be automatically shared. Be aware that the printer
           driver must already be installed on the server (see adddriver) and the portmust be a valid port name (see
           enumports.

       deldriver <driver>
           Delete the specified printer driver for all architectures. This does not delete the actual driver files
           from the server, only the entry from the server's list of drivers.

       deldriverex <driver> [architecture] [version] [flags]
           Delete the specified printer driver and optionally files associated with the driver. You can limit this
           action to a specific architecture and a specific version. If no architecture is given, all driver files
           of that driver will be deleted.  flags correspond to numeric DPD_* values, i.e. a value of 3 requests
           (DPD_DELETE_UNUSED_FILES | DPD_DELETE_SPECIFIC_VERSION).

       enumdata
           Enumerate all printer setting data stored on the server. On Windows NT clients, these values are stored
           in the registry, while Samba servers store them in the printers TDB. This command corresponds to the MS
           Platform SDK GetPrinterData() function (* This command is currently unimplemented).

       enumdataex
           Enumerate printer data for a key

       enumjobs <printer>
           List the jobs and status of a given printer. This command corresponds to the MS Platform SDK EnumJobs()
           function

       enumkey
           Enumerate printer keys

       enumports [level]
           Executes an EnumPorts() call using the specified info level. Currently only info levels 1 and 2 are
           supported.

       enumdrivers [level]
           Execute an EnumPrinterDrivers() call. This lists the various installed printer drivers for all
           architectures. Refer to the MS Platform SDK documentation for more details of the various flags and
           calling options. Currently supported info levels are 1, 2, and 3.

       enumprinters [level]
           Execute an EnumPrinters() call. This lists the various installed and share printers. Refer to the MS
           Platform SDK documentation for more details of the various flags and calling options. Currently supported
           info levels are 1, 2 and 5.

       getdata <printername> <valuename;>
           Retrieve the data for a given printer setting. See the enumdata command for more information. This
           command corresponds to the GetPrinterData() MS Platform SDK function.

       getdataex
           Get printer driver data with keyname

       getdriver <printername>
           Retrieve the printer driver information (such as driver file, config file, dependent files, etc...) for
           the given printer. This command corresponds to the GetPrinterDriver() MS Platform SDK function. Currently
           info level 1, 2, and 3 are supported.

       getdriverdir <arch>
           Execute a GetPrinterDriverDirectory() RPC to retrieve the SMB share name and subdirectory for storing
           printer driver files for a given architecture. Possible values for arch are "Windows 4.0" (for Windows
           95/98), "Windows NT x86", "Windows NT PowerPC", "Windows Alpha_AXP", and "Windows NT R4000".

       getprinter <printername>
           Retrieve the current printer information. This command corresponds to the GetPrinter() MS Platform SDK
           function.

       getprintprocdir
           Get print processor directory

       openprinter <printername>
           Execute an OpenPrinterEx() and ClosePrinter() RPC against a given printer.

       setdriver <printername> <drivername>
           Execute a SetPrinter() command to update the printer driver associated with an installed printer. The
           printer driver must already be correctly installed on the print server.

           See also the enumprinters and enumdrivers commands for obtaining a list of of installed printers and
           drivers.

BUGS
       rpcclient is designed as a developer testing tool and may not be robust in certain areas (such as command
       line parsing). It has been known to generate a core dump upon failures when invalid parameters where passed
       to the interpreter.

       From Luke Leighton's original rpcclient man page:

       WARNING!  The MSRPC over SMB code has been developed from examining Network traces. No documentation is
       available from the original creators (Microsoft) on how MSRPC over SMB works, or how the individual MSRPC
       services work. Microsoft's implementation of these services has been demonstrated (and reported) to be... a
       bit flaky in places.

       The development of Samba's implementation is also a bit rough, and as more of the services are understood, it
       can even result in versions of smbd(8) and rpcclient(1) that are incompatible for some commands or services.
       Additionally, the developers are sending reports to Microsoft, and problems found or reported to Microsoft
       are fixed in Service Packs, which may result in incompatibilities.

VERSION
       This man page is correct for version 3 of the Samba suite.

AUTHOR
       The original Samba software and related utilities were created by Andrew Tridgell. Samba is now developed by
       the Samba Team as an Open Source project similar to the way the Linux kernel is developed.

       The original rpcclient man page was written by Matthew Geddes, Luke Kenneth Casson Leighton, and rewritten by
       Gerald Carter. The conversion to DocBook for Samba 2.2 was done by Gerald Carter. The conversion to DocBook
       XML 4.2 for Samba 3.0 was done by Alexander Bokovoy.
