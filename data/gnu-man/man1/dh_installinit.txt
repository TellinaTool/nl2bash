DH_INSTALLINIT(1)                                     Debhelper                                    DH_INSTALLINIT(1)



NAME
       dh_installinit - install service init files into package build directories

SYNOPSIS
       dh_installinit [debhelper options] [--name=name] [-n] [-R] [-r] [-d] [-- params]

DESCRIPTION
       dh_installinit is a debhelper program that is responsible for installing init scripts with associated
       defaults files, as well as upstart job files, and systemd service files into package build directories.

       It also automatically generates the postinst and postrm and prerm commands needed to set up the symlinks in
       /etc/rc*.d/ to start and stop the init scripts.

FILES
       debian/package.init
           If this exists, it is installed into etc/init.d/package in the package build directory.

       debian/package.default
           If this exists, it is installed into etc/default/package in the package build directory.

       debian/package.upstart
           If this exists, it is installed into etc/init/package.conf in the package build directory.

       debian/package.service
           If this exists, it is installed into lib/systemd/system/package.service in the package build directory.

       debian/package.tmpfile
           If this exists, it is installed into usr/lib/tmpfiles.d/package.conf in the package build directory. (The
           tmpfiles.d mechanism is currently only used by systemd.)

OPTIONS
       -n, --noscripts
           Do not modify postinst/postrm/prerm scripts.

       -o, --onlyscripts
           Only modify postinst/postrm/prerm scripts, do not actually install any init script, default files,
           upstart job or systemd service file. May be useful if the file is shipped and/or installed by upstream in
           a way that doesn't make it easy to let dh_installinit find it.

       -R, --restart-after-upgrade
           Do not stop the init script until after the package upgrade has been completed. This is different than
           the default behavior, which stops the script in the prerm, and starts it again in the postinst.

           This can be useful for daemons that should not have a possibly long downtime during upgrade. But you
           should make sure that the daemon will not get confused by the package being upgraded while it's running
           before using this option.

       -r, --no-restart-on-upgrade
           Do not stop init script on upgrade.

       --no-start
           Do not start the init script on install or upgrade, or stop it on removal.  Only call update-rc.d. Useful
           for rcS scripts.

       -d, --remove-d
           Remove trailing d from the name of the package, and use the result for the filename the upstart job file
           is installed as in etc/init/ , and for the filename the init script is installed as in etc/init.d and the
           default file is installed as in etc/default/ . This may be useful for daemons with names ending in d.
           (Note: this takes precedence over the --init-script parameter described below.)

       -uparams --update-rcd-params=params
       -- params
           Pass params to update-rc.d(8). If not specified, defaults will be passed to update-rc.d(8).

       --name=name
           Install the init script (and default file) as well as upstart job file using the filename name instead of
           the default filename, which is the package name. When this parameter is used, dh_installinit looks for
           and installs files named debian/package.name.init, debian/package.name.default and
           debian/package.name.upstart instead of the usual debian/package.init, debian/package.default and
           debian/package.upstart.

       --init-script=scriptname
           Use scriptname as the filename the init script is installed as in etc/init.d/ (and also use it as the
           filename for the defaults file, if it is installed). If you use this parameter, dh_installinit will look
           to see if a file in the debian/ directory exists that looks like package.scriptname and if so will
           install it as the init script in preference to the files it normally installs.

           This parameter is deprecated, use the --name parameter instead. This parameter is incompatible with the
           use of upstart jobs.

       --upstart-only
           Deprecated option, ignored for compatibility.

       --error-handler=function
           Call the named shell function if running the init script fails. The function should be provided in the
           prerm and postinst scripts, before the #DEBHELPER# token.

NOTES
       Note that this command is not idempotent. dh_prep(1) should be called between invocations of this command.
       Otherwise, it may cause multiple instances of the same text to be added to maintainer scripts.
