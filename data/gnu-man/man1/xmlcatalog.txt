XMLCATALOG(1)                                     xmlcatalog Manual                                    XMLCATALOG(1)



NAME
       xmlcatalog - Command line tool to parse and manipulate XML or SGML catalog files.

SYNOPSIS
       xmlcatalog [--sgml | --shell | --create | --del VALUE(S) | [ --add TYPE ORIG REPLACE  | --add FILENAME] |
                  --noout | --no-super-update | [-v | --verbose]] {CATALOGFILE} {ENTITIES...}

DESCRIPTION
       xmlcatalog is a command line application allowing users to monitor and manipulate XML and SGML catalogs. It
       is included in libxml(3).

       Its functions can be invoked from a single command from the command line, or it can perform multiple
       functions in interactive mode. It can operate on both XML and SGML files.

OPTIONS
       xmlcatalog accepts the following options (in alphabetical order):

       --add TYPE ORIG REPLACE
           Add an entry to CATALOGFILE.  TYPE indicates the type of entry. Possible types are: public, system, uri,
           rewriteSystem, rewriteURI, delegatePublic, delegateSystem, delegateURI, nextCatalog.  ORIG is the
           original reference to be replaced, and REPLACE is the URI of the replacement entity to be used. The --add
           option will not overwrite CATALOGFILE, outputting to stdout, unless --noout is used. The --add will
           always take three parameters even if some of the XML catalog constructs will have only a single argument.

       --add FILENAME
           If the --add option is used following the --sgml option, only a single argument, a FILENAME, is used.
           This is used to add the name of a catalog file to an SGML supercatalog, a file that contains references
           to other included SGML catalog files.

       --create
           Create a new XML catalog. Outputs to stdout, ignoring filename unless --noout is used, in which case it
           creates a new catalog file filename.

       --del VALUE(S)
           Remove entries from CATALOGFILE matching VALUE(S). The --del option will not overwrite CATALOGFILE,
           outputting to stdout, unless --noout is used.

       --noout
           Save output to the named file rather than outputting to stdout.

       --no-super-update
           Do not update the SGML super catalog.

       --shell
           Run a shell allowing interactive queries on catalog file CATALOGFILE. For the set of available commands
           see the section called “SHELL COMMANDS”.

       --sgml
           Uses SGML super catalogs for --add and --del options.

       -v, --verbose
           Output debugging information.

SHELL COMMANDS
       Invoking xmlcatalog with the --shell CATALOGFILE option opens a command line shell allowing interactive
       access to the catalog file identified by CATALOGFILE. Invoking the shell provides a command line prompt after
       which the following commands (described in alphabetical order) can be entered.

       add TYPE ORIG REPLACE
           Add an entry to the catalog file.  TYPE indicates the type of entry. Possible types are: public, system,
           uri, rewriteSystem, rewriteURI, delegatePublic, delegateSystem, delegateURI, nextCatalog.  ORIG is the
           original reference to be replaced, and REPLACE is the URI of the replacement entity to be used. The --add
           option will not overwrite CATALOGFILE, outputting to stdout, unless --noout is used. The --add will
           always take three parameters even if some of the XML catalog constructs will have only a single argument.

       debug
           Print debugging statements showing the steps xmlcatalog is executing.

       del VALUE(S)
           Remove the catalog entry corresponding to VALUE(S).

       dump
           Print the current catalog.

       exit
           Quit the shell.

       public PUBLIC-ID
           Execute a Formal Public Identifier look-up of the catalog entry for PUBLIC-ID. The corresponding entry
           will be output to the command line.

       quiet
           Stop printing debugging statements.

       system SYSTEM-ID
           Execute a Formal Public Identifier look-up of the catalog entry for SYSTEM-ID. The corresponding entry
           will be output to the command line.

ENVIRONMENT
       XML_CATALOG_FILES
           XML catalog behavior can be changed by redirecting queries to the user's own set of catalogs. This can be
           done by setting the XML_CATALOG_FILES environment variable to a list of catalogs. An empty one should
           deactivate loading the default /etc/xml/catalog catalog.

DIAGNOSTICS
       xmlcatalog return codes provide information that can be used when calling it from scripts.

           No error

       1
           Failed to remove an entry from the catalog
