NAME
       appletviewer - Runs applets outside of a web browser.

SYNOPSIS
       appletviewer [options] url...


       options
              The command-line options separated by spaces. See Options.

       url    The location of the documents or resources to be displayed. You can specify multiple URLs separated by
              spaces.

DESCRIPTION
       The appletviewer command connects to the documents or resources designated by urls and displays each applet
       referenced by the documents in its own window. If the documents referred to by urls do not reference any
       applets with the OBJECT, EMBED, or APPLET tag, then the appletviewer command does nothing. For details about
       the HTML tags that the appletviewer command supports, see AppletViewer Tags at
       http://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/technotes/tools/appletviewertags.html

       The appletviewer command requires encoded URLs according to the escaping mechanism defined in RFC2396. Only
       encoded URLs are supported. However, file names must be unencoded, as specified in RFC2396.

       Note: The appletviewer command is intended for development purposes only. For more information, see About
       Sample/Test Applications and Code at
       http://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/technotes/samples/aboutCodeSamples.html

OPTIONS
       -debug
              Starts the Applet Viewer in the Java debugger with the jdb command to debug the applets in the
              document.

       -encoding encoding-name
              Specifies the input HTML file encoding name.

       -Jjavaoption
              Passes the string javaoption as a single argument to the Java interpreter, which runs the Applet
              Viewer. The argument should not contain spaces. Multiple argument words must all begin with the prefix
              -J. This is useful for adjusting the compiler's execution environment or memory usage.
