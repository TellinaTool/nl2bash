NAME
       apg - generates several random passwords


SYNOPSIS
       apg  [-a algorithm] [-M mode] [-E char_string] [-n num_of_pass] [-m min_pass_len] [-x max_pass_len] [-r dict‐
       file] [-b filter_file] [-p min_substr_len] [-s] [-c cl_seed] [-d] [-y] [-l] [-t] [-q] [-h] [-v]

DESCRIPTION
       apg generates several random passwords. It uses several password generation algorithms (currently two) and  a
       built-in pseudo random number generator.

       Default algorithm is pronounceable password generation algorithm designed by Morrie Gasser and described in A
       Random Word Generator For Pronounceable Passwords National Technical Information Service (NTIS)  AD-A-017676.
       The  original paper is very old and had never been put online, so I have to use NIST implementation described
       in FIPS-181.

       Another algorithm is simple random character generation algorithm, but it uses four user-defined symbol  sets
       to  produce  random  password.  It means that user can choose type of symbols that should appear in password.
       Symbol sets are: numeric symbol set (0,...,9) , capital letters symbol set (A,...,Z) , small  letters  symbol
       set (a,...,z) and special symbols symbol set (#,@,!,...).

       Built-in  pseudo  random  number  generator is an implementation of algorithm described in Appendix C of ANSI
       X9.17 or RFC1750 with exception that it uses CAST or SHA-1 instead of Triple DES.  It uses  local  time  with
       precision  of  microseconds  (see  gettimeofday(2))  and /dev/random (if available) to produce initial random
       seed.

       apg also have the ability to check generated password quality using dictionary. You can use this  ability  if
       you  specify command-line options -r dictfile or -b filtername where dictfile is the dictionary file name and
       filtername is the name of Bloom filter file. In that dictionary you may  place  words  (one  per  line)  that
       should not appear as generated passwords. For example: user names, common words, etc. You even can use one of
       the dictionaries that come with dictionary password crackers.  Bloom filter file should be created with  apg‐
       bfm(1)  utility included in apg distribution. In future releases I plan to implement some other techniques to
       check passwords (like pattern check) just to make life easier.


OPTIONS
   Password generation modes options
       -a algorithm
              use algorithm for password generation.
              0 - (default) pronounceable password generation
              1 - random character password generation

       -n num_of_pass
              generate num_of_pass number of passwords. Default is 6.

       -m min_pass_len
              generate password with minimum length min_pass_len.  If min_pass_len > max_pass_len then  max_pass_len
              = min_pass_len.  Default minimum password length is 8.

       -x max_pass_len
              generate  password with maximum length max_pass_len.  If min_pass_len > max_pass_len then max_pass_len
              = min_pass_len.  Default maximum password length is 10.

       -M mode
              Use symbolsets specified with mode for password generation.  mode is a text string consisting of char‐
              acters S, s, N, n, C, c, L, l. Where:

              S      generator must use special symbol set for every generated password.

              s      generator should use special symbol set for password generation.

              N      generator must use numeral symbol set for every generated password.

              n      generator should use numeral symbol set for password generation.

              C      generator must use capital symbol set for every generated password.

              c      generator should use capital symbol set for password generation.

              L      generator  must  use  small  letters symbol set for every generated password (always present if
                     pronounceable password generation algorithm is used).

              l      generator should use small letters symbol set for password generation.

              R,r    not supported any more. Use -E char_string option instead.
              mode can not be more than 4 characters in length.

              Note:
              Usage of L, M, N, C will slow down password generation process.

              Examples:
              -M sncl or -M SNCL or -M Cn

       -E char_string
              exclude characters in char_string from password generation process (in pronounceable password  genera‐
              tion  mode  you  can  not exclude small letters). To include special symbols that can be recognized by
              shell (apostrophe, quotes, dollar sign, etc.) in char_string use the backslashed versions.

              Examples:

              Command apg -a 1 -M n -n 3 -m 8 -E 23456789 will generate a set of passwords that will look like this
              10100110
              01111000
              11011101

              Command apg -a 1 -M nc -n 3 -m 26 -E GHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ will generate a set of passwords  that  will
              look like this
              16A1653CD4DE5E7BD9584A3476
              C8F78E06944AFD57FB9CB882BC
              8C8DF37CD792D36D056BBD5002

   Password quality control options
       -r dictfile
              check generated passwords for their appearance in dictfile

       -b filter_file
              check generated passwords for their appearance in filter_file. filter_file should be created with apg‐
              bfm(1) utility.

       -p min_substr_len
              this option tells apg(1) to check every substring of the generated password  for  appearance  in  fil‐
              ter_file. If any of such substrings would be found in the filter_file then generated password would be
              rejected and apg(1) will generate another one.  min_substr_len specifies minimum substring  length  to
              check.  This option is active only if -b option is defined.

   Pseudo random number generator options
       -s     ask user for random sequence for password generation

       -c cl_seed
              use  cl_seed as a random seed for password generation. I use it when i have to generate passwords in a
              shell script.

   Password output options
       -d     do NOT use any delimiters between generated passwords. I use it when i have to generate passwords in a
              shell script.

       -y     print generated passwords and crypted passwords (see man crypt(3))

       -q     quiet mode (do not print warnings)

       -l     spell genetated passwords. Useful when you want to read generated password by telephone.
              WARNING: Think twice before read your password by phone.

       -t     print pronunciation for generated pronounceable password

       -h     print help information and exit

       -v     print version information and exit

DEFAULT OPTIONS
       apg -a 0 -M sncl -n 6 -x 10 -m 8 (new style)

       If  you  want  to  generate really secure passwords, you should use option -s. To simplify apg usage, you can
       write a small shell script. For example:
       [begin]----> pwgen.sh
       #!/bin/sh
       /usr/local/bin/apg -m 8 -x 12 -s
       [ end ]----> pwgen.sh

EXIT CODE
       On successful completion of its task, apg will complete with exit code 0.  An exit code of  -1  indicates  an
       error occurred.  Textual errors are written to the standard error stream.

DIAGNOSTICS
       If /dev/random is not available, apg will display a message about it.

FILES
       None.

BUGS
       None.  If you've found one, please send bug description to the author.
