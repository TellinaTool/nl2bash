bmptopnm(1)                                    General Commands Manual                                   bmptopnm(1)



NAME
       bmptopnm - convert a BMP file into a portable anymap


SYNOPSIS
       bmptopnm [bmpfile]


DESCRIPTION
       Reads  a  Microsoft  Windows or OS/2 BMP file as input.  Produces a PBM, PGM, or PNM image as output.  If the
       input is colormapped and contains only black and white, the output is PBM.  If the input is  colormapped  and
       contains only black white and gray, the output is PGM.  Otherwise, the output is PPM.

       This  program  cannot  convert  BMP files with compressed (run length encoded) image data.  It recognizes the
       compression and issues an error message.

       This program cannot convert BMP files with 16 bits per pixel (only because the author did not have a complete
       specification for them).  It recognizes the format and issues an error message.
