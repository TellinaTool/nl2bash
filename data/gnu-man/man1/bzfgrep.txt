NAME
       bzgrep, bzfgrep, bzegrep - search possibly bzip2 compressed files for a regular expression

SYNOPSIS
       bzgrep [ grep_options ] [ -e ] pattern filename...
       bzegrep [ egrep_options ] [ -e ] pattern filename...
       bzfgrep [ fgrep_options ] [ -e ] pattern filename...

DESCRIPTION
       Bzgrep  is  used  to  invoke the grep on bzip2-compressed files. All options specified are passed directly to
       grep.  If no file is specified, then the standard input is decompressed if necessary and fed to grep.  Other‐
       wise the given files are uncompressed if necessary and fed to grep.

       If bzgrep is invoked as bzegrep or bzfgrep then egrep or fgrep is used instead of grep.  If the GREP environ‐
       ment variable is set, bzgrep uses it as the grep program to be invoked. For example:

           for sh:  GREP=fgrep  bzgrep string files
           for csh: (setenv GREP fgrep; bzgrep string files)
