pamfile(1)                                     General Commands Manual                                    pamfile(1)



NAME
       pamfile - describe a Netpbm (PAM or PNM) file

SYNOPSIS
       pamfile [-allimages] [file ...]


DESCRIPTION
       Reads  one  or more Netpbm files as input.  Writes out short descriptions of the image type, size, etc.  This
       is mostly for use in shell scripts, so the format is not particularly pretty.


OPTIONS
       -allimages
              Describe every image in each input file.  Without this option, pamfile describes only the first  image
              in each input file.  Note that before July 2000, a file could not contain more than one image and many
              programs ignore all but the first.


SEE ALSO
       pam(5), file(1)
