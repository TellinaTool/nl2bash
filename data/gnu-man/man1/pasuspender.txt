NAME
       pasuspender - Temporarily suspend PulseAudio

SYNOPSIS
       pasuspender [options] -- PROGRAM [ARGUMENTS ...]

       pasuspender --help

       pasuspender --version

DESCRIPTION
       pasuspender  is a tool that can be used to tell a local PulseAudio sound server to temporarily suspend access
       to the audio devices, to allow other applications access them directly. pasuspender will  suspend  access  to
       the audio devices, fork a child process, and when the child process terminates, resume access again.

       Make sure to include -- in your pasuspender command line before passing the subprocess command line (as shown
       above). Otherwise pasuspender itself might end up interpreting the command  line  switches  and  options  you
       intended to pass to the subprocess.
