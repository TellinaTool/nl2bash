mdir(1)                                        General Commands Manual                                       mdir(1)



Name
       mdir - display an MSDOS directory



Note of warning
       This  manpage  has  been automatically generated from mtools's texinfo documentation, and may not be entirely
       accurate or complete.  See the end of this man page for details.

Description
       The mdir command is used to display an MS-DOS directory. Its syntax is:

       mdir [-/] [-f] [-w] [-a] [-b] msdosfile [ msdosfiles...]

       Mdir displays the contents of MS-DOS directories, or the entries for some MS-DOS files.

       Mdir supports the following command line options:

       /      Recursive output, just like MS-DOS' -s option

       w      Wide output.  With this option, mdir prints the filenames across the page without displaying the  file
              size or creation date.

       a      Also list hidden files.

       f      Fast.  Do not try to find out free space.  On larger disks, finding out the amount of free space takes
              up some non trivial amount of time, as the whole FAT must  be  read  in  and  scanned.   The  -f  flag
              bypasses this step.  This flag is not needed on FAT32 file systems, which store the size explicitly.

       b      Concise  listing.  Lists  each directory name or filename, one per line (including the filename exten‐
              sion). This switch displays no heading information and no summary. Only a newline  separated  list  of
              pathnames is displayed.

       An error occurs if a component of the path is not a directory.

Viewing the texi doc
       This  manpage  has been automatically generated from mtools's texinfo documentation. However, this process is
       only approximative, and some items, such as crossreferences, footnotes and indices are lost in this  transla‐
       tion  process.   Indeed, these items have no appropriate representation in the manpage format.  Moreover, not
       all information has been translated into the manpage version.  Thus I strongly advise you to use the original
       texinfo doc.  See the end of this manpage for instructions how to view the texinfo doc.

       *      To generate a printable copy from the texinfo doc, run the following commands:

                     ./configure; make dvi; dvips mtools.dvi



       *      To generate a html copy,  run:

                     ./configure; make html

       A premade html can be found at `http://www.gnu.org/software/mtools/manual/mtools.html'

       *      To generate an info copy (browsable using emacs' info mode), run:

                     ./configure; make info



       The  texinfo doc looks most pretty when printed or as html.  Indeed, in the info version certain examples are
       difficult to read due to the quoting conventions used in info.
