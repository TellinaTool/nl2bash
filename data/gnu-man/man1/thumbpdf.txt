NAME
       thumbpdf - generate thumbnail images for a PDF file created with pdftex

SYNOPSIS
       thumbpdf [ OPTION... ]  PDF_FILE

DESCRIPTION
       thumbpdf is used to create thumbnail images of individual pages within a PDF (Portable Document Format) docu‐
       ment.

USAGE
       First run pdftex(1) on your document to create a PDF file.  Then run thumbpdf to generate the  thumbnails,  a
       PDF  file  containing  the thumbnails, and a pdfTeX file to include the thumbnails in the PDF file.  Finally,
       run pdftex(1) on your file again to create the final PDF file.

       thumbpdf calls gs(1) to generate PNG images of the pages within PDF_FILE, and pdftex(1) to create a PDF  file
       containing the thumbnail images.
