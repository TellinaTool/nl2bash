NAME
       split - split a file into pieces

SYNOPSIS
       split [OPTION]... [INPUT [PREFIX]]

DESCRIPTION
       Output  fixed-size pieces of INPUT to PREFIXaa, PREFIXab, ...; default size is 1000 lines, and default PREFIX
       is 'x'.  With no INPUT, or when INPUT is -, read standard input.

       Mandatory arguments to long options are mandatory for short options too.

       -a, --suffix-length=N
              generate suffixes of length N (default 2)

       --additional-suffix=SUFFIX
              append an additional SUFFIX to file names.

       -b, --bytes=SIZE
              put SIZE bytes per output file

       -C, --line-bytes=SIZE
              put at most SIZE bytes of lines per output file

       -d, --numeric-suffixes[=FROM]
              use numeric suffixes instead of alphabetic.  FROM changes the start value (default 0).

       -e, --elide-empty-files
              do not generate empty output files with '-n'

       --filter=COMMAND
              write to shell COMMAND; file name is $FILE

       -l, --lines=NUMBER
              put NUMBER lines per output file

       -n, --number=CHUNKS
              generate CHUNKS output files.  See below

       -u, --unbuffered
              immediately copy input to output with '-n r/...'

       --verbose
              print a diagnostic just before each output file is opened

       --help display this help and exit

       --version
              output version information and exit

       SIZE is an integer and optional unit (example: 10M is 10*1024*1024).  Units are K, M, G, T, P, E, Z, Y  (pow‐
       ers of 1024) or KB, MB, ... (powers of 1000).

       CHUNKS  may  be:  N        split  into  N  files based on size of input K/N     output Kth of N to stdout l/N
       split into N files without splitting lines l/K/N   output Kth of N to  stdout  without  splitting  lines  r/N
       like 'l' but use round robin distribution r/K/N   likewise but only output Kth of N to stdout
