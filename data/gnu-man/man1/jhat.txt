NAME
       jhat - Analyzes the Java heap. This command is experimental and unsupported.

SYNOPSIS
       jhat [ options ] heap-dump-file


       options
              The command-line options. See Options.

       heap-dump-file
              Java binary heap dump file to be browsed. For a dump file that contains multiple heap dumps, you can
              specify which dump in the file by appending #<number> to the file name, for example, myfile.hprof#3.

DESCRIPTION
       The jhat command parses a Java heap dump file and starts a web server. The jhat command lets you to browse
       heap dumps with your favorite web browser. The jhat command supports predesigned queries such as show all
       instances of a known class MyClass, and Object Query Language (OQL). OQL is similar to SQL, except for
       querying heap dumps. Help on OQL is available from the OQL help page shown by the jhat command. With the
       default port, OQL help is available at http://localhost:7000/oqlhelp/

       There are several ways to generate a Java heap dump:

       · Use the jmap -dump option to obtain a heap dump at runtime. See jmap(1).

       · Use the jconsole option to obtain a heap dump through HotSpotDiagnosticMXBean at runtime. See jconsole(1)
         and the HotSpotDiagnosticMXBean interface description at
         http://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/jre/api/management/extension/com/sun/management/HotSpotDiagnosticMXBean.html

       · Heap dump is generated when an OutOfMemoryError is thrown by specifying the -XX:+HeapDumpOnOutOfMemoryError
         Java Virtual Machine (JVM) option.

       · Use the hprof command. See the HPROF: A Heap/CPU Profiling Tool at
         http://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/technotes/samples/hprof.html

OPTIONS
       -stack false|true
              Turns off tracking object allocation call stack. If allocation site information is not available in
              the heap dump, then you have to set this flag to false. The default is true.

       -refs false|true
              Turns off tracking of references to objects. Default is true. By default, back pointers, which are
              objects that point to a specified object such as referrers or incoming references, are calculated for
              all objects in the heap.

       -port port-number
              Sets the port for the jhat HTTP server. Default is 7000.

       -exclude exclude-file
              Specifies a file that lists data members that should be excluded from the reachable objects query. For
              example, if the file lists java.lang.String.value, then, then whenever the list of objects that are
              reachable from a specific object o are calculated, reference paths that involve java.lang.String.value
              field are not considered.

       -baseline exclude-file
              Specifies a baseline heap dump. Objects in both heap dumps with the same object ID are marked as not
              being new. Other objects are marked as new. This is useful for comparing two different heap dumps.

       -debug int
              Sets the debug level for this tool. A level of 0 means no debug output. Set higher values for more
              verbose modes.

       -version
              Reports the release number and exits

       -h
              Dsiplays a help message and exits.

       -help
              Displays a help message and exits.

       -Jflag
              Passes flag to the Java Virtual Machine on which the jhat command is running. For example, -J-Xmx512m
              to use a maximum heap size of 512 MB.
