NAME
       ximtoppm - convert an Xim file into a portable pixmap

SYNOPSIS
       ximtoppm [--alphaout={alpha-filename,-}] [ximfile]

DESCRIPTION
       Reads  an  Xim file as input.  Produces a portable pixmap as output.  The Xim toolkit is included in the con‐
       trib tree of the X.V11R4 release.

OPTIONS
       --alphaout=alpha-filename
              ximtoppm creates a PGM (portable graymap) file containing the alpha channel values in the input image.
              If the input image doesn't contain an alpha channel, the alpha-filename file contains all zero (trans‐
              parent) alpha values.  If you don't specify --alphaout, ximtoppm does not generate an alpha file,  and
              if the input image has an alpha channel, ximtoppm simply discards it.

              If you specify - as the filename, ximtoppm writes the alpha output to Standard Output and discards the
              image.

              Actually, an Xim image can contain an arbitrary fourth channel -- it need not  be  an  Alpha  channel.
              ximtoppm  extracts any fourth channel it finds as described above; it doesn't matter if it is an alpha
              channel or not.

              See pnmcomp(1) for one way to use the alpha output file.


       All options can be abbreviated to their shortest unique prefix.
