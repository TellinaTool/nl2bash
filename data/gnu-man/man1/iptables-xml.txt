IPTABLES-XML(1)                                    iptables 1.4.21                                   IPTABLES-XML(1)



NAME
       iptables-xml — Convert iptables-save format to XML

SYNOPSIS
       iptables-xml [-c] [-v]

DESCRIPTION
       iptables-xml  is  used to convert the output of iptables-save into an easily manipulatable XML format to STD‐
       OUT.  Use I/O-redirection provided by your shell to write to a file.

       -c, --combine
              combine consecutive rules with the same matches but different targets.  iptables  does  not  currently
              support more than one target per match, so this simulates that by collecting the targets from consecu‐
              tive iptables rules into one action tag, but only when the rule  matches  are  identical.  Terminating
              actions like RETURN, DROP, ACCEPT and QUEUE are not combined with subsequent targets.

       -v, --verbose
              Output xml comments containing the iptables line from which the XML is derived


       iptables-xml  does a mechanistic conversion to a very expressive xml format; the only semantic considerations
       are for -g and -j targets in order to discriminate between <call> <goto> and <nane-of-target> as it helps xml
       processing scripts if they can tell the difference between a target like SNAT and another chain.

       Some sample output is:

       <iptables-rules>
         <table name="mangle">
           <chain name="PREROUTING" policy="ACCEPT" packet-count="63436" byte-count="7137573">
             <rule>
              <conditions>
               <match>
                 <p>tcp</p>
               </match>
               <tcp>
                 <sport>8443</sport>
               </tcp>
              </conditions>
              <actions>
               <call>
                 <check_ip/>
               </call>
               <ACCEPT/>
              </actions>
             </rule>
           </chain>
         </table> </iptables-rules>


       Conversion  from  XML  to  iptables-save format may be done using the iptables.xslt script and xsltproc, or a
       custom program using libxsltproc or similar; in this fashion:

       xsltproc iptables.xslt my-iptables.xml | iptables-restore
