NAME
       detex - a filter to strip TeX commands from a .tex file.

SYNOPSIS
       detex [ -clnstw ] [ -e environment-list ] [ filename[.tex] ... ]

DESCRIPTION
       Detex  (Version  2.6)  reads each file in sequence, removes all comments and TeX control sequences and writes
       the remainder on the standard output.  All text in math mode and display mode is removed.  By default,  detex
       follows  \input  commands.   If  a  file  cannot  be  opened, a warning message is printed and the command is
       ignored.  If the -n option is used, no \input or \include commands will be  processed.   This  allows  single
       file processing.  If no input file is given on the command line, detex reads from standard input.

       If the magic sequence ``\begin{document}'' appears in the text, detex assumes it is dealing with LaTeX source
       and detex recognizes additional constructs used in LaTeX.  These include the \include and  \includeonly  com‐
       mands.  The -l option can be used to force LaTeX mode and the -t option can be used to force TeX mode regard‐
       less of input content.

       Text in various environment modes of LaTeX is ignored.  The default modes are array, eqnarray, equation, fig‐
       ure,  mathmatica,  picture, table and verbatim.  The -e option can be used to specify a comma separated envi‐
       ronment-list of environments to ignore.  The list replaces the defaults so specifying an  empty  list  effec‐
       tively causes no environments to be ignored.

       The -c option can be used in LaTeX mode to have detex echo the arguments to \cite, \ref, and \pageref macros.
       This can be useful when sending the output to a style checker.

       Detex assumes the standard character classes are being used for TeX.  Detex allows white space  between  con‐
       trol sequences and magic characters like `{' when recognizing things like LaTeX environments.

       If the -w flag is given, the output is a word list, one `word' (string of two or more letters and apostrophes
       beginning with a letter) per line, and all other characters ignored.  Without -w the output follows the orig‐
       inal,  with the deletions mentioned above.  Newline characters are preserved where possible so that the lines
       of output match the input as closely as possible.

       The TEXINPUTS environment variable is used to find \input and \include files.   Like  TeX,  it  interprets  a
       leading  or  trailing  `:'  as the default TEXINPUTS.  It does not support the `//' directory expansion magic
       sequence.

       Detex now handles the basic TeX ligatures as a special case, replacing the ligatures with acceptable charater
       substitutes.   This  eliminates  spelling  errors introduced by merely removing them.  The ligatures are \aa,
       \ae, \oe, \ss, \o, \l (and their upper-case equivalents).  The special "dotless" characters  \i  and  \j  are
       also replaced with i and j respectively.

       Note  that previous versions of detex would replace control sequences with a space character to prevent words
       from running together.  However, this caused accents in the  middle  of  words  to  break  words,  generating
       "spelling errors" that were not desirable.  Therefore, the new version merely removes these accents.  The old
       functionality can be essentially duplicated by using the -s option.

DIAGNOSTICS
       Nesting of \input is allowed but the number of opened files must not exceed the system's limit on the  number
       of  simultaneously  opened files.  Detex ignores unrecognized option characters after printing a warning mes‐
       sage.

BUGS
       Detex is not a complete TeX interpreter, so it can be confused by some constructs.  Most errors result in too
       much rather than too little output.

       Running LaTeX source without a ``\begin{document}'' through detex may produce errors.

       Suggestions for improvements are (mildly) encouraged.
