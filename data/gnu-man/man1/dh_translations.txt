NAME
       dh_translations - perform common translation related operations

SYNOPSIS
       dh_translations [debhelper options]

DESCRIPTION
       dh_translations is a debhelper program to perform common translation related operations during package build:

       ·   Try to build a current PO template.

       ·   Remove inline translations from *.desktop, *.server, *.schemas, and *.policy files and replace them with
           a link to the gettext domain, so that strings in them will get translated at runtime from *.mo files.
           This allows language packs to ship updated translations.
