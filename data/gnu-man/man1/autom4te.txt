NAME
       autom4te - Generate files and scripts thanks to M4

SYNOPSIS
       autom4te [OPTION]... [FILES]

DESCRIPTION
       Run  GNU  M4 on the FILES, avoiding useless runs.  Output the traces if tracing, the frozen file if freezing,
       otherwise the expansion of the FILES.

       If some of the FILES are named `FILE.m4f' they are considered to be M4 frozen files of all the previous files
       (which are therefore not loaded).  If `FILE.m4f' is not found, then `FILE.m4' will be used, together with all
       the previous files.

       Some files may be optional, i.e., will only be processed if found in the include path, but then must  end  in
       `.m4?';  the question mark is not part of the actual file name.

   Operation modes:
       -h, --help
              print this help, then exit

       -V, --version
              print version number, then exit

       -v, --verbose

       -d, --debug
              don't remove temporary files

       -o, --output=FILE
              save output in FILE (defaults to `-', stdout)

       -f, --force
              don't rely on cached values

       -W, --warnings=CATEGORY
              report the warnings falling in CATEGORY

       -l, --language=LANG

       -t, --trace=MACRO[:FORMAT]
              report the MACRO invocations

       -p, --preselect=MACRO
              prepare to trace MACRO in a future run

   Freezing:
       -F, --freeze
              produce an M4 frozen state file for FILES

   FORMAT defaults to `$f:$l:$n:$%', and can use the following escapes:
       $$     literal $

       $f     file where macro was called

       $l     line where macro was called

       $d     nesting depth of macro call

       $n     name of the macro

       $NUM   argument NUM, unquoted and with newlines

       $SEP@  all arguments, with newlines, quoted, and separated by SEP

       $SEP*  all arguments, with newlines, unquoted, and separated by SEP

       $SEP%  all arguments, without newlines, unquoted, and separated by SEP

       SEP  can be empty for the default (comma for @ and *, colon for %), a single character for that character, or
       {STRING} to use a string.
