DESCRIPTION
       mousetweaks is a collection of accessibility enhancements for pointing devices. This  manual  page  describes
       the mousetweaks daemon.

OPTIONS
       --dwell
              Automatically perform mouse clicks without using a physical button.

       --ssc  Trigger  the  secondary mouse button when the primary mouse button is held down for a specified amount
              of time.

       --dwell-time=FLOAT
              Time to keep the pointer motionless before a dwell click is performed.  Range: 0.2 - 3.0 seconds.

       --ssc-time=FLOAT
              Time to hold the primary mouse button before a simulated secondary click is performed.  Range:  0.5  -
              3.0 seconds.

       -m, --dwell-mode=STRING
              Select  a  dwell  mode.  Available  options:  window  - Select the click type from a window or a panel
              applet.  gesture - Perform different clicks by moving in different directions.

       -c, --show-ctw
              Show the click-type window. Only useful in combination with --dwell-mode=window.

       -t, --threshold=INT
              Ignore small pointer movements. Range: 0 - 30 pixels.

       -g, --geometry
              Size and position of the click-type window. Expects a standard X Window System  geometry  string.  ie.
              WIDTHxHEIGHT+X+Y

       -s, --shutdown
              Stop the mousetweaks daemon.

       --daemonize
              Start mousetweaks in the background, ie. spawn a child process.

       --login
              Start mousetweaks in login mode. Login mode enables workarounds specific to GDM. Currently unused.

FILES
       mousetweaks.pid
              The  daemon  creates a lock file in the $XDG_RUNTIME_DIR directory to keep track of its state. On sys‐
              tems with no user runtime directory, the $XDG_CACHE_HOME directory is used.
