NAME
       gdb - The GNU Debugger

SYNOPSIS
       gdb [-help] [-nh] [-nx] [-q] [-batch] [-cd=dir] [-f] [-b bps]
           [-tty=dev] [-s symfile] [-e prog] [-se prog] [-c core] [-p procID]
           [-x cmds] [-d dir] [prog|prog procID|prog core]

DESCRIPTION
       The purpose of a debugger such as GDB is to allow you to see what is going on "inside" another program while
       it executes -- or what another program was doing at the moment it crashed.

       GDB can do four main kinds of things (plus other things in support of these) to help you catch bugs in the
       act:

       ·   Start your program, specifying anything that might affect its behavior.

       ·   Make your program stop on specified conditions.

       ·   Examine what has happened, when your program has stopped.

       ·   Change things in your program, so you can experiment with correcting the effects of one bug and go on to
           learn about another.

       You can use GDB to debug programs written in C, C@t{++}, Fortran and Modula-2.

       GDB is invoked with the shell command "gdb".  Once started, it reads commands from the terminal until you
       tell it to exit with the GDB command "quit".  You can get online help from GDB itself by using the command
       "help".

       You can run "gdb" with no arguments or options; but the most usual way to start GDB is with one argument or
       two, specifying an executable program as the argument:

               gdb program

       You can also start with both an executable program and a core file specified:

               gdb program core

       You can, instead, specify a process ID as a second argument, if you want to debug a running process:

               gdb program 1234
               gdb -p 1234

       would attach GDB to process 1234 (unless you also have a file named 1234; GDB does check for a core file
       first).  With option -p you can omit the program filename.

       Here are some of the most frequently needed GDB commands:

       break [file:]functiop
           Set a breakpoint at function (in file).

       run [arglist]
           Start your program (with arglist, if specified).

       bt  Backtrace: display the program stack.

       print expr
           Display the value of an expression.

       c   Continue running your program (after stopping, e.g. at a breakpoint).

       next
           Execute next program line (after stopping); step over any function calls in the line.

       edit [file:]function
           look at the program line where it is presently stopped.

       list [file:]function
           type the text of the program in the vicinity of where it is presently stopped.

       step
           Execute next program line (after stopping); step into any function calls in the line.

       help [name]
           Show information about GDB command name, or general information about using GDB.

       quit
           Exit from GDB.

       For full details on GDB, see Using GDB: A Guide to the GNU Source-Level Debugger, by Richard M. Stallman and
       Roland H. Pesch.  The same text is available online as the "gdb" entry in the "info" program.

OPTIONS
       Any arguments other than options specify an executable file and core file (or process ID); that is, the first
       argument encountered with no associated option flag is equivalent to a -se option, and the second, if any, is
       equivalent to a -c option if it's the name of a file.  Many options have both long and short forms; both are
       shown here.  The long forms are also recognized if you truncate them, so long as enough of the option is
       present to be unambiguous.  (If you prefer, you can flag option arguments with + rather than -, though we
       illustrate the more usual convention.)

       All the options and command line arguments you give are processed in sequential order.  The order makes a
       difference when the -x option is used.

       -help
       -h  List all options, with brief explanations.

       -symbols=file
       -s file
           Read symbol table from file file.

       -write
           Enable writing into executable and core files.

       -exec=file
       -e file
           Use file file as the executable file to execute when appropriate, and for examining pure data in
           conjunction with a core dump.

       -se=file
           Read symbol table from file file and use it as the executable file.

       -core=file
       -c file
           Use file file as a core dump to examine.

       -command=file
       -x file
           Execute GDB commands from file file.

       -ex command
           Execute given GDB command.

       -directory=directory
       -d directory
           Add directory to the path to search for source files.

       -nh Do not execute commands from ~/.gdbinit.

       -nx
       -n  Do not execute commands from any .gdbinit initialization files.

       -quiet
       -q  "Quiet".  Do not print the introductory and copyright messages.  These messages are also suppressed in
           batch mode.

       -batch
           Run in batch mode.  Exit with status 0 after processing all the command files specified with -x (and
           .gdbinit, if not inhibited).  Exit with nonzero status if an error occurs in executing the GDB commands
           in the command files.

           Batch mode may be useful for running GDB as a filter, for example to download and run a program on
           another computer; in order to make this more useful, the message

                   Program exited normally.

           (which is ordinarily issued whenever a program running under GDB control terminates) is not issued when
           running in batch mode.

       -cd=directory
           Run GDB using directory as its working directory, instead of the current directory.

       -fullname
       -f  Emacs sets this option when it runs GDB as a subprocess.  It tells GDB to output the full file name and
           line number in a standard, recognizable fashion each time a stack frame is displayed (which includes each
           time the program stops).  This recognizable format looks like two \032 characters, followed by the file
           name, line number and character position separated by colons, and a newline.  The Emacs-to-GDB interface
           program uses the two \032 characters as a signal to display the source code for the frame.

       -b bps
           Set the line speed (baud rate or bits per second) of any serial interface used by GDB for remote
           debugging.

       -tty=device
           Run using device for your program's standard input and output.

SEE ALSO
       The full documentation for GDB is maintained as a Texinfo manual.  If the "info" and "gdb" programs and GDB's
       Texinfo documentation are properly installed at your site, the command

               info gdb

       should give you access to the complete manual.
