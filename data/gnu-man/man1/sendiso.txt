NAME
       sendiso - send IEEE 1394 isochronous packets from dump file

SYNOPSIS
       sendiso [ options ] FILE

DESCRIPTION
       sendiso takes the dump file FILE as generated by dumpiso(1), extracts the packets and sends them as they were
       received (in the same order, with the same channel numbers) as fast as possible - timing of the original dump
       is not preserved.

       This  program  does not allocate any isochronous resources but just starts sending.  It should not be used in
       live environments where it might interfere with properly set up isochronous transmissions, it is a debug  and
       performance benchmarking tool.

OPTIONS
       -l, --loop=COUNT
              Send dump file COUNT times.  Defaults to 1.

       -i, --infinite
              Send dump file in an endless loop.

       -s, --speed=SPEED
              Send packets at speed SPEED, which can be given as 100, 200 and 400 (in Mbit/s) or abbreviated as 1, 2
              and 4.  Defaults to 100.

       -p, --port=PORT
              Choose port PORT for sending.  A port is a 1394 card or chip and represents one connected bus,  there‐
              fore this is only relevant when you have multiple of these.  Defaults to 0.

       -h, --help
              Show help text and exit.

BUGS
       None known.
