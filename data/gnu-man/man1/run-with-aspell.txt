RUN-WITH-ASPELL(1)                        Aspell Abbreviated User's Manual                        RUN-WITH-ASPELL(1)



NAME
       run-with-aspell - script to help use GNU Aspell as an ispell replacement

SYNOPSIS
       run-with-aspell <command>

DESCRIPTION
       The recommended way to use Aspell as a replacement for Ispell is to change the Ispell command from within the
       program being used.  If that is not possible, the run-with-aspell script may be used instead.

OPTIONS
       <command>
              is the name of the program with any optional arguments.

       The old method of mapping ispell to Aspell is discouraged because it can create compatibility  problems  with
       programs that actually require ispell such as ispell's own scripts.

SEE ALSO
       aspell(1), aspell-import(1), word-list-compress(1)

       Aspell  is fully documented in its Texinfo manual.  See the `aspell' entry in info for more complete documen‐
       tation.
