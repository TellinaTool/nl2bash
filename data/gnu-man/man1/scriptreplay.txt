NAME
       scriptreplay - play back typescripts, using timing information

SYNOPSIS
       scriptreplay [options] [-t] timingfile [typescript [divisor]]

DESCRIPTION
       This program replays a typescript, using timing information to ensure that output happens at the same speed
       as it originally appeared when the script was recorded.

       The replay simply displays the information again; the programs that were run when the typescript was being
       recorded are not run again.  Since the same information is simply being displayed, scriptreplay is only guar‐
       anteed to work properly if run on the same type of terminal the typescript was recorded on.  Otherwise, any
       escape characters in the typescript may be interpreted differently by the terminal to which scriptreplay is
       sending its output.

       The timing information is what script(1) outputs to standard error if it is run with the -t parameter.

       By default, the typescript to display is assumed to be named "typescript", but other filenames may be speci‐
       fied, as the second parameter or with option -s.

       If the third parameter is specified, it is used as a speed-up multiplier.  For example, a speed-up of 2 makes
       scriptreplay go twice as fast, and a speed-up of 0.1 makes it go ten times slower than the original session.

OPTIONS
       The first three options will overide old-style arguments.

       -t, --timing file
              File containing script timing output.

       -s, --typescript file
              File containing the script terminal output.

       -d, --divisor number
              Speed up the replay displaying this number of times.  The argument is a floating point number.  It's
              called divisor because it divides the timings by this factor.

       -V, --version
              Display version information and exit.

       -h, --help
              Display a help message and exit.

EXAMPLE
        % script -t 2> timingfile
        Script started, file is typescript
        % ls
        <etc, etc>
        % exit
        Script done, file is typescript
        % scriptreplay timingfile
