DH_USRLOCAL(1)                                        Debhelper                                       DH_USRLOCAL(1)



NAME
       dh_usrlocal - migrate usr/local directories to maintainer scripts

SYNOPSIS
       dh_usrlocal [debhelper options] [-n]

DESCRIPTION
       dh_usrlocal is a debhelper program that can be used for building packages that will provide a subdirectory in
       /usr/local when installed.

       It finds subdirectories of usr/local in the package build directory, and removes them, replacing them with
       maintainer script snippets (unless -n is used) to create the directories at install time, and remove them
       when the package is removed, in a manner compliant with Debian policy. These snippets are inserted into the
       maintainer scripts by dh_installdeb. See dh_installdeb(1) for an explanation of debhelper maintainer script
       snippets.

       If the directories found in the build tree have unusual owners, groups, or permissions, then those values
       will be preserved in the directories made by the postinst script. However, as a special exception, if a
       directory is owned by root.root, it will be treated as if it is owned by root.staff and is mode 2775. This is
       useful, since that is the group and mode policy recommends for directories in /usr/local.

OPTIONS
       -n, --noscripts
           Do not modify postinst/prerm scripts.

NOTES
       Note that this command is not idempotent. dh_prep(1) should be called between invocations of this command.
       Otherwise, it may cause multiple instances of the same text to be added to maintainer scripts.

CONFORMS TO
       Debian policy, version 2.2
