NAME
       dpkg-query - a tool to query the dpkg database

SYNOPSIS
       dpkg-query [option...] command

DESCRIPTION
       dpkg-query is a tool to show information about packages listed in the dpkg database.

COMMANDS
       -l, --list [package-name-pattern...]
              List  packages  matching  given  pattern.  If  no  package-name-pattern is given, list all packages in
              /var/lib/dpkg/status, excluding the ones marked as not-installed (i.e. those which  have  been  previ‐
              ously purged). Normal shell wildchars are allowed in package-name-pattern. Please note you will proba‐
              bly have to quote package-name-pattern to prevent the shell from performing  filename  expansion.  For
              example this will list all package names starting with “libc6”:

                dpkg-query -l 'libc6*'

              The first three columns of the output show the desired action, the package status, and errors, in that
              order.

              Desired action:
                u = Unknown
                i = Install
                h = Hold
                r = Remove
                p = Purge

              Package status:
                n = Not-installed
                c = Config-files
                H = Half-installed
                U = Unpacked
                F = Half-configured
                W = Triggers-awaiting
                t = Triggers-pending
                i = Installed

              Error flags:
                <empty> = (none)
                R = Reinst-required

              An uppercase status or error letter indicates the package is likely to cause severe  problems.  Please
              refer to dpkg(1) for information about the above states and flags.

              The  output  format  of  this option is not configurable, but varies automatically to fit the terminal
              width. It is intended for human readers, and is not  easily  machine-readable.  See  -W  (--show)  and
              --showformat for a way to configure the output format.

       -W, --show [package-name-pattern...]
              Just like the --list option this will list all packages matching the given pattern. However the output
              can be customized using the --showformat option.  The default output format gives one line per  match‐
              ing  package,  each line having the name (extended with the architecture qualifier for Multi-Arch same
              packages) and installed version of the package, separated by a tab.

       -s, --status package-name...
              Report status of specified package. This just displays the entry in the installed package status data‐
              base.  When  multiple  package-name are listed, the requested status entries are separated by an empty
              line, with the same order as specified on the argument list.

       -L, --listfiles package-name...
              List files installed to your system from package-name. When  multiple  package-name  are  listed,  the
              requested lists of files are separated by an empty line, with the same order as specified on the argu‐
              ment list.  However, note that files created by package-specific installation-scripts are not listed.

       --control-list package-name
              List control files installed to your system from package-name.  These can be used as  input  arguments
              to --control-show.

       --control-show package-name control-file
              Print the control-file installed to your system from package-name to the standard output.

       -c, --control-path package-name [control-file]
              List paths for control files installed to your system from package-name.  If control-file is specified
              then only list the path for that control file if it is present. Warning: this command  is  deprecated,
              please switch to use --control-list and --control-show instead.

       -S, --search filename-search-pattern...
              Search  for  packages that own files corresponding to the given pattern.  Standard shell wildchars can
              be used in the pattern.  This command will not list extra files created  by  maintainer  scripts,  nor
              will it list alternatives.

       -p, --print-avail package-name...
              Display  details  about  package-name, as found in /var/lib/dpkg/available. When multiple package-name
              are listed, the requested available entries are separated by an empty line, with  the  same  order  as
              specified on the argument list.

              Users  of  APT-based frontends should use apt-cache show package-name instead as the available file is
              only kept up-to-date when using dselect.

       -?, --help
              Show the usage message and exit.

       --version
              Show the version and exit.

OPTIONS
       --admindir=dir
              Change the location of the dpkg database. The default location is /var/lib/dpkg.

       --load-avail
              Also load the available file when using the --show and --list commands,  which  now  default  to  only
              querying the status file.

       -f, --showformat=format
              This  option  is  used to specify the format of the output --show will produce. The format is a string
              that will be output for each package listed.

              In the format string, “\” introduces escapes:

                  \n  newline
                  \r  carriage return
                  \t  tab

              “\” before any other character suppresses any special meaning of the  following  character,  which  is
              useful for “\” and “$”.

              Package  information can be included by inserting variable references to package fields using the syn‐
              tax “${field[;width]}”. Fields are printed right-aligned unless the width is negative  in  which  case
              left  alignment  will be used. The following fields are recognized but they are not necessarily avail‐
              able in the status file (only internal fields or fields stored in the binary package end up in it):

                  Architecture
                  Bugs
                  Conffiles (internal)
                  Config-Version (internal)
                  Conflicts
                  Breaks
                  Depends
                  Description
                  Enhances
                  Essential
                  Filename (internal, front-end related)
                  Homepage
                  Installed-Size
                  MD5sum (internal, front-end related)
                  MSDOS-Filename (internal, front-end related)
                  Maintainer
                  Origin
                  Package
                  Pre-Depends
                  Priority
                  Provides
                  Recommends
                  Replaces
                  Revision (obsolete)
                  Section
                  Size (internal, front-end related)
                  Source
                  Status (internal)
                  Suggests
                  Tag (usually not in .deb but in repository Packages files)
                  Triggers-Awaited (internal)
                  Triggers-Pending (internal)
                  Version

              The following are virtual fields, generated by dpkg-query from values from  other  fields  (note  that
              these do not use valid names for fields in control files):

                  binary:Package
                  binary:Summary
                  db:Status-Abbrev
                  source:Package
                  source:Version

              The  default  format string is “${binary:Package}\t${Version}\n”.  Actually, all other fields found in
              the status file (i.e. user defined fields) can be requested, too. They will be printed as-is,  though,
              no  conversion  nor  error checking is done on them. binary:Package is a special field that will print
              the package name with an architecture qualifier (like "libc6:amd64") if the package has  a  Multi-Arch
              field  with  a  value  of  same, and as such its name could be ambiguous.  To get the name of the dpkg
              maintainer and the installed version, you could run:

                dpkg-query -W -f='${binary:Package} ${Version}\t${Maintainer}\n' dpkg

EXIT STATUS
       0      The requested query was successfully performed.

       1      Problems were encountered while parsing the command line or performing the query, including no file or
              package being found (except for --control-path).

ENVIRONMENT
       DPKG_ADMINDIR
              If set and the --admindir option has not been specified, it will be used as the dpkg data directory.

       COLUMNS
              This setting influences the output of the --list option by changing the width of its output.
