XSUBPP(1)                                 Perl Programmers Reference Guide                                 XSUBPP(1)



NAME
       xsubpp - compiler to convert Perl XS code into C code

SYNOPSIS
       xsubpp [-v] [-except] [-s pattern] [-prototypes] [-noversioncheck] [-nolinenumbers] [-nooptimize] [-typemap
       typemap] [-output filename]... file.xs

DESCRIPTION
       This compiler is typically run by the makefiles created by ExtUtils::MakeMaker or by Module::Build or other
       Perl module build tools.

       xsubpp will compile XS code into C code by embedding the constructs necessary to let C functions manipulate
       Perl values and creates the glue necessary to let Perl access those functions.  The compiler uses typemaps to
       determine how to map C function parameters and variables to Perl values.

       The compiler will search for typemap files called typemap.  It will use the following search path to find
       default typemaps, with the rightmost typemap taking precedence.

               ../../../typemap:../../typemap:../typemap:typemap

       It will also use a default typemap installed as "ExtUtils::typemap".

OPTIONS
       Note that the "XSOPT" MakeMaker option may be used to add these options to any makefiles generated by
       MakeMaker.

       -hiertype
            Retains '::' in type names so that C++ hierarchical types can be mapped.

       -except
            Adds exception handling stubs to the C code.

       -typemap typemap
            Indicates that a user-supplied typemap should take precedence over the default typemaps.  This option
            may be used multiple times, with the last typemap having the highest precedence.

       -output filename
            Specifies the name of the output file to generate.  If no file is specified, output will be written to
            standard output.

       -v   Prints the xsubpp version number to standard output, then exits.

       -prototypes
            By default xsubpp will not automatically generate prototype code for all xsubs. This flag will enable
            prototypes.

       -noversioncheck
            Disables the run time test that determines if the object file (derived from the ".xs" file) and the
            ".pm" files have the same version number.

       -nolinenumbers
            Prevents the inclusion of '#line' directives in the output.

       -nooptimize
            Disables certain optimizations.  The only optimization that is currently affected is the use of targets
            by the output C code (see perlguts).  This may significantly slow down the generated code, but this is
            the way xsubpp of 5.005 and earlier operated.

       -noinout
            Disable recognition of "IN", "OUT_LIST" and "INOUT_LIST" declarations.

       -noargtypes
            Disable recognition of ANSI-like descriptions of function signature.

       -C++ Currently doesn't do anything at all.  This flag has been a no-op for many versions of perl, at least as
            far back as perl5.003_07.  It's allowed here for backwards compatibility.

ENVIRONMENT
       No environment variables are used.
