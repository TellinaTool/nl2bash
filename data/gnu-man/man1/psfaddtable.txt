NAME
       psfaddtable - add a Unicode character table to a console font

SYNOPSIS
       psfaddtable fontfile tablefile outfile

DESCRIPTION
       psfaddtable  takes  a  console font in .psf format given by fontfile and merges it with the Unicode character
       table given by tablefile to produce a font file with an embedded character table, which is  written  to  out‐
       file.  An input file name of "-" denotes standard input, and an output file name of "-" denotes standard out‐
       put.  If the fontfile already contains an embedded character table, it is ignored.

TABLE FILE FORMAT
       Each line in the tablefile should be either blank, contain a comment (preceded by #), or contain  a  sequence
       of  numbers in either decimal (default), octal (preceded by 0), or hexadecimal (preceded by 0x) format, sepa‐
       rated by spaces or tabs.  The first number on each line indicates the glyph slot in the font  that  is  being
       referred  to,  this  is between 0 and 0xff for a 256-character font and 0 and 0x1ff for a 512-character font.
       Any subsequent numbers on the same line are Unicodes matched by this specific glyph slot.  Instead of a  sin‐
       gle  Unicode  one  may  have a sequence of Unicodes separates by commas, to denote that the glyph depicts the
       corresponding composed symbol.  It is permissible to have multiple lines for the same glyph.
