NAME
       texdirflatten - Collects all components of a (La)TeX file in a single output directory -- i.e., flattens its
       hierarchy.

SYNOPSIS
       texdirflatten -f input.tex [-o outputdir]

DESCRIPTION
       It parses the source file, following its included children (La)TeX files recursively, to collect together its
       components, such as graphics and BiBTeX bibliography files in different directories.

OPTIONS
       -f input.tex
           Specifies input (La)TeX file.

       -o outputdir
           Directory to collect all files. texdirflatten will copy each source file, graphics and bibliography file
           to this directory. It will be created if it is unexistent. If unspecified, it defaults to "flat/".

EXAMPLES
       The following example scans "manuscript.tex" in the current directory and gathers it and all its components
       in the "submit_01/" directory:

        $ texdirflatten -f manuscript.tex -o submit_01
