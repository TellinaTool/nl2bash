NAME
       padsp - PulseAudio OSS Wrapper

SYNOPSIS
       padsp [options] PROGRAM [ARGUMENTS ...]

       padsp -h

DESCRIPTION
       padsp  starts  the  specified  program and redirects its access to OSS compatible audio devices (/dev/dsp and
       auxiliary devices) to a PulseAudio sound server.

       padsp uses the $LD_PRELOAD environment variable that is interpreted by ld.so(8) and thus does  not  work  for
       SUID binaries and statically built executables.

       Equivalent to using padsp is starting an application with $LD_PRELOAD set to libpulsedsp.so
