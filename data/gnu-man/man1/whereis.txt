WHEREIS(1)                                          User Commands                                         WHEREIS(1)



NAME
       whereis - locate the binary, source, and manual page files for a command

SYNOPSIS
       whereis [-bmsu] [-BMS directory...  -f] filename...

DESCRIPTION
       whereis  locates  source/binary  and  manuals  sections  for  specified  files.  The supplied names are first
       stripped of leading pathname components and any (single) trailing extension of the form  .ext,  for  example,
       .c.  Prefixes of s.  resulting from use of source code control are also dealt with.  whereis then attempts to
       locate the desired program in a list of standard Linux places.

OPTIONS
       -b     Search only for binaries.

       -m     Search only for manual sections.

       -s     Search only for sources.

       -u     Search for unusual entries.  A file is said to be unusual if it  does  not  have  one  entry  of  each
              requested type.  Thus `whereis  -m  -u  *' asks for those files in the current directory which have no
              documentation.

       -B     Change or otherwise limit the places where whereis searches for binaries.

       -M     Change or otherwise limit the places where whereis searches for manual sections.

       -S     Change or otherwise limit the places where whereis searches for sources.

       -f     Terminate the last directory list and signals the start of file names, and must be used  when  any  of
              the -B, -M, or -S options are used.

EXAMPLE
       Find all files in /usr/bin which are not documented in /usr/man/man1 with source in /usr/src:

              example% cd /usr/bin
              example% whereis -u -M /usr/man/man1 -S /usr/src -f *

FILES
       /{bin,sbin,etc}

       /usr/{lib,bin,old,new,local,games,include,etc,src,man,sbin,
                           X386,TeX,g++-include}

       /usr/local/{X386,TeX,X11,include,lib,man,etc,bin,games,emacs}

SEE ALSO
       chdir(2V)

BUGS
       Since  whereis  uses  chdir(2V)  to run faster, pathnames given with the -M, -S, or -B must be full; that is,
       they must begin with a `/'.

       whereis has a hard-coded path, so may not always find what you're looking for.

AVAILABILITY
       The  whereis  command  is  part  of  the  util-linux   package   and   is   available   from   ftp://ftp.ker‐
       nel.org/pub/linux/utils/util-linux/.
