XFONTSEL(1)                                    General Commands Manual                                   XFONTSEL(1)



NAME
       xfontsel - point and click selection of X11 font names

SYNTAX
       xfontsel  [-toolkitoption  ...]   [-pattern  fontname] [-print] [-sample text] [-sample16 text16] [-sampleUCS
       textUCS] [-scaled]

DESCRIPTION
       The xfontsel application provides a simple way to display the fonts known to your X server,  examine  samples
       of each, and retrieve the X Logical Font Description ("XLFD") full name for a font.

       If -pattern is not specified, all fonts with XLFD 14-part names will be selectable.  To work with only a sub‐
       set of the fonts, specify -pattern followed by a partially or fully qualified  font  name;  e.g.,  ``-pattern
       *medium*'' will select that subset of fonts which contain the string ``medium'' somewhere in their font name.
       Be careful about escaping wildcard characters in your shell.

       If -print is specified on the command line the selected font specifier will be  written  to  standard  output
       when the quit button is activated.  Regardless of whether or not -print was specified, the font specifier may
       be made the PRIMARY (text) selection by activating the select button.

       The -sample option specifies the sample text to be used to display the selected font if the font is  linearly
       indexed, overriding the default.

       The  -sample16 option specifies the sample text to be used to display the selected font if the font is matrix
       encoded, overriding the default.

       The -sampleUCS option specifies the sample text encoded in the UTF-8 form to be used to display the  selected
       font if the font has a CHARSET_REGISTRY of ISO10646, overriding the default.

       The -scaled option enables the ability to select scaled fonts at arbitrary pixel or point sizes.

INTERACTIONS
       Clicking  any  pointer button in one of the XLFD field names will pop up a menu of the currently-known possi‐
       bilities for that field.  If previous choices of other fields were made, only values for fonts which  matched
       the  previously  selected  fields will be selectable; to make other values selectable, you must deselect some
       other field(s) by choosing the ``*'' entry in that field.  Unselectable values may be omitted from  the  menu
       entirely as a configuration option; see the ShowUnselectable resource, below.  Whenever any change is made to
       a field value, xfontsel will assert ownership of the PRIMARY_FONT selection.  Other applications (see,  e.g.,
       xterm) may then retrieve the selected font specification.

       Scalable  fonts come back from the server with zero for the pixel size, point size, and average width fields.
       Selecting a font name with a zero in these positions results in an implementation-dependent size.  Any  pixel
       or  point  size can be selected to scale the font to a particular size.  Any average width can be selected to
       anamorphically scale the font (although you may find this challenging given the size  of  the  average  width
       menu).

       Clicking  the  left pointer button in the select widget will cause the currently selected font name to become
       the PRIMARY text selection as well as the PRIMARY_FONT selection.  This then allows you to paste  the  string
       into other applications.  The select button remains highlighted to remind you of this fact, and de-highlights
       when some other application takes the PRIMARY selection away.  The select widget is  a  toggle;  pressing  it
       when  it  is  highlighted will cause xfontsel to release the selection ownership and de-highlight the widget.
       Activating the select widget twice is the only way to cause xfontsel to release the PRIMARY_FONT selection.

RESOURCES
       The application class is XFontSel.  Most of the user-interface is configured in  the  app-defaults  file;  if
       this  file  is  missing a warning message will be printed to standard output and the resulting window will be
       nearly incomprehensible.

       Most of the significant parts of the widget hierarchy are documented in /etc/X11/app-defaults/XFontSel,

       Application specific resources:

       cursor (class Cursor)
               Specifies the cursor for the application window.

       pattern (class Pattern)
               Specifies the font name pattern for selecting a subset of available fonts.  Equivalent to  the  -pat‐
               tern  option.   Most  useful  patterns  will contain at least one field delimiter; e.g. ``*-m-*'' for
               monospaced fonts.

       pixelSizeList (class PixelSizeList)
               Specifies a list of pixel sizes to add to the pixel size menu, so that scalable fonts can be selected
               at those pixel sizes.  The default pixelSizeList contains 7, 30, 40, 50, and 60.

       pointSizeList (class PointSizeList)
               Specifies a list of point sizes (in units of tenths of points) to add to the point size menu, so that
               scalable fonts can be selected at those point sizes.  The default pointSizeList  contains  250,  300,
               350, and 400.

       printOnQuit (class PrintOnQuit)
               If  True the currently selected font name is printed to standard output when the quit button is acti‐
               vated.  Equivalent to the -print option.

       sampleText (class Text)
               The sample 1-byte text to use for linearly indexed fonts.  Each glyph index is a  single  byte,  with
               newline separating lines.

       sampleText16 (class Text16)
               The sample 2-byte text to use for matrix-encoded fonts.  Each glyph index is two bytes, with a 1-byte
               newline separating lines.

       scaledFonts (class ScaledFonts)
               If True then selection of arbitrary pixel and point sizes for scalable fonts is enabled.

       Widget specific resources:

       showUnselectable (class ShowUnselectable)
               Specifies, for each field menu, whether or not to show values  that  are  not  currently  selectable,
               based  upon  previous  field selections.  If shown, the unselectable values are clearly identified as
               such and do not highlight when the pointer is moved down the menu.  The full name of this resource is
               fieldN.menu.options.showUnselectable,  class  MenuButton.SimpleMenu.Options.ShowUnselectable; where N
               is replaced with the field number (starting with the left-most field numbered  0).   The  default  is
               True for all but field 11 (average width of characters in font) and False for field 11.  If you never
               want to see unselectable entries, '*menu.options.showUnselectable:False' is  a  reasonable  thing  to
               specify in a resource file.

BUGS
       Sufficiently  ambiguous  patterns can be misinterpreted and lead to an initial selection string which may not
       correspond to what the user intended and which may cause the initial sample text output to fail to match  the
       proffered string.  Selecting any new field value will correct the sample output, though possibly resulting in
       no matching font.

       Should be able to return a FONT for the PRIMARY selection, not just a STRING.

       Any change in a field value will cause xfontsel to assert ownership of the PRIMARY_FONT  selection.   Perhaps
       this should be parameterized.

       When  running  on  a  slow machine, it is possible for the user to request a field menu before the font names
       have been completely parsed.  An error message indicating a missing menu is printed to stderr  but  otherwise
       nothing bad (or good) happens.

       The average-width menu is too large to be useful.
