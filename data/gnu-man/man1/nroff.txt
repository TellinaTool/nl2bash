NAME
       nroff - emulate nroff command with groff

SYNOPSIS
       nroff [-CchipStUvwW] [-dcs] [-Mdir] [-mname] [-nnum] [-olist] [-rcn] [-Tname] [file ...]
       nroff --help
       nroff -v | --version

DESCRIPTION
       The  nroff  script  emulates the nroff command using groff.  Only ascii, latin1, utf8, and cp1047 are devices
       accepted by nroff to select the output encoding emitted by grotty, groff's TTY output device.  If neither the
       GROFF_TYPESETTER  environment  variable nor the -T command line option (which overrides the environment vari‐
       able) specifies a (valid) device, nroff checks the current locale to select  a  default  output  device.   It
       first  tries  the  locale program, then the environment variables LC_ALL, LC_CTYPE, and LANG, and finally the
       LESSCHARSET environment variable.

       The -h and -c options are equivalent to grotty's options -h (using tabs in the output) and -c (using the  old
       output  scheme instead of SGR escape sequences).  The -d, -C, -i, -M, -m, -n, -o, -r, -w, and -W options have
       the effect described in troff(1).  In addition, nroff silently ignores the options -e, -q, and -s (which  are
       not  implemented in troff).  Options -p (pic), -t (tbl), -S (safer), and -U (unsafe) are passed to groff.  -v
       and --version show the version number, --help prints a help message.

ENVIRONMENT
       GROFF_TYPESETTER
              The default device for groff.  If not set (which is the normal case), it defaults to `ps'.

       GROFF_BIN_PATH
              A colon separated list of directories in which to search for the groff executable before searching  in
              PATH.  If unset, `/usr/bin' is used.

NOTES
       This  shell script is basically intended for use with man(1).  nroff-style character definitions (in the file
       tty-char.tmac) are also loaded to emulate unrepresentable glyphs.
