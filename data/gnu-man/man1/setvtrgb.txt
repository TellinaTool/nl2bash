SETVTRGB(1)                                    General Commands Manual                                   SETVTRGB(1)



NAME
       setvtrgb - customize the console color map

SYNOPSIS
       setvtrgb vga

       setvtrgb FILE|-

DESCRIPTION
       setvtrgb  sets  the console color map in all virtual terminals according to custom values specified in a file
       or standard input.  With the `vga' parameter, it can also be used to restore the settings built into the ker‐
       nel.

       When invoked with a filename or `-', setvtrgb expects input as follows:

         color0_r,color1_r,...,color15_r
         color0_g,color1_g,...,color15_g
         color0_b,color1_b,...,color15_b

       where  colorN_{r,g,b} is the red/green/blue portion of the respective color in decimal notation in the 0..255
       range.  To pre-seed a file in the correct format, you can use

         cat /sys/module/vt/parameters/default_{red,grn,blu}

       The meanings of the color values are defined as follows:

         +--------+--------+---------+
         | Normal | Bright | Color   |
         +--------+--------+---------+
         |      0 |      8 | Black   |
         |      1 |      9 | Red     |
         |      2 |     10 | Green   |
         |      3 |     11 | Yellow  |
         |      4 |     12 | Blue    |
         |      5 |     13 | Magenta |
         |      6 |     14 | Cyan    |
         |      7 |     15 | White   |
