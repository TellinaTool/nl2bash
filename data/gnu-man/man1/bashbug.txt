NAME
       bashbug - report a bug in bash

SYNOPSIS
       bashbug [--help] [--version] [bug-report-email-addresses]

DESCRIPTION
       bashbug is a utility for reporting bugs in Bash to the maintainers.

       bashbug will start up your preferred editor with a preformatted bug report template for you to fill in. Save
       the file and quit the editor once you have completed the missing fields.  bashbug will notify you of any
       problems with the report and ask for confirmation before sending it. By default the bug report is mailed to
       both the GNU developers and the Debian Bash maintainers. The recipients can be changed by giving a comma
       separated list of bug-report-email-addresses.

       If you invoke bashbug by accident, just quit your editor. You will always be asked for confirmation before a
       bug report is sent.
