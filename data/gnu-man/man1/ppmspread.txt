NAME
       ppmspread - displace a portable pixmap's pixels by a random amount

SYNOPSIS
       ppmspread amount [ppmfile]

DESCRIPTION
       Reads  a  portable  pixmap as input. Moves every pixel around a bit relative to its original position. amount
       determines by how many pixels a pixel is to be moved around at most.

       Pictures processed with this filter will seem to be somewhat dissolved or unfocussed  (although  they  appear
       more coarse than images processed by something like pnmconvol ).

SEE ALSO
       ppm(5), pnmconvol(1)
