gtkdoc-mktmpl(1)                               General Commands Manual                              gtkdoc-mktmpl(1)



NAME
       gtkdoc-mktmpl —  GTK DocBook documentation generator.

SYNOPSIS
       gtkdoc-mktmpl [ See below ]

DESCRIPTION
       gtkdoc-mktmpl  This creates or updates the template files which contain the manually-edited documentation. (A
       template is a simple text form which is filled in with the description of a function, macro, enum, or struct.
       For functions and macros it also contains fields for describing the parameters.)

       This  script reads in the existing templates, found in tmpl/*.sgml, moves these files to tmpl/*.sgml.bak, and
       then recreates the .sgml files according to the structure given in the file MODULE-sections.txt.

       Any new templates added, or new function parameters, are marked with FIXME so you can do a grep to see  which
       parts need updating.

       Any templates which are no longer used (i.e. they are remove from MODULE-sections.txt) are placed in the file
       tmpl/MODULE-unused.txt. If they are included again later they are automatically copied  back  into  position.
       If you are certain that these templates will never be used again you can delete them from MODULE-unused.txt.

       Any  parameters  to functions which are no longer used are separated from the rest of the parameters with the
       line <!-- # Unused Parameters # -->. It may be that the parameter name has just been changed, in  which  case
       you can copy the description to the parameter with the new name. You can delete the unused parameter descrip‐
       tions when no longer needed.

EXAMPLE
       See /usr/share/doc/gtk-doc-tools/examples, for a makefile.am and a configure.in example file.
