NAME
       ppmquant - quantize the colors in a portable pixmap down to a specified number

SYNOPSIS
       ppmquant [-floyd|-fs] ncolors [ppmfile]
       ppmquant [-floyd|-fs] [-nofloyd|-nofs] -mapfile mapfile [ppmfile]

       All  options  can  be abbreviated to their shortest unique prefix.  You may use two hyphens instead of one to
       designate an option.  You may use either white space or equals signs between an option name and its value.


DESCRIPTION
       pnmquant is a newer, more general program that is backward compatible with ppmquant.  ppmquant may be faster,
       though.

       Reads  a PPM image as input.  Chooses ncolors colors to best represent the image, maps the existing colors to
       the new ones, and writes a PPM image as output.

       The quantization method is Heckbert's "median cut".

       Alternately, you can skip the color-choosing step by specifying your own set  of  colors  with  the  -mapfile
       option.   The  mapfile  is  just  a ppm file; it can be any shape, all that matters is the colors in it.  For
       instance, to quantize down to the 8-color IBM TTL color set, you might use:
           P3
           8 1
           255
             0   0   0
           255   0   0
             0 255   0
             0   0 255
           255 255   0
           255   0 255
             0 255 255
           255 255 255
       If you want to quantize one image to use the colors in another one, just use the second one as  the  mapfile.
       You don't have to reduce it down to only one pixel of each color, just use it as is.

       If  you  use a mapfile, the output image has the same maxval as the mapfile.  Otherwise, the output maxval is
       the same as the input maxval, or less in some cases where the quantization process reduces the necessary res‐
       olution.


       The  -floyd/-fs  option  enables a Floyd-Steinberg error diffusion step.  Floyd-Steinberg gives vastly better
       results on images where the unmodified quantization has banding or other artifacts, especially when going  to
       a  small  number  of colors such as the above IBM set.  However, it does take substantially more CPU time, so
       the default is off.

       -nofloyd/-nofs means not to use the Floyd-Steinberg error diffusion.  This is the default.
