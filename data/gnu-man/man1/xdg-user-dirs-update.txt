NAME
       xdg-user-dirs-update - Update XDG user dir configuration

SYNOPSIS
       xdg-user-dirs-update [OPTION...] [--set NAME PATH...]

DESCRIPTION
       xdg-user-dirs-update updates the current state of the users user-dirs.dir. If none existed before then one is
       created based on the system default values, or falling back to the old non-translated filenames if such
       directories exists. The list of old directories used are: ~/Desktop, ~/Templates and ~/Public.

       If an old configuration exists it is updated with any new default directories. Additionally, any configured
       directories that point to non-existing locations are reset by pointing then to the users home directory. This
       typically happens when the users removed the directory, so they likely don't want to use it anymore.

       On the first run a user-dirs.locale file is created containing the locale that was used for the translation.
       This is used later by gui tools like xdg-user-dirs-gtk-update to detect if the locale was changed, letting
       you to migrate from the old names.

       xdg-user-dirs-update is normally run automatically at the start of a user session to update the XDG user dirs
       according to the users locale.

OPTIONS
       The following options are understood:

       --help
           Print help output and exit.

       --force
           Update existing user-dirs.dir, but force a full reset. This means: Don't reset nonexisting directories to
           HOME, rather recreate the directory. Never use backwards compatible non-translated names. Always recreate
           user-dirs.locale.

       --dummy-output PATH
           Write the configuration to PATH instead of the default configuration file. Also, no directories are
           created.

       --set NAME PATH
           Sets the XDG user dir with the given name.

           NAME should be one of the following:
               DESKTOP
               DOWNLOAD
               TEMPLATES
               PUBLICSHARE
               DOCUMENTS
               MUSIC
               PICTURES
               VIDEOS

           PATH must be an absolute path, e.g.  $HOME/Some/Directory.

FILES
       The XDG user dirs configuration is stored in the user-dirs.dir file in the location pointed to by the
       XDG_CONFIG_HOME environment variable.

ENVIRONMENT
       The XDG_CONFIG_HOME environment variable determines where the user-dirs.dirs file is located.
