DESCRIPTION
       man  is the system's manual pager. Each page argument given to man is normally the name of a program, utility
       or function.  The manual page associated with each of these arguments is then found and displayed. A section,
       if  provided, will direct man to look only in that section of the manual.  The default action is to search in
       all of the available sections following a pre-defined order ("1 n l 8 3 2 3posix 3pm 3perl 5  4  9  6  7"  by
       default,  unless overridden by the SECTION directive in /etc/manpath.config), and to show only the first page
       found, even if page exists in several sections.

       The table below shows the section numbers of the manual followed by the types of pages they contain.


       1   Executable programs or shell commands
       2   System calls (functions provided by the kernel)
       3   Library calls (functions within program libraries)
       4   Special files (usually found in /dev)
       5   File formats and conventions eg /etc/passwd
       6   Games
       7   Miscellaneous (including macro packages and conventions), e.g. man(7), groff(7)
       8   System administration commands (usually only for root)
       9   Kernel routines [Non standard]

       A manual page consists of several sections.

       Conventional  section  names  include  NAME,  SYNOPSIS,  CONFIGURATION,  DESCRIPTION,  OPTIONS,  EXIT STATUS,
       RETURN VALUE,  ERRORS,  ENVIRONMENT,  FILES,  VERSIONS,  CONFORMING TO,  NOTES,  BUGS,  EXAMPLE, AUTHORS, and
       SEE ALSO.

       The following conventions apply to the SYNOPSIS section and can be used as a guide in other sections.


       bold text          type exactly as shown.
       italic text        replace with appropriate argument.
       [-abc]             any or all arguments within [ ] are optional.
       -a|-b              options delimited by | cannot be used together.
       argument ...       argument is repeatable.
       [expression] ...   entire expression within [ ] is repeatable.

       Exact rendering may vary depending on the output device.  For instance, man will usually not be able to  ren‐
       der italics when running in a terminal, and will typically use underlined or coloured text instead.

       The  command or function illustration is a pattern that should match all possible invocations.  In some cases
       it is advisable to illustrate several exclusive invocations as is shown in the SYNOPSIS section of this  man‐
       ual page.

EXAMPLES
       man ls
           Display the manual page for the item (program) ls.

       man -a intro
           Display,  in succession, all of the available intro manual pages contained within the manual.  It is pos‐
           sible to quit between successive displays or skip any of them.

       man -t alias | lpr -Pps
           Format the manual page referenced by `alias', usually a shell manual page,  into  the  default  troff  or
           groff  format  and  pipe it to the printer named ps.  The default output for groff is usually PostScript.
           man --help should advise as to which processor is bound to the -t option.

       man -l -Tdvi ./foo.1x.gz > ./foo.1x.dvi
           This command will decompress and format the nroff source manual page ./foo.1x.gz into a  device  indepen‐
           dent (dvi) file.  The redirection is necessary as the -T flag causes output to be directed to stdout with
           no pager.  The output could be viewed with a program such as xdvi or further  processed  into  PostScript
           using a program such as dvips.

       man -k printf
           Search  the short descriptions and manual page names for the keyword printf as regular expression.  Print
           out any matches.  Equivalent to apropos -r printf.

       man -f smail
           Lookup the manual pages referenced by smail and print out the short descriptions of any  found.   Equiva‐
           lent to whatis -r smail.

OVERVIEW
       Many  options are available to man in order to give as much flexibility as possible to the user.  Changes can
       be made to the search path, section order, output processor, and other  behaviours  and  operations  detailed
       below.

       If  set, various environment variables are interrogated to determine the operation of man.  It is possible to
       set the `catch all' variable $MANOPT to any string in command line format with the exception that any  spaces
       used as part of an option's argument must be escaped (preceded by a backslash).  man will parse $MANOPT prior
       to parsing its own command line.  Those options requiring an argument will be overridden by the same  options
       found  on  the  command line.  To reset all of the options set in $MANOPT, -D can be specified as the initial
       command line option.  This will allow man to `forget' about the options specified in  $MANOPT  although  they
       must still have been valid.

       The manual pager utilities packaged as man-db make extensive use of index database caches.  These caches con‐
       tain information such as where each manual page can be found on the filesystem and what its whatis (short one
       line description of the man page) contains, and allow man to run faster than if it had to search the filesys‐
       tem each time to find the appropriate manual page.  If requested using the -u option, man  will  ensure  that
       the  caches  remain  consistent,  which  can  obviate the need to manually run software to update traditional
       whatis text databases.

       If man cannot find a mandb initiated index database for a particular manual page  hierarchy,  it  will  still
       search for the requested manual pages, although file globbing will be necessary to search within that hierar‐
       chy.  If whatis or apropos fails to find an index it will try  to  extract  information  from  a  traditional
       whatis database instead.

       These  utilities  support compressed source nroff files having, by default, the extensions of .Z, .z and .gz.
       It is possible to deal with any compression extension, but this information must be known  at  compile  time.
       Also, by default, any cat pages produced are compressed using gzip.  Each `global' manual page hierarchy such
       as /usr/share/man or /usr/X11R6/man may have any directory as its cat page hierarchy.  Traditionally the  cat
       pages  are  stored  under the same hierarchy as the man pages, but for reasons such as those specified in the
       File Hierarchy Standard (FHS), it may be better to store them elsewhere.  For details  on  how  to  do  this,
       please read manpath(5).  For details on why to do this, read the standard.

       International support is available with this package.  Native language manual pages are accessible (if avail‐
       able on your system) via use of locale functions.  To activate such support, it is necessary  to  set  either
       $LC_MESSAGES,  $LANG or another system dependent environment variable to your language locale, usually speci‐
       fied in the POSIX 1003.1 based format:

       <language>[_<territory>[.<character-set>[,<version>]]]

       If the desired page is available in your locale, it will be displayed in lieu of the standard (usually Ameri‐
       can English) page.

       Support  for  international  message  catalogues is also featured in this package and can be activated in the
       same way, again if available.  If you find that the manual pages and message catalogues  supplied  with  this
       package are not available in your native language and you would like to supply them, please contact the main‐
       tainer who will be coordinating such activity.

       For information regarding other features and extensions available with this manual  pager,  please  read  the
       documents supplied with the package.

DEFAULTS
       man  will  search for the desired manual pages within the index database caches. If the -u option is given, a
       cache consistency check is performed to ensure the databases accurately  reflect  the  filesystem.   If  this
       option  is  always  given, it is not generally necessary to run mandb after the caches are initially created,
       unless a cache becomes corrupt.  However, the cache consistency check can be slow on systems with many manual
       pages  installed,  so  it  is not performed by default, and system administrators may wish to run mandb every
       week or so to keep the database caches fresh.  To forestall problems caused by outdated caches, man will fall
       back to file globbing if a cache lookup fails, just as it would if no cache was present.

       Once  a  manual page has been located, a check is performed to find out if a relative preformatted `cat' file
       already exists and is newer than the nroff file.  If it does and is,  this  preformatted  file  is  (usually)
       decompressed and then displayed, via use of a pager.  The pager can be specified in a number of ways, or else
       will fall back to a default is used (see option -P for details).  If no cat is found or  is  older  than  the
       nroff file, the nroff is filtered through various programs and is shown immediately.

       If  a  cat  file  can be produced (a relative cat directory exists and has appropriate permissions), man will
       compress and store the cat file in the background.

       The filters are deciphered by a number of means. Firstly, the command line option -p or the environment vari‐
       able  $MANROFFSEQ  is  interrogated. If -p was not used and the environment variable was not set, the initial
       line of the nroff file is parsed for a preprocessor string.  To contain  a  valid  preprocessor  string,  the
       first line must resemble

       '\" <string>

       where string can be any combination of letters described by option -p below.

       If none of the above methods provide any filter information, a default set is used.

       A  formatting  pipeline  is formed from the filters and the primary formatter (nroff or [tg]roff with -t) and
       executed.  Alternatively, if an executable program mandb_nfmt (or mandb_tfmt with -t) exists in the man  tree
       root, it is executed instead.  It gets passed the manual source file, the preprocessor string, and optionally
       the device specified with -T or -E as arguments.

OPTIONS
       Non argument options that are duplicated either on the command line, in $MANOPT, or both,  are  not  harmful.
       For options that require an argument, each duplication will override the previous argument value.

   General options
       -C file, --config-file=file
              Use this user configuration file rather than the default of ~/.manpath.

       -d, --debug
              Print debugging information.

       -D, --default
              This  option  is  normally  issued as the very first option and resets man's behaviour to its default.
              Its use is to reset those options that may have been set in $MANOPT.  Any options that follow -D  will
              have their usual effect.

       --warnings[=warnings]
              Enable  warnings  from  groff.  This may be used to perform sanity checks on the source text of manual
              pages.  warnings is a comma-separated list of warning names; if it is not  supplied,  the  default  is
              "mac".  See the “Warnings” node in info groff for a list of available warning names.

   Main modes of operation
       -f, --whatis
              Equivalent  to  whatis.  Display a short description from the manual page, if available. See whatis(1)
              for details.

       -k, --apropos
              Equivalent to apropos.  Search the short  manual  page  descriptions  for  keywords  and  display  any
              matches.  See apropos(1) for details.

       -K, --global-apropos
              Search  for  text in all manual pages.  This is a brute-force search, and is likely to take some time;
              if you can, you should specify a section to reduce the number of  pages  that  need  to  be  searched.
              Search  terms  may  be  simple  strings (the default), or regular expressions if the --regex option is
              used.

       -l, --local-file
              Activate `local' mode.  Format and display local manual files instead of searching  through  the  sys‐
              tem's manual collection.  Each manual page argument will be interpreted as an nroff source file in the
              correct format.  No cat file is produced.  If '-' is listed as one of the  arguments,  input  will  be
              taken  from stdin.  When this option is not used, and man fails to find the page required, before dis‐
              playing the error message, it attempts to act as if this option was supplied,  using  the  name  as  a
              filename and looking for an exact match.

       -w, --where, --path, --location
              Don't  actually  display the manual pages, but do print the location(s) of the source nroff files that
              would be formatted.

       -W, --where-cat, --location-cat
              Don't actually display the manual pages, but do print the location(s) of the cat files that  would  be
              displayed.  If -w and -W are both specified, print both separated by a space.

       -c, --catman
              This option is not for general use and should only be used by the catman program.

       -R encoding, --recode=encoding
              Instead  of  formatting the manual page in the usual way, output its source converted to the specified
              encoding.  If you already know the encoding of the source file, you can also use manconv(1)  directly.
              However, this option allows you to convert several manual pages to a single encoding without having to
              explicitly state the encoding of each, provided that they were already installed in a structure  simi‐
              lar to a manual page hierarchy.

   Finding manual pages
       -L locale, --locale=locale
              man  will normally determine your current locale by a call to the C function setlocale(3) which inter‐
              rogates various environment variables, possibly including  $LC_MESSAGES  and  $LANG.   To  temporarily
              override  the  determined value, use this option to supply a locale string directly to man.  Note that
              it will not take effect until the search for pages actually begins.  Output such as the  help  message
              will always be displayed in the initially determined locale.

       -m system[,...], --systems=system[,...]
              If  this  system  has access to other operating system's manual pages, they can be accessed using this
              option.  To search for a manual page from NewOS's manual page collection, use the option -m NewOS.

              The system specified can be a combination of comma delimited operating system  names.   To  include  a
              search  of  the  native  operating  system's manual pages, include the system name man in the argument
              string.  This option will override the $SYSTEM environment variable.

       -M path, --manpath=path
              Specify an alternate manpath to use.  By default, man uses manpath derived code to determine the  path
              to  search.   This  option  overrides  the  $MANPATH  environment  variable and causes option -m to be
              ignored.

              A path specified as a manpath must be the root of a manual page hierarchy structured into sections  as
              described  in  the  man-db manual (under "The manual page system").  To view manual pages outside such
              hierarchies, see the -l option.

       -S list, -s list, --sections=list
              List is a colon- or comma-separated list of `order specific' manual sections to search.   This  option
              overrides the $MANSECT environment variable.  (The -s spelling is for compatibility with System V.)

       -e sub-extension, --extension=sub-extension
              Some systems incorporate large packages of manual pages, such as those that accompany the Tcl package,
              into the main manual page hierarchy.  To get around the problem of having two manual  pages  with  the
              same  name such as exit(3), the Tcl pages were usually all assigned to section l.  As this is unfortu‐
              nate, it is now possible to put the pages in the correct section, and to assign a specific `extension'
              to  them, in this case, exit(3tcl).  Under normal operation, man will display exit(3) in preference to
              exit(3tcl).  To negotiate this situation and to avoid having  to  know  which  section  the  page  you
              require resides in, it is now possible to give man a sub-extension string indicating which package the
              page must belong to.  Using the above example, supplying the option -e tcl to man  will  restrict  the
              search to pages having an extension of *tcl.

       -i, --ignore-case
              Ignore case when searching for manual pages.  This is the default.

       -I, --match-case
              Search for manual pages case-sensitively.

       --regex
              Show  all  pages with any part of either their names or their descriptions matching each page argument
              as a regular expression, as with apropos(1).  Since there is usually  no  reasonable  way  to  pick  a
              "best" page when searching for a regular expression, this option implies -a.

       --wildcard
              Show  all  pages with any part of either their names or their descriptions matching each page argument
              using shell-style wildcards, as with apropos(1) --wildcard.  The page argument must match  the  entire
              name  or  description, or match on word boundaries in the description.  Since there is usually no rea‐
              sonable way to pick a "best" page when searching for a wildcard, this option implies -a.

       --names-only
              If the --regex or --wildcard option is used, match only page names, not  page  descriptions,  as  with
              whatis(1).  Otherwise, no effect.

       -a, --all
              By  default, man will exit after displaying the most suitable manual page it finds.  Using this option
              forces man to display all the manual pages with names that match the search criteria.

       -u, --update
              This option causes man to perform an `inode level' consistency check on its database caches to  ensure
              that  they are an accurate representation of the filesystem.  It will only have a useful effect if man
              is installed with the setuid bit set.

       --no-subpages
              By default, man will try to interpret pairs of manual page names given on the command line as  equiva‐
              lent to a single manual page name containing a hyphen or an underscore.  This supports the common pat‐
              tern of programs that implement a number of subcommands, allowing them to  provide  manual  pages  for
              each  that can be accessed using similar syntax as would be used to invoke the subcommands themselves.
              For example:

                $ man -aw git diff
                /usr/share/man/man1/git-diff.1.gz

              To disable this behaviour, use the --no-subpages option.

                $ man -aw --no-subpages git diff
                /usr/share/man/man1/git.1.gz
                /usr/share/man/man3/Git.3pm.gz
                /usr/share/man/man1/diff.1.gz

   Controlling formatted output
       -P pager, --pager=pager
              Specify which output pager to use.  By default, man uses pager -s.  This option  overrides  the  $MAN‐
              PAGER  environment  variable, which in turn overrides the $PAGER environment variable.  It is not used
              in conjunction with -f or -k.

              The value may be a simple command name or a command with arguments, and may use shell  quoting  (back‐
              slashes,  single quotes, or double quotes).  It may not use pipes to connect multiple commands; if you
              need that, use a wrapper script, which may take the file to display either as an argument or on  stan‐
              dard input.

       -r prompt, --prompt=prompt
              If a recent version of less is used as the pager, man will attempt to set its prompt and some sensible
              options.  The default prompt looks like

               Manual page name(sec) line x

              where name denotes the manual page name, sec denotes the section it was found under and x the  current
              line number.  This is achieved by using the $LESS environment variable.

              Supplying  -r with a string will override this default.  The string may contain the text $MAN_PN which
              will be expanded to the name of the current manual page and its section name  surrounded  by  `('  and
              `)'.  The string used to produce the default could be expressed as

              \ Manual\ page\ \$MAN_PN\ ?ltline\ %lt?L/%L.:
              byte\ %bB?s/%s..?\ (END):?pB\ %pB\\%..
              (press h for help or q to quit)

              It  is broken into three lines here for the sake of readability only.  For its meaning see the less(1)
              manual page.  The prompt string is first evaluated by the shell.  All double quotes,  back-quotes  and
              backslashes  in  the prompt must be escaped by a preceding backslash.  The prompt string may end in an
              escaped $ which may be followed by further options for less.  By default man sets the -ix8 options.

              The $MANLESS environment variable described below may be used to set a default prompt string  if  none
              is supplied on the command line.

       -7, --ascii
              When viewing a pure ascii(7) manual page on a 7 bit terminal or terminal emulator, some characters may
              not display correctly when using the latin1(7) device description with GNU nroff.  This option  allows
              pure  ascii  manual  pages to be displayed in ascii with the latin1 device.  It will not translate any
              latin1 text.  The following table shows the translations performed: some parts of it may only be  dis‐
              played properly when using GNU nroff's latin1(7) device.


              Description           Octal   latin1   ascii
              ─────────────────────────────────────────────
              continuation hyphen    255      ‐        -
              bullet (middle dot)    267      ·        o
              acute accent           264      ´        '
              multiplication sign    327      ×        x

              If  the  latin1  column displays correctly, your terminal may be set up for latin1 characters and this
              option is not necessary.  If the latin1 and ascii columns are identical, you  are  reading  this  page
              using  this option or man did not format this page using the latin1 device description.  If the latin1
              column is missing or corrupt, you may need to view manual pages with this option.

              This option is ignored when using options -t, -H, -T, or -Z and may be useless for  nroff  other  than
              GNU's.

       -E encoding, --encoding=encoding
              Generate output for a character encoding other than the default.  For backward compatibility, encoding
              may be an nroff device such as ascii, latin1, or utf8 as well as a true  character  encoding  such  as
              UTF-8.

       --no-hyphenation, --nh
              Normally,  nroff  will  automatically  hyphenate text at line breaks even in words that do not contain
              hyphens, if it is necessary to do so to lay out words on  a  line  without  excessive  spacing.   This
              option  disables  automatic  hyphenation,  so  words  will  only be hyphenated if they already contain
              hyphens.

              If you are writing a manual page and simply want to prevent nroff from hyphenating a word at an  inap‐
              propriate  point,  do  not use this option, but consult the nroff documentation instead; for instance,
              you can put "\%" inside a word to indicate that it may be hyphenated at that point, or put "\%" at the
              start of a word to prevent it from being hyphenated.

       --no-justification, --nj
              Normally, nroff will automatically justify text to both margins.  This option disables full justifica‐
              tion, leaving justified only to the left margin, sometimes called "ragged-right" text.

              If you are writing a manual page and simply want to prevent nroff from justifying certain  paragraphs,
              do  not  use  this  option, but consult the nroff documentation instead; for instance, you can use the
              ".na", ".nf", ".fi", and ".ad" requests to temporarily disable adjusting and filling.

       -p string, --preprocessor=string
              Specify the sequence of preprocessors to run before nroff or troff/groff.  Not all installations  will
              have  a  full  set of preprocessors.  Some of the preprocessors and the letters used to designate them
              are: eqn (e), grap (g), pic (p), tbl (t), vgrind (v), refer (r).  This option overrides the  $MANROFF‐
              SEQ environment variable.  zsoelim is always run as the very first preprocessor.

       -t, --troff
              Use  groff  -mandoc  to  format the manual page to stdout.  This option is not required in conjunction
              with -H, -T, or -Z.

       -T[device], --troff-device[=device]
              This option is used to change groff (or possibly troff's) output to be suitable  for  a  device  other
              than  the default.  It implies -t.  Examples (provided with Groff-1.17) include dvi, latin1, ps, utf8,
              X75 and X100.

       -H[browser], --html[=browser]
              This option will cause groff to produce HTML output, and will display that output in  a  web  browser.
              The  choice  of  browser  is  determined  by  the optional browser argument if one is provided, by the
              $BROWSER environment variable, or by a compile-time default if that is  unset  (usually  lynx).   This
              option implies -t, and will only work with GNU troff.

       -X[dpi], --gxditview[=dpi]
              This  option  displays the output of groff in a graphical window using the gxditview program.  The dpi
              (dots per inch) may be 75, 75-12, 100, or 100-12, defaulting to 75; the -12 variants  use  a  12-point
              base font.  This option implies -T with the X75, X75-12, X100, or X100-12 device respectively.

       -Z, --ditroff
              groff  will  run  troff  and then use an appropriate post-processor to produce output suitable for the
              chosen device.  If groff -mandoc is groff, this option is passed to groff and will suppress the use of
              a post-processor.  It implies -t.

   Getting help
       -?, --help

       --usage
              Print a short usage message and exit.

       -V, --version

EXIT STATUS
       0      Successful program execution.

       1      Usage, syntax or configuration file error.

       2      Operational error.

       3      A child process returned a non-zero exit status.

       16     At least one of the pages/files/keywords didn't exist or wasn't matched.

ENVIRONMENT
       MANPATH
              If $MANPATH is set, its value is used as the path to search for manual pages.

       MANROFFOPT
              The contents of $MANROFFOPT are added to the command line every time man invokes the formatter (nroff,
              troff, or groff).

       MANROFFSEQ
              If $MANROFFSEQ is set, its value is used to determine the set of preprocessors  to  pass  each  manual
              page through.  The default preprocessor list is system dependent.

       MANSECT
              If  $MANSECT is set, its value is a colon-delimited list of sections and it is used to determine which
              manual sections to search and in what order.  The default is "1 n l 8 3 2 3posix 3pm 3perl 5 4 9 6 7",
              unless overridden by the SECTION directive in /etc/manpath.config.

       MANPAGER, PAGER
              If  $MANPAGER or $PAGER is set ($MANPAGER is used in preference), its value is used as the name of the
              program used to display the manual page.  By default, pager -s is used.

              The value may be a simple command name or a command with arguments, and may use shell  quoting  (back‐
              slashes,  single quotes, or double quotes).  It may not use pipes to connect multiple commands; if you
              need that, use a wrapper script, which may take the file to display either as an argument or on  stan‐
              dard input.

       MANLESS
              If  $MANLESS  is set, its value will be used as the default prompt string for the less pager, as if it
              had been passed using the -r option (so any occurrences of the text $MAN_PN will be  expanded  in  the
              same  way).   For example, if you want to set the prompt string unconditionally to “my prompt string”,
              set $MANLESS to ‘-Psmy prompt string’.  Using the -r option overrides this environment variable.

       BROWSER
              If $BROWSER is set, its value is a colon-delimited list of commands, each of which in turn is used  to
              try  to  start a web browser for man --html.  In each command, %s is replaced by a filename containing
              the HTML output from groff, %% is replaced by a single percent sign (%), and %c is replaced by a colon
              (:).

       SYSTEM If  $SYSTEM is set, it will have the same effect as if it had been specified as the argument to the -m
              option.

       MANOPT If $MANOPT is set, it will be parsed prior to man's command line and is expected to be  in  a  similar
              format.   As  all  of  the  other  man specific environment variables can be expressed as command line
              options, and are thus candidates for being included in $MANOPT it is expected that  they  will  become
              obsolete.  N.B. All spaces that should be interpreted as part of an option's argument must be escaped.

       MANWIDTH
              If  $MANWIDTH is set, its value is used as the line length for which manual pages should be formatted.
              If it is not set, manual pages will be formatted with a line length appropriate to the current  termi‐
              nal  (using  an ioctl(2) if available, the value of $COLUMNS, or falling back to 80 characters if nei‐
              ther is available).  Cat pages will only be saved when the default formatting can  be  used,  that  is
              when the terminal line length is between 66 and 80 characters.

       MAN_KEEP_FORMATTING
              Normally,  when  output  is not being directed to a terminal (such as to a file or a pipe), formatting
              characters are discarded to make it easier to read the result  without  special  tools.   However,  if
              $MAN_KEEP_FORMATTING  is  set  to any non-empty value, these formatting characters are retained.  This
              may be useful for wrappers around man that can interpret formatting characters.

       MAN_KEEP_STDERR
              Normally, when output is being directed to a terminal (usually to a pager), any error output from  the
              command  used to produce formatted versions of manual pages is discarded to avoid interfering with the
              pager's display.  Programs such as groff often produce relatively minor  error  messages  about  typo‐
              graphical  problems such as poor alignment, which are unsightly and generally confusing when displayed
              along with the manual page.  However, some users want to see them anyway, so, if  $MAN_KEEP_STDERR  is
              set to any non-empty value, error output will be displayed as usual.

       LANG, LC_MESSAGES
              Depending  on system and implementation, either or both of $LANG and $LC_MESSAGES will be interrogated
              for the current message locale.  man will display its messages in that  locale  (if  available).   See
              setlocale(3) for precise details.
