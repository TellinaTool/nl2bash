SYNOPSIS
       gvfs-info [OPTION...] [LOCATION...]

DESCRIPTION
       gvfs-info shows information about the given locations.

       gvfs-info is similar to the traditional ls utility, but using gvfs locations instead of local files: for
       example you can use something like smb://server/resource/file.txt as location.

       File attributes can be specified with their gvfs name, e.g. standard::icon, or just by namespace, e.g. unix,
       or by '*' which matches all attributes. Several attributes or groups can be specified, separated by comma.

       By default, gvfs-info shows all attributes.

       -h, --help
           Prints a short help text and exits.

       -w, --query-writable
           Show writable attributes and their types.

       -f, --filesystem
           Show information about the filesystem on which the files reside.

       -a, --attributes=ATTRIBUTES
