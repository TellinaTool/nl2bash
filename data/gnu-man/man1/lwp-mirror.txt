NAME
       lwp-mirror - Simple mirror utility

SYNOPSIS
        lwp-mirror [-v] [-t timeout] <url> <local file>

DESCRIPTION
       This program can be used to mirror a document from a WWW server.  The document is only transferred if the
       remote copy is newer than the local copy.  If the local copy is newer nothing happens.

       Use the "-v" option to print the version number of this program.

       The timeout value specified with the "-t" option.  The timeout value is the time that the program will wait
       for response from the remote server before it fails.  The default unit for the timeout value is seconds.  You
       might append "m" or "h" to the timeout value to make it minutes or hours, respectively.

       Because this program is implemented using the LWP library, it only supports the protocols that LWP supports.
