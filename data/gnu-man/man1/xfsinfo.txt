DESCRIPTION
       Xfsinfo  is a utility for displaying information about an X font server.  It is used to examine the capabili‐
       ties of a server, the predefined values for various parameters used in communicating between clients and  the
       server, and the font catalogues and alternate servers that are available.

              mats defined in the Font Server Names section of X(7).   If not specified,  the  server  name  in  the
              FONTSERVER environment variable is used.
