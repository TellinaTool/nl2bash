NAME
       debconf-gettextize - extract translations of debconf templates into PO files

SYNOPSIS
       debconf-gettextize [-v] [-h] [--podir=DIR] [--choices] [--merge] master [master ...]

DESCRIPTION
       The /var/lib/dpkg/info/*.templates files read by debconf contain English text and translations in the same
       file.  But in source packages, translations are managed in separate files to help translators.  In the
       initial implementation, a master templates file contained only English text, and templates.xx files contained
       both original and translated strings for the language xx.  The debconf-mergetemplate program was merging
       master and translated templates files.

       The new implementation with "po-debconf" is based on "gettext".  Maintainers mark translatable fields by
       prepending them with an underscore, English strings are automatically extracted into a POT file, translators
       work on normal PO files, and po2debconf generates a merged templates file with the same structure.

       The debconf-gettextize program was initially designed to help migrating to the new implementation.

       · It reads a list of master files and their associated translations, and generates po/*.po files for each
         language containing translated strings.

       · Each input file receives an ".old" suffix, and a new master file overwrites the old one; it is identical to
         the previous master file except that an underscore is prepended to translatable fields.  Developers can
         then choose which fields translators have to work on and which ones are skipped because their values are
         not locale-dependent.

       · A po/POTFILES.in file is also created, it contains the list of templates files debconf-updatepo has to
         process.

       Typically the debconf-gettextize program must be run only once when transforming from the first
       implementation to the "po-debconf" format, but it can also be used afterwards to transform a "_Choices" field
       into "__Choices" (or vice-versa) without losing translations, when using the "--merge" flag (alongside with
       "--choices" or not).  The desired template containing the "_Choices" or "__Choices" fields to modify has to
       be copied into a temporary template file, which is passed to debconf-gettextize as an argument.  Then the
       following steps are performed:

       1. po2debconf is run on this template file to generate a translated templates file.

       2. This translated templates file is processed as described above and PO files are generated.

       3. Newly created PO files are merged with existing ones.

       When PO files are merged, "_Choices" fields have to be replaced by "__Choices" (or vice-versa) in the
       original templates file before running debconf-updatepo, otherwise new translations will be fuzzy.

OPTIONS
       -h, --help
           Display a usage summary for the program and exit.

       -v, --verbose
           Process in verbose mode.

       --podir=DIR
           Set directory for PO files.  Default is to search for PO files in the po subdirectory below the location
           of the first master file.

       --choices
           By default, debconf-gettextize replaces "Choices" fields by "_Choices".  With this flag, "__Choices"
           fields are written instead.

       --merge
           When this flag is set, the strings are merged with existing PO files.  The templates files and
           po/POTFILES.in are not modified.

CAVEATS
       The "Default" field is special when template type is "Select" or "Multiselect", because a value has to be
       chosen amongst the English list of choices, even for localized values.  Normally this field must not be
       changed, but in rare circumstances localized values are meaningful (e.g. to choose the default language of an
       application).  In order to let translators know that this localized "Default" field is special, you must by
       convention call it "_DefaultChoice" instead of "_Default".
