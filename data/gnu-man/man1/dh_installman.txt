DH_INSTALLMAN(1)                                      Debhelper                                     DH_INSTALLMAN(1)



NAME
       dh_installman - install man pages into package build directories

SYNOPSIS
       dh_installman [debhelper options] [manpage ...]

DESCRIPTION
       dh_installman is a debhelper program that handles installing man pages into the correct locations in package
       build directories. You tell it what man pages go in your packages, and it figures out where to install them
       based on the section field in their .TH or .Dt line. If you have a properly formatted .TH or .Dt line, your
       man page will be installed into the right directory, with the right name (this includes proper handling of
       pages with a subsection, like 3perl, which are placed in man3, and given an extension of .3perl). If your .TH
       or .Dt line is incorrect or missing, the program may guess wrong based on the file extension.

       It also supports translated man pages, by looking for extensions like .ll.8 and .ll_LL.8, or by use of the
       --language switch.

       If dh_installman seems to install a man page into the wrong section or with the wrong extension, this is
       because the man page has the wrong section listed in its .TH or .Dt line. Edit the man page and correct the
       section, and dh_installman will follow suit. See man(7) for details about the .TH section, and mdoc(7) for
       the .Dt section. If dh_installman seems to install a man page into a directory like /usr/share/man/pl/man1/,
       that is because your program has a name like foo.pl, and dh_installman assumes that means it is translated
       into Polish. Use --language=C to avoid this.

       After the man page installation step, dh_installman will check to see if any of the man pages in the
       temporary directories of any of the packages it is acting on contain .so links. If so, it changes them to
       symlinks.

       Also, dh_installman will use man to guess the character encoding of each manual page and convert it to UTF-8.
       If the guesswork fails for some reason, you can override it using an encoding declaration. See manconv(1) for
       details.

FILES
       debian/package.manpages
           Lists man pages to be installed.

OPTIONS
       -A, --all
           Install all files specified by command line parameters in ALL packages acted on.

       --language=ll
           Use this to specify that the man pages being acted on are written in the specified language.

       manpage ...
           Install these man pages into the first package acted on. (Or in all packages if -A is specified).

NOTES
       An older version of this program, dh_installmanpages(1), is still used by some packages, and so is still
       included in debhelper.  It is, however, deprecated, due to its counterintuitive and inconsistent interface.
       Use this program instead.
