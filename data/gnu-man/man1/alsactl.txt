ALSACTL(1)                                     General Commands Manual                                    ALSACTL(1)



NAME
       alsactl - advanced controls for ALSA soundcard driver


SYNOPSIS
       alsactl [options] [store|restore|init] <card # or id or device>


DESCRIPTION
       alsactl is used to control advanced settings for the ALSA soundcard drivers. It supports multiple soundcards.
       If your card has features that you can't seem to control from a mixer application, you have come to the right
       place.


COMMANDS
       store saves the current driver state for the selected soundcard to the configuration file.

       restore  loads driver state for the selected soundcard from the configuration file. If restoring fails (even‐
       tually partly), the init action is called.

       nrestore is like restore, but it notifies also the daemon to do new rescan for available soundcards.

       init tries to initialize all devices to a default state. If device is not known, error code 99 is returned.

       daemon manages to save periodically the sound state.

       rdaemon like daemon but restore the sound state at first.

       kill notifies the daemon to do the specified operation (quit, rescan, save_and_quit).

       If no soundcards are specified, setup for all cards will be saved or loaded.


OPTIONS
       -h, --help
              Help: show available flags and commands.


       -d, --debug
              Use debug mode: a bit more verbose.


       -v, --version
              Print alsactl version number.


       -f, --file
              Select the configuration file to use. The default is /var/lib/alsa/asound.state.


       -F, --force
              Used with restore command.  Try to restore the matching control elements as much  as  possible.   This
              option is set as default now.


       -g, --ignore
              Used  with  store and restore commands. Do not show 'No soundcards found' and do not set an error exit
              code when soundcards are not installed.


       -P, --pedantic
              Used with restore command.  Don't restore mismatching control  elements.   This  option  was  the  old
              default behavior.


       -I, --no-init-fallback
              Don't  initialize  cards if restore fails.  Since version 1.0.18, alsactl tries to initialize the card
              with the restore operation as default.  But this can cause incompatibility  with  the  older  version.
              The  caller may expect that the state won't be touched if no state file exists.  This option takes the
              restore behavior back to the older version by suppressing the initialization.


       -r, --runstate
              Save restore and init state to this file. The file will contain only errors.  Errors are appended with
              the soundcard id to the end of file.


       -R, --remove
              Remove runstate file at first.


       -E, --env #=#
              Set  environment variable (useful for init action or you may override ALSA_CONFIG_PATH to read differ‐
              ent or optimized configuration - may be useful for "boot" scripts).


       -i, --initfile
              The configuration file for init. By default, PREFIX/share/alsa/init/00main is used.


       -p, --period
              The store period in seconds for the daemon command.


       -e, --pid-file
              The pathname to store the process-id file in the HDB UUCP format (ASCII).


       -b, --background
              Run the task in background.


       -s, --syslog
              Use syslog for messages.


       -n, --nice
              Set the process priority (see 'man nice')


       -c, --sched-idle
              Set the process scheduling policy to idle (SCHED_IDLE).


FILES
       /var/lib/alsa/asound.state (or whatever file you specify with the -f flag) is used to store current  settings
       for  your soundcards. The settings include all the usual soundcard mixer settings.  More importantly, alsactl
       is capable of controlling other card-specific features that mixer apps usually don't know about.

       The configuration file is generated automatically by running alsactl store. Editing the configuration file by
       hand  may  be necessary for some soundcard features (e.g. enabling/disabling automatic mic gain, digital out‐
       put, joystick/game ports, some future MIDI routing options, etc).
