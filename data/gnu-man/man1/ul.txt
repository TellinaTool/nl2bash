UL(1)                                        BSD General Commands Manual                                       UL(1)

NAME
     ul — do underlining

SYNOPSIS
     ul [-i] [-t terminal] [file ...]

DESCRIPTION
     The ul utility reads the named files (or standard input if none are given) and translates occurrences of under‐
     scores to the sequence which indicates underlining for the terminal in use, as specified by the environment
     variable TERM.  The file /etc/termcap is read to determine the appropriate sequences for underlining.  If the
     terminal is incapable of underlining, but is capable of a standout mode then that is used instead.  If the ter‐
     minal can overstrike, or handles underlining automatically, ul degenerates to cat(1).  If the terminal cannot
     underline, underlining is ignored.  During the translation some other special characters also get translated.
     E.g. TAB gets expanded to spaces.

     The following options are available:

     -i      Underlining is indicated by a separate line containing appropriate dashes ‘-’; this is useful when you
             want to look at the underlining which is present in an nroff(1) output stream on a CRT-terminal.

     -t terminal
             Overrides the terminal type specified in the environment with terminal.

ENVIRONMENT
     The LANG, LC_ALL, LC_CTYPE and TERM environment variables affect the execution of ul as described in
     environ(7).

EXIT STATUS
     The ul utility exits 0 on success, and >0 if an error occurs.

SEE ALSO
     colcrt(1), man(1), nroff(1)

HISTORY
     The ul command appeared in 3.0BSD.

BUGS
     The nroff(1) command usually outputs a series of backspaces and underlines intermixed with the text to indicate
     underlining.  No attempt is made to optimize the backward motion.
