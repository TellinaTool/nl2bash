NAME
       ln - make links between files

SYNOPSIS
       ln [OPTION]... [-T] TARGET LINK_NAME   (1st form)
       ln [OPTION]... TARGET                  (2nd form)
       ln [OPTION]... TARGET... DIRECTORY     (3rd form)
       ln [OPTION]... -t DIRECTORY TARGET...  (4th form)

DESCRIPTION
       In  the  1st form, create a link to TARGET with the name LINK_NAME.  In the 2nd form, create a link to TARGET
       in the current directory.  In the 3rd and 4th forms, create links to each TARGET in DIRECTORY.   Create  hard
       links by default, symbolic links with --symbolic.  By default, each destination (name of new link) should not
       already exist.  When creating hard links, each TARGET must exist.  Symbolic links can hold arbitrary text; if
       later resolved, a relative link is interpreted in relation to its parent directory.

       Mandatory arguments to long options are mandatory for short options too.

       --backup[=CONTROL]
              make a backup of each existing destination file

       -b     like --backup but does not accept an argument

       -d, -F, --directory
              allow  the  superuser  to  attempt  to  hard  link directories (note: will probably fail due to system
              restrictions, even for the superuser)

       -f, --force
              remove existing destination files

       -i, --interactive
              prompt whether to remove destinations

       -L, --logical
              dereference TARGETs that are symbolic links

       -n, --no-dereference
              treat LINK_NAME as a normal file if it is a symbolic link to a directory

       -P, --physical
              make hard links directly to symbolic links

       -r, --relative
              create symbolic links relative to link location

       -s, --symbolic
              make symbolic links instead of hard links

       -S, --suffix=SUFFIX
              override the usual backup suffix

       -t, --target-directory=DIRECTORY
              specify the DIRECTORY in which to create the links

       -T, --no-target-directory
              treat LINK_NAME as a normal file always

       -v, --verbose
              print name of each linked file

       --help display this help and exit

       --version
              output version information and exit

       The backup suffix is '~', unless set with --suffix or SIMPLE_BACKUP_SUFFIX.  The version control  method  may
       be  selected  via the --backup option or through the VERSION_CONTROL environment variable.  Here are the val‐
       ues:

       none, off
              never make backups (even if --backup is given)

       numbered, t
              make numbered backups

       existing, nil
              numbered if numbered backups exist, simple otherwise

       simple, never
              always make simple backups

       Using -s ignores -L and -P.  Otherwise, the last option specified controls behavior when a TARGET is  a  sym‐
       bolic link, defaulting to -P.
