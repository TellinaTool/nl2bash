NAME
       od - dump files in octal and other formats

SYNOPSIS
       od [OPTION]... [FILE]...
       od [-abcdfilosx]... [FILE] [[+]OFFSET[.][b]]
       od --traditional [OPTION]... [FILE] [[+]OFFSET[.][b] [+][LABEL][.][b]]

DESCRIPTION
       Write  an unambiguous representation, octal bytes by default, of FILE to standard output.  With more than one
       FILE argument, concatenate them in the listed order to form the input.  With no FILE, or when FILE is -, read
       standard input.

       If  first  and second call formats both apply, the second format is assumed if the last operand begins with +
       or (if there are 2 operands) a digit.  An OFFSET operand means -j OFFSET.  LABEL  is  the  pseudo-address  at
       first  byte printed, incremented when dump is progressing.  For OFFSET and LABEL, a 0x or 0X prefix indicates
       hexadecimal; suffixes may be . for octal and b for multiply by 512.

       Mandatory arguments to long options are mandatory for short options too.

       -A, --address-radix=RADIX
              output format for file offsets.  RADIX is one of [doxn], for Decimal, Octal, Hex or None

       -j, --skip-bytes=BYTES
              skip BYTES input bytes first

       -N, --read-bytes=BYTES
              limit dump to BYTES input bytes

       -S BYTES, --strings[=BYTES]
              output strings of at least BYTES graphic chars.  3 is implied when BYTES is not specified

       -t, --format=TYPE
              select output format or formats

       -v, --output-duplicates
              do not use * to mark line suppression

       -w[BYTES], --width[=BYTES]
              output BYTES bytes per output line.  32 is implied when BYTES is not specified

       --traditional
              accept arguments in third form above

       --help display this help and exit

       --version
              output version information and exit

   Traditional format specifications may be intermixed; they accumulate:
       -a     same as -t a,  select named characters, ignoring high-order bit

       -b     same as -t o1, select octal bytes

       -c     same as -t c,  select ASCII characters or backslash escapes

       -d     same as -t u2, select unsigned decimal 2-byte units

       -f     same as -t fF, select floats

       -i     same as -t dI, select decimal ints

       -l     same as -t dL, select decimal longs

       -o     same as -t o2, select octal 2-byte units

       -s     same as -t d2, select decimal 2-byte units

       -x     same as -t x2, select hexadecimal 2-byte units

   TYPE is made up of one or more of these specifications:
       a      named character, ignoring high-order bit

       c      ASCII character or backslash escape

       d[SIZE]
              signed decimal, SIZE bytes per integer

       f[SIZE]
              floating point, SIZE bytes per integer

       o[SIZE]
              octal, SIZE bytes per integer

       u[SIZE]
              unsigned decimal, SIZE bytes per integer

       x[SIZE]
              hexadecimal, SIZE bytes per integer

       SIZE is a number.  For TYPE in [doux], SIZE may also be C  for  sizeof(char),  S  for  sizeof(short),  I  for
       sizeof(int)  or L for sizeof(long).  If TYPE is f, SIZE may also be F for sizeof(float), D for sizeof(double)
       or L for sizeof(long double).

       Adding a z suffix to any type displays printable characters at the end of each output line.

   BYTES is hex with 0x or 0X prefix, and may have a multiplier suffix:
       b      512

       KB     1000

       K      1024

       MB     1000*1000

       M      1024*1024

       and so on for G, T, P, E, Z, Y.
