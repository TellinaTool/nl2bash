NAME
       zcmp, zdiff - compare compressed files

SYNOPSIS
       zcmp [ cmp_options ] file1 [ file2 ]
       zdiff [ diff_options ] file1 [ file2 ]

DESCRIPTION
       Zcmp  and  zdiff  are  used  to invoke the cmp or the diff program on files compressed via gzip.  All options
       specified are passed directly to cmp or diff.  If only file1 is specified, it is compared to the uncompressed
       contents  of file1.gz.  If two files are specified, their contents (uncompressed if necessary) are fed to cmp
       or diff.  The input files are not modified.  The exit status from cmp or diff is preserved.

SEE ALSO
       cmp(1), diff(1), zmore(1), zgrep(1), znew(1), zforce(1), gzip(1), gzexe(1)

BUGS
       Messages from the cmp or diff programs may refer to file names such as "-" instead of to the file names spec‐
       ified.
