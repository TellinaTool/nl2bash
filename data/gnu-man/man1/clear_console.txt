NAME
       clear_console - clear the console

SYNOPSIS
       clear_console

DESCRIPTION
       clear_console clears your console if this is possible.  It looks in the environment for the terminal type and
       then in the terminfo database to figure out how to clear the screen. To clear the buffer, it then changes the
       foreground virtual terminal to another terminal and then back to the original terminal.
