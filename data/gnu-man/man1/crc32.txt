NAME
       crc32 - compute CRC-32 checksums for the given files

SYNOPSIS
       crc32 filename [ filename ... ]

DESCRIPTION
       crc32 is a simple utility that calculates the CRC-32 checksum for each of the given files.

       Note  that  the  CRC-32  checksum  is merely used for error detection in transmission and storage.  It is not
       intended to guard against the malicious modification of files (i.e., it is not a cryptographic hash).

       This utility is supplied with the Archive::Zip module for Perl.

SEE ALSO
       Archive::Zip(3pm).

AUTHOR
