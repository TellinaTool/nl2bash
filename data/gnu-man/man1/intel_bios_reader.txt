SYNOPSIS
       intel_bios_reader filename

DESCRIPTION
       intel_bios_reader  is  a  tool  to  parse  the  contents of an Intel video BIOS file.  The file can come from
       intel_bios_dumper.  This can be used for quick debugging of video bios table handling, which is  harder  when
       done inside of the kernel graphics driver.
