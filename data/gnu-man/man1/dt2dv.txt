DT2DV(1)                                       General Commands Manual                                      DT2DV(1)



NAME
       dt2dv - convert a DTL text representation of a TeX DVI file to a binary DVI file

SYNOPSIS
       dt2dv [-debug] [-group] [-si] [-so] [input-DTL-file] [output-DVI-file]

       In  the absence of the -si and -so options, both file arguments are required in the order input-DTL-file out‐
       put-DVI-file .  But also see the OPTIONS section below.  No default file extensions are supplied.

DESCRIPTION
       dt2dv converts a text representation of a TeX DVI file, usually produced by the companion  dv2dt(1)  utility,
       back  to  a binary DVI file. DTL (DVI Text Language) files can be edited, with care, and then restored to DVI
       form for processing by any TeX DVI driver program.  In DTL files, font directory names  and  font  names  are
       preceded by a length field, which must be updated if the names are modified.

       dvitype(1)  can  also display a textual representation of DVI files, but in some implementations at least, it
       cannot be used in batch mode, and its output is not well-suited for conversion back to a DVI file.

       The format of TeX DVI files is fully described in Donald E. Knuth, TeX: The Program,  Addison-Wesley  (1986),
       ISBN 0-201-13437-3, as well as in the dvitype(1) literate program source code.  Brief descriptions of the DTL
       and DVI formats are given in dv2dt(1).

OPTIONS
       -debug   Turn on detailed debugging output.

       -group   Expect each DTL command to be in parentheses.

       -si      Read all DTL commands from standard input.

       -so      Write all DVI commands to standard output.

SEE ALSO
       dv2dt(1), dvitype(1), tex(1).

FILES
       *.dvi   binary TeX DVI file.

       *.dtl   text representation of a TeX DVI file in DVI Text Language format.
