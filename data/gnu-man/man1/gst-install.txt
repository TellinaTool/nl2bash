NAME
       gst-install - installs missing GStreamer plugins

SYNOPSIS
       gst-install [OPTIONS] plugin ...

DESCRIPTION
       Gst-install  makes  use  of the PackageKit session D-Bus interface to install missing GStreamer plugins, e.g.
       encoders, decoders or  URI  handlers.  It  isn't  supposed  to  be  executed  directly  but  instead  by  the
       gst_install_plugins_async  and  gst_install_plugins  functions  of  the  GStreamer base library gstpbutilsin‐
       stallplugins.

       PackageKit or the alternative session-installer implementation will handle the complete installation  process
       with confirmation, progress and error dialogs.

       See the documentation of gstpbutilsinstallplugins for the argument construction and exit states.

OPTIONS
       --transient-for
              The X Window ID of the window which should be used as parents for the dialogs

DIAGNOSTICS
       None yet.
