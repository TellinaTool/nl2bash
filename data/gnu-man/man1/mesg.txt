MESG(1)                                          Linux User's Manual                                         MESG(1)



NAME
       mesg - control write access to your terminal

SYNOPSIS
       mesg [y|n]

DESCRIPTION
       Mesg controls the access to your terminal by others.  It's typically used to allow or disallow other users to
       write to your terminal (see write(1)).

OPTIONS
       y      Allow write access to your terminal.

       n      Disallow write access to your terminal.

       If no option is given, mesg prints out the current access state of your terminal.

NOTES
       Mesg assumes that its standard input is connected to your terminal. That also means that if you are logged in
       multiple  times, you can get/set the mesg status of other sessions by using redirection.  For example "mesg n
       < /dev/pts/46".
