NAME

SYNOPSIS
       ipptool  [  --help ] [ --stop-after-include-error ] [ --version ] [ -4 ] [ -6 ] [ -C ] [ -E ] [ -I ] [ -L ] [
       -S ] [ -T seconds ] [ -V version ] [ -X ] [ -c ] [ -d name=value ] [ -f filename  ]  [  -i  seconds  ]  [  -n
       repeat-count ] [ -q ] [ -t ] [ -v ] URI filename [ ... filenameN ]

DESCRIPTION
       ipptool  sends  IPP  requests  to  the  specified  URI and tests and/or displays the results. Each named file
       defines one or more requests, including the expected response  status,  attributes,  and  values.  Output  is
       either  a  plain text, formatted text, CSV, or XML report on the standard output, with a non-zero exit status
       indicating that one or more tests have failed. The file format is described in ipptoolfile(5).

OPTIONS
       The following options are recognized by ipptool:

       --help
            Shows program help.

       --stop-after-include-error
            Tells ipptool to stop if an error occurs in an included file. Normally ipptool will continue with subse‐
            quent tests after the INCLUDE directive.

       --version
            Shows the version of ipptool being used.

       -4   Specifies that ipptool must connect to the printer or server using IPv4.

       -6   Specifies that ipptool must connect to the printer or server using IPv6.

       -C   Specifies  that requests should be sent using the HTTP/1.1 "Transfer-Encoding: chunked" header, which is
            required for conformance by all versions of IPP. The default is to use "Transfer-Encoding: chunked"  for
            requests with attached files and "Content-Length:" for requests without attached files.

       -E   Forces TLS encryption when connecting to the server using the HTTP "Upgrade" header.

       -I   Specifies that ipptool will continue past errors.

       -L   Specifies  that  requests  should be sent using the HTTP/1.0 "Content-Length:" header, which is required
            for conformance by all versions of IPP. The default is to use "Transfer-Encoding: chunked" for  requests
            with attached files and "Content-Length:" for requests without attached files.

       -S   Forces (dedicated) SSL encryption when connecting to the server.

       -T seconds
            Specifies a timeout for IPP requests in seconds.

       -V version
            Specifies  the  default IPP version to use: 1.0, 1.1, 2.0, 2.1, or 2.2. If not specified, version 1.1 is
            used.

       -X   Specifies that XML (Apple plist) output is desired instead of the plain  text  report.  This  option  is
            incompatible with the -i (interval) and -n (repeat-count) options.

       -c   Specifies that CSV (comma-separated values) output is desired instead of the plain text output.

       -d name=value
            Defines the named variable.

       -f filename
            Defines the default request filename for tests.

       -i seconds
            Specifies that the (last) file should be repeated at the specified interval. This option is incompatible
            with the -X (XML plist output) option.

       -l   Specifies that plain text output is desired.

       -n repeat-count
            Specifies that the (last) file should be repeated the specified number of times. This option  is  incom‐
            patible with the -X (XML plist output) option.

       -t   Specifies that CUPS test report output is desired instead of the plain text output.

       -v   Specifies  that all request and response attributes should be output in CUPS test mode (-t). This is the
            default for XML output.

EXIT CODE
       The ipptool program returns 0 if all tests were sucessful and 1 otherwise.

COMPATIBILITY
       The ipptool program is unique to CUPS.

EXAMPLES
       Get a list of completed jobs for "myprinter":
           ipptool ipp://localhost/printers/myprinter get-completed-jobs.test

       Send email notifications to "user@example.com" when "myprinter" changes:
           ipptool -d recipient=mailto:user@example.com         ipp://localhost/printers/myprinter create-printer-subscription.test
