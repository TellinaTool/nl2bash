rdoc1.9.1(1)                                   General Commands Manual                                  rdoc1.9.1(1)



NAME
       rdoc1.9.1 - Generate documentation from Ruby script files

SYNOPSIS
           rdoc1.9.1 [options]  [names...]

DESCRIPTION
       Files  are  parsed,  and  the  information they contain collected, before any output is produced. This allows
       cross references between all files to be resolved. If a name is a directory, it is traversed. If no names are
       specified, all Ruby files in the current directory (and subdirectories) are processed.

       Available output formatters: chm, html, ri, xml

       For information on where the output goes, use:
           rdoc --help-output

OPTIONS
       --accessor, -A accessorname[,..]
              comma  separated  list  of  additional  class  methods  that  should be treated like 'attr_reader' and
              friends. Option may be repeated. Each accessorname may have '=text' appended, in which case that  text
              appears where the r/w/rw appears for normal accessors.

       --all, -a
              include all methods (not just public) in the output.

       --charset, -c charset
              specifies HTML character-set

       --debug, -D
              displays lots on internal stuff

       --diagram, -d
              generate  diagrams  showing  modules  and  classes.  You need dot V1.8.6 or later to use the --diagram
              option correctly. Dot is available from <URL:http://www.research.att.com/sw/tools/graphviz/>.

       --exclude, -x pattern
              do not process files or directories matching pattern. Files given explicitly on the command line  will
              never be excluded.

       --extension, -E new=old
              treat  files  ending  with .new as if they ended with .old. Using '-E cgi=rb' will cause xxx.cgi to be
              parsed as a Ruby file

       --fileboxes, -F
              classes are put in boxes which represents files, where these classes reside.  Classes  shared  between
              more than one file are shown with list of files that sharing them.  Silently discarded if --diagram is
              not given Experimental.

       --fmt, -f formatname
              set the output formatter (see below).

       --help, -h
              print usage.

       --help-output, -O
              explain the various output options.

       --image-format, -I gif|png|jpg|jpeg
              sets output image format for diagrams. Can be png, gif, jpeg, jpg. If this option is omitted,  png  is
              used. Requires --diagram.

       --include, -i dir[,dir...]
              set (or add to) the list of directories to be searched when satisfying :include: requests. Can be used
              more than once.

       --inline-source, -S
              show method source code inline, rather than via a popup link.

       --line-numbers, -N
              include line numbers in the source code

       --main, -m name
              name will be the initial page displayed.

       --merge, -M
              when creating ri output, merge processed classes into previously documented classes of the name name.

       --one-file, -1
              put all the output into a single file.

       --op, -o dir
              set the output directory.

       --opname, -n name
              set the name of the output. Has no effect for HTML.

       --promiscuous, -p
              When documenting a file that contains a module or class also defined in other files,  show  all  stuff
              for that module/class in each files page. By default, only show stuff defined in that particular file.

       --quiet, -q
              don't show progress as we parse.

       --ri, -r
              generate  output for use by 'ri.' The files are stored in the '.rdoc' directory under your home direc‐
              tory unless overridden by a subsequent --op parameter, so no special privileges are needed.

       --ri-site, -R
              generate output for use by 'ri.' The files are stored in a site-wide directory, making them accessible
              to others, so special privileges are needed.

       --ri-system, -Y
              generate  output for use by 'ri.' The files are stored in a system-level directory, making them acces‐
              sible to others, so special privileges are needed. This option is intended  to  be  used  during  Ruby
              installations.

       --show-hash, -H
              a  name  of  the form #name in a comment is a possible hyperlink to an instance method name. When dis‐
              played, the '#' is removed unless this option is specified.

       --style, -s stylesheet-url
              specifies the URL of a separate stylesheet.

       --tab-width, -w n
              set the width of tab characters (default 8).

       --template, -T template-name
              set the template used when generating output.

       --title, -t text
              set text as the title for the output.

       --version, -v
              display  RDoc's version.

       --webcvs, -W url
              specify a URL for linking to a web frontend to CVS. If the URL contains a ´%s', the name of  the  cur‐
              rent file will be substituted; if the URL doesn't contain a '%s', the filename will be appended to it.
