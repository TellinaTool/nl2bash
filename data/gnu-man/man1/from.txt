SYNOPSIS
     from [-c] [-f file] [-s sender] [user]

DESCRIPTION

     The following options are available:

     -c      Just print a count of messages and exit.

     -f file
             The supplied file is examined instead of the invoker's mailbox.  If the -f option is used, the user
             argument should not be used.  Read from standard input if file name “-” is given.

     -s sender
             Only mail from addresses containing the supplied string are printed.

     If user is given, the user's mailbox is examined instead of the invoker's own mailbox.  (Privileges are
     required.)

ENVIRONMENT
