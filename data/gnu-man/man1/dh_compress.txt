NAME
       dh_compress - compress files and fix symlinks in package build directories

SYNOPSIS
       dh_compress [debhelper options] [-Xitem] [-A] [file ...]

DESCRIPTION
       dh_compress is a debhelper program that is responsible for compressing the files in package build
       directories, and makes sure that any symlinks that pointed to the files before they were compressed are
       updated to point to the new files.

       By default, dh_compress compresses files that Debian policy mandates should be compressed, namely all files
       in usr/share/info, usr/share/man, files in usr/share/doc that are larger than 4k in size, (except the
       copyright file, .html and other web files, image files, and files that appear to be already compressed based
       on their extensions), and all changelog files. Plus PCF fonts underneath usr/share/fonts/X11/

FILES
       debian/package.compress
           These files are deprecated.

           If this file exists, the default files are not compressed. Instead, the file is ran as a shell script,
           and all filenames that the shell script outputs will be compressed. The shell script will be run from
           inside the package build directory. Note though that using -X is a much better idea in general; you
           should only use a debian/package.compress file if you really need to.

OPTIONS
       -Xitem, --exclude=item
           Exclude files that contain item anywhere in their filename from being compressed. For example, -X.tiff
           will exclude TIFF files from compression.  You may use this option multiple times to build up a list of
           things to exclude.

       -A, --all
           Compress all files specified by command line parameters in ALL packages acted on.

       file ...
           Add these files to the list of files to compress.

CONFORMS TO
       Debian policy, version 3.0
