NAME
       dpkg-distaddfile - add entries to debian/files

SYNOPSIS
       dpkg-distaddfile [option...] filename section priority

DESCRIPTION
       dpkg-distaddfile adds an entry for a named file to debian/files.

       It takes three non-option arguments, the filename and the section and priority for the .changes file.

       The  filename  should  be  specified  relative to the directory where dpkg-genchanges will expect to find the
       files, usually .., rather than being a pathname relative to the current directory  when  dpkg-distaddfile  is
       run.

OPTIONS
       -ffiles-list-file
              Read or write the list of files to be uploaded here, rather than using debian/files.

       -?, --help
              Show the usage message and exit.

       --version
              Show the version and exit.

FILES
       debian/files
              The list of generated files which are part of the upload being prepared.  dpkg-distaddfile can be used
              to add additional files.
