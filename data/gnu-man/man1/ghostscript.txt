NAME
       gs - Ghostscript (PostScript and PDF language interpreter and previewer)

SYNOPSIS
       gs [ options ] [ files ] ... (Unix, VMS)
       gswin32c [ options ] [ files ] ... (MS Windows)
       gswin32 [ options ] [ files ] ... (MS Windows 3.1)
       gsos2 [ options ] [ files ] ... (OS/2)

DESCRIPTION
       The  gs  (gswin32c,  gswin32,  gsos2)  command  invokes  Ghostscript,  an interpreter of Adobe Systems' Post‐
       Script(tm) and Portable Document Format (PDF) languages.  gs reads "files" in sequence and executes  them  as
       Ghostscript  programs.  After doing this, it reads further input from the standard input stream (normally the
       keyboard), interpreting each line separately and output to an output device (may be a file or an  X11  window
       preview, see below). The interpreter exits gracefully when it encounters the "quit" command (either in a file
       or from the keyboard), at end-of-file, or at an interrupt signal (such as Control-C at the keyboard).

       The interpreter recognizes many option switches, some of which are described below. Please see the usage doc‐
       umentation  for complete information. Switches may appear anywhere in the command line and apply to all files
       thereafter.  Invoking Ghostscript with the -h or -? switch produces a  message  which  shows  several  useful
       switches,  all the devices known to that executable, and the search path for fonts; on Unix it also shows the
       location of detailed documentation.

       Ghostscript may be built to use many  different  output  devices.   To  see  which  devices  your  executable
       includes, run "gs -h".

       Unless  you specify a particular device, Ghostscript normally opens the first one of those and directs output
       to it.

       If built with X11 support, often the default device is an X11 window (previewer), else ghostscript will typi‐
       cally use the bbox device and print on stdout the dimension of the postscript file.

       So if the first one in the list is the one you want to use, just issue the command

            gs myfile.ps

       You can also check the set of available devices from within Ghostscript: invoke Ghostscript and type

            devicenames ==

       but  the  first  device  on  the resulting list may not be the default device you determine with "gs -h".  To
       specify "AbcXyz" as the initial output device, include the switch

            -sDEVICE=AbcXyz

       For example, for output to an Epson printer you might use the command

            gs -sDEVICE=epson myfile.ps

       The "-sDEVICE=" switch must precede the first mention of a file to print, and only the switch's first use has
       any effect.

       Finally, you can specify a default device in the environment variable GS_DEVICE.  The order of precedence for
       these alternatives from highest to lowest (Ghostscript uses the device defined highest in the list) is:

       Some devices can support different resolutions (densities).  To specify the resolution on such a printer, use
       the "-r" switch:

            gs -sDEVICE=<device> -r<xres>x<yres>

       For example, on a 9-pin Epson-compatible printer, you get the lowest-density (fastest) mode with

            gs -sDEVICE=epson -r60x72

       and the highest-density (best output quality) mode with

            gs -sDEVICE=epson -r240x72.

       If  you  select a printer as the output device, Ghostscript also allows you to choose where Ghostscript sends
       the output -- on Unix systems, usually to a temporary file.  To send the output to a file "foo.xyz", use  the
       switch

            -sOutputFile=foo.xyz

       You  might  want  to print each page separately.  To do this, send the output to a series of files "foo1.xyz,
       foo2.xyz, ..." using the "-sOutputFile=" switch with "%d" in a filename template:

            -sOutputFile=foo%d.xyz

       Each resulting file receives one page of output, and the files are numbered in sequence.  "%d"  is  a  printf
       format specification; you can also use a variant like "%02d".

       On  Unix and MS Windows systems you can also send output to a pipe.  For example, to pipe output to the "lpr"
       command (which, on many Unix systems, directs it to a printer), use the option

            -sOutputFile=%pipe%lpr

       Note that the '%' characters need to be doubled on MS Windows to avoid mangling by the command interpreter.

       You can also send output to standard output:

            -sOutputFile=-
       or
            -sOutputFile=%stdout%

       In this case you must also use the -q switch, to prevent Ghostscript from writing messages to  standard  out‐
       put.

       To select a specific paper size, use the command line switch

            -sPAPERSIZE=<paper_size>

       for instance

            -sPAPERSIZE=a4
       or
            -sPAPERSIZE=legal

       Most  ISO  and US paper sizes are recognized. See the usage documentation for a full list, or the definitions
       in the initialization file "gs_statd.ps".

       Ghostscript can do many things other than print or view PostScript and PDF files.  For example, if  you  want
       to  know  the  bounding  box of a PostScript (or EPS) file, Ghostscript provides a special "device" that just
       prints out this information.

       For example, using one of the example files distributed with Ghostscript,

            gs -sDEVICE=bbox golfer.ps

       prints out

            %%BoundingBox: 0 25 583 732
            %%HiResBoundingBox: 0.808497 25.009496 582.994503 731.809445

OPTIONS
       -- filename arg1 ...
              Takes the next argument as a file name as usual, but takes all remaining arguments (even if they  have
              the  syntactic  form of switches) and defines the name "ARGUMENTS" in "userdict" (not "systemdict") as
              an array of those strings, before running the file.  When Ghostscript finishes executing the file,  it
              exits back to the shell.

       -Dname=token
       -dname=token
              Define  a  name  in  "systemdict"  with the given definition.  The token must be exactly one token (as
              defined by the "token" operator) and may contain no whitespace.

       -Dname
       -dname Define a name in "systemdict" with value=null.

       -Sname=string
       -sname=string
              Define a name in "systemdict" with a given string as value.  This is different from -d.  For  example,
              -dname=35 is equivalent to the program fragment
                   /name 35 def
              whereas -sname=35 is equivalent to
                   /name (35) def

       -P     Makes  Ghostscript  to look first in the current directory for library files.  By default, Ghostscript
              no longer looks in the current directory, unless, of course, the first explicitly  supplied  directory
              is  "." in -I.  See also the INITIALIZATION FILES section below, and bundled Use.htm for detailed dis‐
              cussion on search paths and how Ghostcript finds files.

       -q     Quiet startup: suppress normal startup messages, and also do the equivalent of -dQUIET.

       -gnumber1xnumber2
              Equivalent to -dDEVICEWIDTH=number1 and -dDEVICEHEIGHT=number2.  This is for the  benefit  of  devices
              (such as X11 windows) that require (or allow) width and height to be specified.

       -rnumber
       -rnumber1xnumber2
              Equivalent to -dDEVICEXRESOLUTION=number1 and -dDEVICEYRESOLUTION=number2.  This is for the benefit of
              devices such as printers that support multiple X and Y resolutions.  If only one number is  given,  it
              is used for both X and Y resolutions.

       -Idirectories
              Adds the designated list of directories at the head of the search path for library files.

       -      This is not really a switch, but indicates to Ghostscript that standard input is coming from a file or
              a pipe and not interactively from the command line.  Ghostscript reads from standard  input  until  it
              reaches  end-of-file, executing it like any other file, and then continues with processing the command
              line.  When the command line has been entirely processed, Ghostscript exits rather than going into its
              interactive mode.

       Note  that  the  normal initialization file "gs_init.ps" makes "systemdict" read-only, so the values of names
       defined with -D, -d, -S, or -s cannot be changed (although, of course, they can be superseded by  definitions
       in "userdict" or other dictionaries.)

SPECIAL NAMES
       -dDISKFONTS
              Causes  individual  character outlines to be loaded from the disk the first time they are encountered.
              (Normally Ghostscript loads all the character outlines when it loads a font.)  This may allow  loading
              more fonts into RAM, at the expense of slower rendering.

       -dNOCACHE
              Disables character caching.  Useful only for debugging.

       -dNOBIND
              Disables the "bind" operator.  Useful only for debugging.

       -dNODISPLAY
              Suppresses the normal initialization of the output device.  This may be useful when debugging.

       -dNOPAUSE
              Disables  the  prompt and pause at the end of each page.  This may be desirable for applications where
              another program is driving Ghostscript.

       -dNOPLATFONTS
              Disables the use of fonts supplied by the underlying platform (for instance X Windows).  This  may  be
              needed if the platform fonts look undesirably different from the scalable fonts.

       -dSAFER
              Restricts  file operations the job can perform.  Strongly recommended for spoolers, conversion scripts
              or other sensitive environments where a badly written or malicious PostScript  program  code  must  be
              prevented from changing important files.

       -dWRITESYSTEMDICT
              Leaves  "systemdict" writable.  This is necessary when running special utility programs such as font2c
              and pcharstr, which must bypass normal PostScript access protection.

       -sDEVICE=device
              Selects an alternate initial output device, as described above.

       -sOutputFile=filename
              Selects an alternate output file (or pipe) for the initial output device, as described above.

SAFER MODE
       The -dSAFER option disables the "deletefile" and "renamefile" operators and prohibits opening piped  commands
       ("%pipe%cmd").  Only  "%stdout" and "%stderr" can be opened for writing. It also disables reading from files,
       except for "%stdin", files given as a command line argument, and files contained in paths  given  by  LIBPATH
       and FONTPATH or specified by the system params /FontResourceDir and /GenericResourceDir.

       This  mode also sets the .LockSafetyParams parameter of the initial output device to protect against programs
       that attempt to write to files using the OutputFile device parameter. Since the device  parameters  specified
       on the command line, including OutputFile, are set prior to SAFER mode, use of "-sOutputFile=..." on the com‐
       mand line is unrestricted.

       SAFER mode prevents changing the /GenericResourceDir, /FontResourceDir, /SystemParamsPassword, and /StartJob‐
       Password.

       While SAFER mode is not the default, it is the default for many wrapper scripts such as ps2pdf and may be the
       default in a subsequent release of Ghostscript.  Thus when running programs that need to open  files  or  set
       restricted parameters you should pass the -dNOSAFER command line option or its synonym -dDELAYSAFER.

       When running with -dNOSAFER it is possible to perform a "save" followed by ".setsafe", execute a file or pro‐
       cedure in SAFER mode, and then use "restore" to return to NOSAFER mode.  In order to prevent the save  object
       from  being  restored by the foreign file or procedure, the ".runandhide" operator should be used to hide the
       save object from the restricted procedure.

FILES
       The locations of many Ghostscript run-time files are compiled into the executable when it is built.  On  Unix
       these  are typically based in /usr/local, but this may be different on your system.  Under DOS they are typi‐
       cally based in C:\GS, but may be elsewhere, especially if you install Ghostscript with GSview.  Run  "gs  -h"
       to  find  the location of Ghostscript documentation on your system, from which you can get more details. On a
       Debian system they are in /usr.

       /usr/share/gs-gpl/#.##/*/*
              Startup files, utilities, and basic font definitions

       /usr/share/fonts/type1/gsfonts/*
              More font definitions from the gsfonts package

       /usr/share/doc/gs-gpl/examples/*
              Ghostscript demonstration files

       /usr/share/doc/gs-gpl/*
              Diverse document files

INITIALIZATION FILES
       When looking for the initialization files "gs_*.ps", the files related to fonts, or the file  for  the  "run"
       operator,  Ghostscript  first tries to open the file with the name as given, using the current working direc‐
       tory if no directory is specified.  If this fails, and the file name doesn't specify an explicit directory or
       drive  (for  instance,  doesn't  contain "/" on Unix systems or "\" on MS Windows systems), Ghostscript tries
       directories in this order:

       1.  the directories specified by the -I switches in the command line (see below), if any;

       2.  the directories specified by the GS_LIB environment variable, if any;

       3.  the directories specified by the GS_LIB_DEFAULT macro in the Ghostscript makefile when the executable was
           built.     When   gs   is   built   on   Unix,   GS_LIB_DEFAULT   is   usually   "/usr/local/share/ghost‐
           script/#.##:/usr/local/share/ghostscript/fonts" where "#.##" represents the Ghostscript  version  number.
           They are "/usr/share/gs-gpl/#.## on a Debian system".

       Each of these (GS_LIB_DEFAULT, GS_LIB, and -I parameter) may be either a single directory or a list of direc‐
       tories separated by ":".

ENVIRONMENT
       GS_OPTIONS
              String of options to be processed before the command line options

       GS_DEVICE
              Used to specify an output device

       GS_FONTPATH
              Path names used to search for fonts

       GS_LIB Path names for initialization files and fonts

       TEMP   Where temporary files are made

X RESOURCES
       Ghostscript, or more properly the X11 display device, looks for the following  resources  under  the  program
       name "Ghostscript":

       borderWidth
              The border width in pixels (default = 1).

       borderColor
              The name of the border color (default = black).

       geometry
              The window size and placement, WxH+X+Y (default is NULL).

       xResolution
              The number of x pixels per inch (default is computed from WidthOfScreen and WidthMMOfScreen).

       yResolution
              The number of y pixels per inch (default is computed from HeightOfScreen and HeightMMOfScreen).

       useBackingPixmap
              Determines whether backing store is to be used for saving display window (default = true).

       See  the usage document for a more complete list of resources.  To set these resources on Unix, put them in a
       file such as "~/.Xresources" in the following form:

            Ghostscript*geometry:     612x792-0+0
            Ghostscript*xResolution: 72
            Ghostscript*yResolution: 72

       Then merge these resources into the X server's resource database:

            % xrdb -merge ~/.Xresources
