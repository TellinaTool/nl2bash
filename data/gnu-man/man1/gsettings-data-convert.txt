NAME
       gsettings-data-convert - GConf to GSettings data migration

SYNOPSIS
       gsettings-data-convert [option...]

DESCRIPTION
       gsettings-data-convert reads values out of the users GConf database and stores them in GSettings.

       The information about the mapping from GConf keys to GSettings keys is taken from files in
       /usr/share/GConf/gsettings. Each file in that directory is read as a key file, with sections for each
       GSettings schema that is being converted. The entries in each section map GSettings keys to paths in the
       GConf database. Currently, gsettings-data-convert supports all basic GConf types as well as lists of strings
       and lists of integers.

       A simple example might look like this:

           [org.gnome.fonts]
           antialiasing = /desktop/gnome/font_rendering/antialiasing
           dpi = /desktop/gnome/font_rendering/dpi
           hinting = /desktop/gnome/font_rendering/hinting
           rgba_order = /desktop/gnome/font_rendering/rgba_order

       If the GSettings schema does not have a fixed path, you must specify the path in the group name, separated by
       a colon character:

           [org.gnome.fonts:/desktop/gnome/font-rendering/]

       gsettings-data-convert keeps a list of the key files it has already converted, so it is safe to run it
       repeatedly to handle newly appeared key files. The expected use of this utility is to make each application
       install a key file for the GConf keys that it wants to be migrated, and run gsettings-data-convert every time
       a user logs in.

   Options
       -h, --help
           Print help and exit

           Do not make any changes, just report what would be done

       --verbose
           Show verbose messages
