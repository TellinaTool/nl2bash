NAME
       mkocp - frontend to otp2ocp(1)

SYNOPSIS
       mkocp OTPFILE

DESCRIPTION
       mkocp  is  used  to  create  or recreate Omega Compiled Process files (binary) from Omega Translation Process
       (text) files.

       Omega Translation Processes are used to translate one character set to another and to choose between  charac‐
       ters  with one or more context-sensitive variants.  OTPs could also be used to change the case or hyphenation
       of text.

       OTPs are defined in text files, and compiled into binary code (OCPs) using mkocp (this  script)  or  directly
       with otp2ocp(1).

FILES
       OTPFILE
              An Omega Typesetting Process filter file.
