NAME
       df - report file system disk space usage

SYNOPSIS
       df [OPTION]... [FILE]...

DESCRIPTION
       This manual page documents the GNU version of df.  df displays the amount of disk space available on the file
       system containing each file name argument.  If no file name is given, the space available  on  all  currently
       mounted  file systems is shown.  Disk space is shown in 1K blocks by default, unless the environment variable
       POSIXLY_CORRECT is set, in which case 512-byte blocks are used.

       If an argument is the absolute file name of a disk device node containing a mounted file system, df shows the
       space  available  on  that  file  system  rather than on the file system containing the device node (which is
       always the root file system).  This version of df cannot show the space available on unmounted file  systems,
       because  on most kinds of systems doing so requires very nonportable intimate knowledge of file system struc‐
       tures.

OPTIONS
       Show information about the file system on which each FILE resides, or all file systems by default.

       Mandatory arguments to long options are mandatory for short options too.

       -a, --all
              include dummy file systems

       -B, --block-size=SIZE
              scale sizes by SIZE before printing them.  E.g., '-BM' prints sizes in units of 1,048,576 bytes.   See
              SIZE format below.

       -h, --human-readable
              print sizes in human readable format (e.g., 1K 234M 2G)

       -H, --si
              likewise, but use powers of 1000 not 1024

       -i, --inodes
              list inode information instead of block usage

       -k     like --block-size=1K

       -l, --local
              limit listing to local file systems

       --no-sync
              do not invoke sync before getting usage info (default)

       --output[=FIELD_LIST]
              use the output format defined by FIELD_LIST, or print all fields if FIELD_LIST is omitted.

       -P, --portability
              use the POSIX output format

       --sync invoke sync before getting usage info

       --total
              elide all entries insignificant to available space, and produce a grand total

       -t, --type=TYPE
              limit listing to file systems of type TYPE

       -T, --print-type
              print file system type

       -x, --exclude-type=TYPE
              limit listing to file systems not of type TYPE

       -v     (ignored)

       --help display this help and exit

       --version
              output version information and exit

       Display  values are in units of the first available SIZE from --block-size, and the DF_BLOCK_SIZE, BLOCK_SIZE
       and BLOCKSIZE environment variables.  Otherwise, units default to 1024 bytes (or 512  if  POSIXLY_CORRECT  is
       set).

       SIZE  is an integer and optional unit (example: 10M is 10*1024*1024).  Units are K, M, G, T, P, E, Z, Y (pow‐
       ers of 1024) or KB, MB, ... (powers of 1000).

       FIELD_LIST is a comma-separated list of columns to be included.  Valid field names are:  'source',  'fstype',
       'itotal', 'iused', 'iavail', 'ipcent', 'size', 'used', 'avail', 'pcent' and 'target' (see info page).
