NAME
       dh_fixperms - fix permissions of files in package build directories

SYNOPSIS
       dh_fixperms [debhelper options] [-Xitem]

DESCRIPTION
       dh_fixperms is a debhelper program that is responsible for setting the permissions of files and directories
       in package build directories to a sane state -- a state that complies with Debian policy.

       dh_fixperms makes all files in usr/share/doc in the package build directory (excluding files in the examples/
       directory) be mode 644. It also changes the permissions of all man pages to mode 644. It makes all files be
       owned by root, and it removes group and other write permission from all files. It removes execute permissions
       from any libraries, headers, Perl modules, or desktop files that have it set. It makes all files in the
       standard bin and sbin directories, usr/games/ and etc/init.d executable (since v4). Finally, it removes the
       setuid and setgid bits from all files in the package.

OPTIONS
       -Xitem, --exclude item
           Exclude files that contain item anywhere in their filename from having their permissions changed. You may
           use this option multiple times to build up a list of things to exclude.

SEE ALSO

       This program is a part of debhelper.
