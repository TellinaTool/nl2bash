NAME
       dbus-launch - Utility to start a message bus from a shell script

SYNOPSIS
       dbus-launch   [--version]   [--sh-syntax]   [--csh-syntax]   [--auto-syntax]  [--exit-with-session]  [--auto‐
       launch=MACHINEID] [--config-file=FILENAME] [PROGRAM] [ARGS...]


DESCRIPTION
       The dbus-launch command is used to start a session bus instance of dbus-daemon from a shell script.  It would
       normally  be called from a user's login scripts. Unlike the daemon itself, dbus-launch exits, so backticks or
       the $() construct can be used to read information from dbus-launch.

       With no arguments, dbus-launch will launch a session bus instance and print  the  address  and  PID  of  that
       instance to standard output.

       You  may  specify  a program to be run; in this case, dbus-launch will launch a session bus instance, set the
       appropriate environment variables so the specified program can find the bus, and then execute  the  specified
       program, with the specified arguments.  See below for examples.

       If you launch a program, dbus-launch will not print the information about the new bus to standard output.

       When dbus-launch prints bus information to standard output, by default it is in a simple key-value pairs for‐
       mat. However, you may request several alternate syntaxes using the --sh-syntax,  --csh-syntax,  --binary-syn‐
       tax,  or  --auto-syntax options. Several of these cause dbus-launch to emit shell code to set up the environ‐
       ment.

       With the --auto-syntax option, dbus-launch looks at the value of the SHELL environment variable to  determine
       which  shell  syntax  should be used.  If SHELL ends in "csh", then csh-compatible code is emitted; otherwise
       Bourne shell code is emitted.  Instead of passing --auto-syntax, you may explicitly specify a particular  one
       by  using  --sh-syntax  for  Bourne  syntax, or --csh-syntax for csh syntax.  In scripts, it's more robust to
       avoid --auto-syntax and you hopefully know which shell your script is written in.


       See http://www.freedesktop.org/software/dbus/ for more information about D-Bus. See also  the  man  page  for
       dbus-daemon.


EXAMPLES
       Distributions  running dbus-launch as part of a standard X session should run dbus-launch --exit-with-session
       after the X server has started and become available, as a wrapper around the "main"  X  client  (typically  a
       session manager or window manager), as in these examples:

              dbus-launch --exit-with-session gnome-session

              dbus-launch --exit-with-session openbox

              dbus-launch --exit-with-session ~/.xsession

       If your distribution does not do this, you can achieve similar results by running your session or window man‐
       ager in the same way in a script run by your X session, such as ~/.xsession, ~/.xinitrc or ~/.Xclients.

       To start a D-Bus session within a text-mode session, you can run dbus-launch in the background. For instance,
       in a sh-compatible shell:

         ## test for an existing bus daemon, just to be safe
         if test -z "$DBUS_SESSION_BUS_ADDRESS" ; then
             ## if not found, launch a new one
             eval `dbus-launch --sh-syntax`
             echo "D-Bus per-session daemon address is: $DBUS_SESSION_BUS_ADDRESS"
         fi
       Note  that  in  this  case,  dbus-launch  will  exit, and dbus-daemon will not be terminated automatically on
       logout.


AUTOMATIC LAUNCHING
       If DBUS_SESSION_BUS_ADDRESS is not set for a process that tries to use D-Bus, by  default  the  process  will
       attempt to invoke dbus-launch with the --autolaunch option to start up a new session bus or find the existing
       bus address on the X display or in a file in ~/.dbus/session-bus/


       Whenever an autolaunch occurs, the application that had to start a new bus will be in its own  little  world;
       it  can effectively end up starting a whole new session if it tries to use a lot of bus services. This can be
       suboptimal or even totally broken, depending on the app and what it tries to do.


       There are two common reasons for autolaunch. One is ssh to a remote machine. The ideal fix for that would  be
       forwarding  of  DBUS_SESSION_BUS_ADDRESS in the same way that DISPLAY is forwarded.  In the meantime, you can
       edit the session.conf config file to have your  session  bus  listen  on  TCP,  and  manually  set  DBUS_SES‐
       SION_BUS_ADDRESS, if you like.


       The  second  common  reason for autolaunch is an su to another user, and display of X applications running as
       the second user on the display belonging to the first user. Perhaps the ideal fix in this case  would  be  to
       allow  the second user to connect to the session bus of the first user, just as they can connect to the first
       user's display.  However, a mechanism for that has not been coded.


       You can always avoid autolaunch by manually setting DBUS_SESSION_BUS_ADDRESS. Autolaunch happens because  the
       default  address if none is set is "autolaunch:", so if any other address is set there will be no autolaunch.
       You can however include autolaunch in an explicit session bus address as a fallback,  for  example  DBUS_SES‐
       SION_BUS_ADDRESS="something:,autolaunch:"  -  in  that case if the first address doesn't work, processes will
       autolaunch. (The bus address variable contains a comma-separated list of addresses to try.)


       The --autolaunch option is considered an internal implementation detail of libdbus, and  in  fact  there  are
       plans to change it. There's no real reason to use it outside of the libdbus implementation anyhow.


OPTIONS
       The following options are supported:

       --auto-syntax
              Choose --csh-syntax or --sh-syntax based on the SHELL environment variable.

              --binary-syntax  Write to stdout a nul-terminated bus address, then the bus PID as a binary integer of
              size sizeof(pid_t), then the bus X window ID as a binary integer of size sizeof(long). Integers are in
              the machine's byte order, not network byte order or any other canonical byte order.


       --close-stderr
              Close the standard error output stream before starting the D-Bus daemon. This is useful if you want to
              capture dbus-launch error messages but you don't want dbus-daemon to keep  the  stream  open  to  your
              application.


       --config-file=FILENAME
              Pass  --config-file=FILENAME  to the bus daemon, instead of passing it the --session argument. See the
              man page for dbus-daemon


       --csh-syntax
              Emit csh compatible code to set up environment variables.


       --exit-with-session
              If this option is provided, a persistent "babysitter" process will be created that watches  stdin  for
              HUP  and  tries to connect to the X server. If this process gets a HUP on stdin or loses its X connec‐
              tion, it kills the message bus daemon.


       --autolaunch=MACHINEID
              This option implies that dbus-launch should scan for a previously-started session and reuse the values
              found  there.  If  no session is found, it will start a new session. The --exit-with-session option is
              implied if --autolaunch is given.  This option is for the exclusive use of libdbus, you do not want to
              use it manually. It may change in the future.


       --sh-syntax
              Emit Bourne-shell compatible code to set up environment variables.


       --version
              Print the version of dbus-launch


NOTES
       If  you run dbus-launch myapp (with any other options), dbus-daemon will not exit when myapp terminates: this
       is because myapp is assumed to be part of a larger session, rather than a session in its own right.
