NAME
       pktogf - convert packed font files to generic font files

SYNOPSIS
       pktogf [-v] pk_file_name [gf_file_name]

DESCRIPTION
       This  manual  page  is not meant to be exhaustive.  The complete documentation for this version of TeX can be
       found in the info file or manual Web2C: A TeX implementation.

       The pktogf program converts a packed font file (pk) to a generic font file (gf).  Packed font files are  much
       smaller than the corresponding gf files, but some DVI readers only understand gf files.

       The  pk_file_name  on  the command line must be complete. Because the resolution is part of the extension, it
       would not make sense to append a default  extension  as  is  done  with  TeX  or  DVI-reading  software.  The
       gf_file_name  defaults  to  the same (stripped) name as pk_file_name, and it is placed in the current working
       directory with the gf suffix replacing pk.  For example, the input file io.300pk would become io.300gf.

OPTIONS
       Unless the -v switch is given, pktogf operates silently.  With -v, the version number of the program and sta‐
       tistics about the unpacking are output to stdout.

ENVIRONMENT
       pktogf  looks for pk_file_name using the environment variable PKFONTS.  If that is not set, it uses the vari‐
       able TEXPKS.  If that is not set, it uses TEXFONTS.  If that is not set, it uses the system default.

       See tex(1) for the details of the searching.
