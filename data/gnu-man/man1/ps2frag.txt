NAME
       ps2frag - obsolete shell script for the PSfrag system.

IMPORTANT NOTICE
       The  new  PSfrag  system  no  longer requires the ps2frag script; instead, it handles the processing entirely
       within TeX/LaTeX and DVIPS. I'm sure you will agree that never needing to run ps2frag again is a nice  conve‐
       nience!

       However, there are two significant differences in the way this new version of PSfrag works. Please make your‐
       self aware of them:

       1) XDvi is no longer able to determine where your PSfrag replacements should go, so instead it lines them  up
       in  a  vertical  list to the left of the figure. This allows you to confirm that they have been typeset prop‐
       erly, at least. However, to confirm that PSfrag positions your replacements properly, you will have  to  view
       the PostScript version of your file with a viewer like GhostView, or print it out.  This seems to be the only
       disadvantage to the elimination of the pre-processing step.

       2) If you embed '\tex' commands inside your figures, you now need to  explicitly  _tell_  PSfrag  to  process
       these commands. To do so, use \usepackage[scanall]{psfrag} instead of \usepackage{psfrag} at the beginning of
       your LaTeX file.

       If you only use '\tex' commands in a small number of figures, then a more  efficient  might  be  to  turn  on
       '\tex'-scanning  only  for those figures. To do that, add the command '\psfragscanon' immediately before each
       relevant \includegraphics or \epsfbox command.

NOTES
       See the PSfrag documentation for further information.
