NAME
       pbmtoepsi - convert a portable bitmap into an encapsulated PostScript style preview bitmap

SYNOPSIS
       pbmtoepsi [-bbonly] [pbmfile]

DESCRIPTION
       Reads  a  portable bitmap as input.  Produce an encapsulated Postscript style bitmap as output. The output is
       not a stand alone postscript file, it is only a preview bitmap, which can  be  included  in  an  encapsulated
       PostScript file.  Note that there is no epsitopbm tool - this transformation is one way.

       This utility is a part of the pstoepsi tool by Doug Crabill (dgc@cs.purdue.edu).

OPTIONS
       -bbonly
              Only create a boundary box, don't fill it with the image.
