NAME
       inspect - Boost code inspection tool

SYNOPSIS
       inspect [-cvs] [-text] [-brief] [options...]

DESCRIPTION
       It  is  not uncommon for various common errors or guideline violations to creep into the Boost libraries. The
       inspect program detects and reports several common problems. It can be used to scan a proposed Boost  submis‐
       sion to identify various failures.

       The program is run in the directory to be scanned for errors. Sub-directories are also included in the scan.

       If  the  first  program argument is -cvs, only files and directories in the CVS tree of the current directory
       are scanned. Otherwise all files and sub-directories are included in the scan.

              Options:

       -license

       -copyright

       -crlf

       -link

       -path_name

       -tab

       -ascii

       -minmax

       -unnamed

              The default is to have all checks on; otherwise options specify desired checks.
