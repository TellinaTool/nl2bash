DH_PYPY(1)                                                                                                DH_PYPY(1)



NAME
       dh_pypy - calculates PyPy dependencies, adds maintainer scripts to byte compile files, etc.

SYNOPSIS
          dh_pypy -p PACKAGE [-V [X.Y][-][A.B]] DIR [-X REGEXPR]

DESCRIPTION
   QUICK GUIDE FOR MAINTAINERS
          · build-depend on pypy and dh-python,

          · add ${pypy:Depends} to Depends

          · build module/application using its standard build system,

          · install files to the standard locations,

          · add pypy to dh's --with option, or:

          · call dh_pypy in the binary-* target,

   NOTES
   dependencies
       dh_pypy  tries  to  translate  Python  dependencies  from  requires.txt  file  to  Debian  dependencies.  Use
       debian/pypydist-overrides or --no-guessing-deps option to override it if the guess is incorrect. If you  want
       dh_pypy to generate more strict dependencies (f.e. to avoid ABI problems) create debian/pypy-foo.pydist file.
       See /usr/share/doc/dh-python/README.PyDist for more information. If the pydist file contains PEP386  flag  or
       set  of  (uscan  like)  rules, dh_pypy will make the depedency versioned (version requirements are ignored by
       default).

   private dirs
       /usr/share/foo, /usr/share/games/foo, /usr/lib/foo and /usr/lib/games/foo private directories are scanned for
       Python  files by default (where foo is binary package name). If your package is shipping Python files in some
       other directory, add another dh_pypy call in debian/rules with directory name as an argument -  you  can  use
       different  set of options in this call. If you need to change options for a private directory that is checked
       by default, invoke dh_pypy with --skip-private option and add another call with a path to this directory  and
       new options.

   debug packages
       In  binary  packages which name ends with -dbg, all files in /usr/lib/pypy/dist-packages/ directory that have
       extensions different than so or h are removed by default. Use --no-dbg-cleaning option to disable  this  fea‐
       ture.

   overriding supported / default PyPy versions
       If  you want to override system's list of supported PyPy versions or the default one (f.e. to build a package
       that includes symlinks for older version of PyPy or compile .py files only for  given  interpreter  version),
       you can do that via DEBPYPY_SUPPORTED and/or DEBPYPY_DEFAULT env. variables.

OPTIONS
       --version
              show program's version number and exit

       -h, --help
              show help message and exit

       --no-guessing-deps
              disable guessing dependencies

       --no-dbg-cleaning
              do not remove any files from debug packages

       --no-ext-rename do not add magic tags nor multiarch tuples to extension file names

       --no-shebang-rewrite
              do not rewrite shebangs

       --skip-private
              don't check private directories

       -v, --verbose
              turn verbose mode on

       -i, --indep
              act on architecture independent packages

       -a, --arch
              act on architecture dependent packages

       -q, --quiet
              be quiet

       -p PACKAGE, --package=PACKAGE
              act on the package named PACKAGE

       -N NO_PACKAGE, --no-package=NO_PACKAGE
              do not act on the specified package

       -X REGEXPR, --exclude=REGEXPR
              exclude  items  that match given REGEXPR. You may use this option multiple times to build up a list of
              things to exclude.

       --compile-all
              compile all files from given private directory in postinst/rtupdate not just the ones provided by  the
              package (i.e. do not pass the --package parameter to py3compile/py3clean)

       --depends=DEPENDS
              translate  given  requirements  into  Debian  dependencies and add them to ${pypy:Depends}. Use it for
              missing items in requires.txt

       --recommends=RECOMMENDS
              translate given requirements into Debian dependencies and add them to ${pypy:Recommends}

       --suggests=SUGGESTS
              translate given requirements into Debian dependencies and add them to ${pypy:Suggests}

       --requires=FILENAME
              translate requirements from given file(s) into Debian dependencies and add them to ${pypy:Depends}

       --shebang=COMMAND
              use given command as shebang in scripts

       --ignore-shebangs
              do not translate shebangs into Debian dependencies
