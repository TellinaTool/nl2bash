NAME
       grepdiff - show files modified by a diff containing a regex

SYNOPSIS
       grepdiff [[-n] | [--line-number]] [--number-files] [[-p n] | [--strip-match=n]] [--strip=n]
                [--addprefix=PREFIX] [--addoldprefix=PREFIX] [--addnewprefix=PREFIX] [[-s] | [--status]]
                [[-i PATTERN] | [--include=PATTERN]] [[-I FILE] | [--include-from-file=FILE]] [[-x PATTERN] |
                [--exclude=PATTERN]] [[-X FILE] | [--exclude-from-file=FILE]] [[-# RANGE] | [--hunks=RANGE]]
                [--lines=RANGE] [--files=RANGE] [--annotate] [--as-numbered-lines=WHEN] [--format=FORMAT]
                [--remove-timestamps] [[-v] | [--verbose]] [[-z] | [--decompress]] [[-E] | [--extended-regexp]]
                [[-H] | [--with-filename]] [[-h] | [--no-filename]] [--output-matching=WHAT] {[REGEX] | [-f FILE]}
                [file...]

       grepdiff {[--help] | [--version] | [--list] | [--filter ...]}

DESCRIPTION
       For each file modified by a patch, if the patch hunk contains the REGEX then the file's name is printed.

       The regular expression is treated as POSIX Basic Regular Expression syntax, unless the -E option is given in
       which case POSIX Extended Regular Expression syntax is used.

       For example, to see the patches in my.patch which contain the regular expression “pf_gfp_mask”, use:

           grepdiff pf_gfp_mask my.patch | \
             xargs -rn1 filterdiff my.patch -i

       You can use both unified and context format diffs with this program.

OPTIONS
       -n, --line-number
           Display the line number that each patch begins at. If verbose output is requested, each matching hunk is
           listed as well.

           For a description of the output format see lsdiff(1).

       --number-files
           File numbers are listed, beginning at 1, before each filename.

       -p n, --strip-match=n
           When matching, ignore the first n components of the pathname.

       --strip=n
           Remove the first n components of the pathname before displaying it.

       --addprefix=PREFIX
           Prefix the pathname with PREFIX before displaying it. This will override any individual settings
           specified with the --addoldprefix or --addnewprefix options.

       --addoldprefix=PREFIX
           Prefix pathnames for old or original files in the output by PREFIX.

       --addnewprefix=PREFIX
           Prefix pathnames for updated or new files in the output by PREFIX.

       -s
           Show file additions, modifications and removals. A file addition is indicated by a “+”, a removal by a
           “-”, and a modification by a “!”.

       -i PATTERN, --include=PATTERN
           Include only files matching PATTERN.

       -I FILE, --include-from-file=FILE
           Include only files matching any pattern listed in FILE, one pattern per line. All other lines in the
           input are suppressed.

       -x PATTERN --exclude=PATTERN
           Exclude files matching PATTERN.

       -X FILE, --exclude-from-file=FILE
           Exclude files matching any pattern listed in FILE, one pattern per line. All other lines in the input are
           displayed.

       -# RANGE, --hunks=RANGE
           Only include hunks within the specified RANGE. Hunks are numbered from 1, and the range is a
           comma-separated list of numbers or “first-last” spans; either the first or the last in the span may be
           omitted to indicate no limit in that direction.

       --lines=RANGE
           Only list hunks that contain lines from the original file that lie within the specified RANGE. Lines are
           numbered from 1, and the range is a comma-separated list of numbers or “first-last” spans; either the
           first or the last in the span may be omitted to indicate no limit in that direction.

       --files=RANGE
           Only list files indicated by the specified RANGE. Files are numbered from 1 in the order they appear in
           the patch input, and the range is a comma-separated list of numbers or “first-last” spans; either the
           first or the last in the span may be omitted to indicate no limit in that direction.

       --annotate
           Annotate each hunk with the filename and hunk number.

       --as-numbered-lines=before|after
           Instead of a patch fragment, display the lines of the selected hunks with the line number of the file
           before (or after) the patch is applied, followed by a TAB character and a colon, at the beginning of each
           line. Each hunk except the first will have a line consisting of “...”  before it.

       --format=unified|context
           Use specified output format.

       --remove-timestamps
           Do not include file timestamps in the output.

       -z, --decompress
           Decompress files with extensions .gz and .bz2.

       -E, --extended-regexp
           Use POSIX Extended Regular Expression syntax.

       -H, --with-filename
           Print the name of the patch file containing each match.

       -h, --no-filename
           Suppress the name of the patch file containing each match.

       -f FILE, --file=FILE
           Read regular expressions from FILE, one per line.

       --output-matching=hunk|file
           Display the matching hunk-level or file-level diffs.

       --help
           Display a short usage message.

       --version
           Display the version number of grepdiff.

       --filter
           Behave like filterdiff(1) instead.

       --list
           Behave like lsdiff(1) instead.
