NAME
       foo2hbpl2-wrapper - Convert Postscript into a ZJS printer stream

SYNOPSIS
       foo2hbpl2-wrapper [options] [ps-file]

DESCRIPTION
       foo2hbpl2-wrapper  is  a  Foomatic  compatible printer wrapper for the foo2hbpl2 printer driver.  This script
       reads a Postscript ps-file or standard input and converts it to  Zenographics  ZjStream  printer  format  for
       driving  the  Dell  1355,  Dell C1765, Epson AcuLaser M1400, Fuji Xerox DocuPrint CM205, Fuji Xerox DocuPrint
       P205, Xerox WorkCentre 3045 MFP, and Xerox WorkCentre 6015 MFP printers.

       This script can be used in a standalone fashion, but is intended to be called from a printer  spooler  system
       which uses the Foomatic printer database.

   Printer Tweaking Options
       These are the options used to customize the operation of foo2hbpl2 for a particular printer.

       -u xoffxyoff
              Set the offset of the start of the printable region from the upper left corner, in pixels [varies with
              paper size].  The defaults should work on the 2200DL and 2300DL, and have not been tested on any other
              printers.

       -l xoffxyoff
              Set the offset of the end of the printable region from the lower right corner, in pixels [varies  with
              paper size].  The defaults should work on the 2200DL and 2300DL, and have not been tested on any other
              printers.

       -L mask
              Send the logical clipping values from -u/-l in the ZjStream.   foo2hbpl2-wrapper  always  runs  Ghost‐
              script  with  the ideal page dimensions, so that the scale of the image is correct, regardless whether
              or not the printer has unprintable regions.  This option is used to move the position of  the  clipped
              image back to where it belongs on the page.  The default is to send the amount which was clipped by -u
              and -l, and should be good in most cases.

              0   don't send any logical clipping amounts
              1   only send Y clipping amount
              2   only send X clipping amount
              3   send both X and Y clipping amounts

       -P     Do not send START_PLANE codes on monochrome output.  May be needed by some  monochrome-only  printers,
              such as the HP LaserJet 1000.

       -X padlen
              Add  extra  zero  padding  to  the end of BID segments.  The default is 16 bytes.  Padding 16 bytes of
              zeroes is needed for older ZjStream printers, such as the Minolta 2200DL and  HP  LaserJet  1000,  and
              seems  harmless  to  newer  ones,  such  as the Minolta 2300DL.  So the default should be good for all
              cases.

   Color Tweaking Options
       These are the options used to control the quality of color output.  Color correction is currently a  WORK  IN
       PROGRESS.

       -g gsopts
              Additional  options  to pass to Ghostscript, such as -g“-dDITHERPPI=nnn”, etc.  This option may appear
              more than once.

       -G profile.icm
              Convert profile.icm to a Postscript color rendering dictionary (CRD) using foo2zjs-icc2ps  and  adjust
              the printer colors by using the Postscript setcolorrendering operator.  (WORK IN PROGRESS).

       -G gamma-file.ps
              Prepend  gamma-file.ps  to the Postscript input to perform color correction using the setcolortransfer
              Postscript operator.  For example, the file might contain:
              {0.333 exp} {0.333 exp} {0.333 exp} {0.333 exp} setcolortransfer

       -I intent
              Select profile intent from the ICM  file.   0=Perceptual,  1=Colorimetric,  2=Saturation,  3=Absolute.
              Default is 0 (perceptual).

   Debugging Options
       These options are used for debugging foo2hbpl2 and its wrapper.

       -S plane
              Output  just  a single color plane from a color print and print it on the black plane.  The default is
              to output all color planes.

              1   Cyan
              2   Magenta
              3   Yellow
              4   Black

       -D level
              Set Debug level [0].


EXAMPLES
       Create a monochrome ZjStream from a Postscript document, examine it, and then print  it  using  a  RAW  print
       queue:

              foo2hbpl2-wrapper testpage.ps > testpage.prn
              hbpl2decode < testpage.prn
              lpr -P raw testpage.prn

       Create a color ZjStream stream from a Postscript document:

              foo2hbpl2-wrapper -c testpage.ps > testpage.prn
