DESCRIPTION
       Xrandr  is  used  to set the size, orientation and/or reflection of the outputs for a screen. It can also set
       the screen size.

       If invoked without any option, it will dump the state of the outputs, showing the existing modes for each  of
       them, with a '+' after the preferred modes and a '*' after the current mode.

       There  are a few global options. Other options modify the last output that is specified in earlier parameters
       in the command line. Multiple outputs may be modified at the same time by passing multiple  --output  options
       followed immediately by their corresponding modifying options.

       --help Print out a summary of the usage and exit.

       -v, --version
              Print out the RandR version reported by the X server and exit.

       --verbose
              Causes  xrandr  to  be more verbose. When used with -q (or without other options), xrandr will display
              more information about the server state. Please note that the gamma and  brightness  informations  are
              only  approximations  of the complete color profile stored in the server. When used along with options
              that reconfigure the system, progress will be reported while executing the configuration changes.

       -q, --query
              When this option is present, or when no configuration changes are requested, xrandr will  display  the
              current state of the system.

       --dryrun
              Performs all the actions specified except that no changes are made.

       --nograb
              Apply  the modifications without grabbing the screen. It avoids to block other applications during the
              update but it might also cause some applications that detect screen resize to receive old values.

       -d, --display name
              This option selects the X display to use. Note this refers to the X screen abstraction, not the  moni‐
              tor (or output).

       --screen snum
              This  option selects which screen to manipulate. Note this refers to the X screen abstraction, not the
              monitor (or output).

       --q1   Forces the usage of the RandR version 1.1 protocol, even if a higher version is available.

       --q12  Forces the usage of the RandR version 1.2 protocol, even if the display does not  report  it  as  sup‐
              ported or a higher version is available.

RandR version 1.4 options
       Options for RandR 1.4 are used as a superset of the options for RandR 1.3.

       --listproviders
              Report information about the providers available.

       --setprovideroutputsource provider source
              Set  source  as the source of display output images for provider.  This is only possible if source and
              provider have the Source Output and Sink Output capabilities, respectively.

       --setprovideroffloadsink provider sink
              Set provider as a render offload device for sink.  This is only possible if provider and sink have the
              Source Offload and Sink Offload capabilities, respectively.

RandR version 1.3 options
       Options for RandR 1.3 are used as a superset of the options for RandR 1.2.

       --current
              Return the current screen configuration, without polling for hardware changes.

       --noprimary
              Don't define a primary output.

       Per-output options

       --panning            widthxheight[+x+y[/track_widthxtrack_height+track_x+track_y[/border_left/border_top/bor‐
       der_right/border_bottom]]]
              This option sets the panning parameters.  As soon as panning is enabled, the CRTC position can  change
              with  every pointer move.  The first four parameters specify the total panning area, the next four the
              pointer tracking area (which defaults to the same area). The last four parameters specify  the  border
              and  default to 0. A width or height set to zero disables panning on the according axis. You typically
              have to set the screen size with --fb simultaneously.

       --transform a,b,c,d,e,f,g,h,i
              Specifies a transformation matrix to apply on the output. Automatically a bilinear filter is selected.
              The mathematical form corresponds to:
                     a b c
                     d e f
                     g h i
              The transformation is based on homogeneous coordinates. The matrix multiplied by the coordinate vector
              of a pixel of the output gives the transformed coordinate vector of a pixel  in  the  graphic  buffer.
              More  precisely, the vector (x y) of the output pixel is extended to 3 values (x y w), with 1 as the w
              coordinate and multiplied against the matrix. The final device coordinates of the pixel are then  cal‐
              culated  with  the  so-called homogenic division by the transformed w coordinate.  In other words, the
              device coordinates (x' y') of the transformed pixel are:
                     x' = (ax + by + c) / w'   and
                     y' = (dx + ey + f) / w'   ,
                     with  w' = (gx + hy + i)  .
              Typically, a and e corresponds to the scaling on the X and Y axes, c and f corresponds to the transla‐
              tion  on  those  axes,  and  g,  h,  and i are respectively 0, 0 and 1. The matrix can also be used to
              express more complex transformations such as keystone correction, or rotation.  For a rotation  of  an
              angle T, this formula can be used:
                     cos T  -sin T   0
                     sin T   cos T   0
                      0       0      1
              As  a  special  argument, instead of passing a matrix, one can pass the string none, in which case the
              default values are used (a unit matrix without filter).

       --scale xxy
              Changes the dimensions of the output picture. Values superior to 1 will lead to  a  compressed  screen
              (screen dimension bigger than the dimension of the output mode), and values below 1 leads to a zoom in
              on the output. This option is actually a shortcut version of the --transform option.

       --scale-from wxh
              Specifies the size in pixels of the area of the framebuffer to be  displayed  on  this  output.   This
              option is actually a shortcut version of the --transform option.

       --primary
              Set the output as primary.  It will be sorted first in Xinerama and RANDR geometry requests.

RandR version 1.2 options
       These options are only available for X server supporting RandR version 1.2 or newer.

       --prop, --properties
              This  option  causes  xrandr  to  display  the  contents of properties for each output. --verbose also
              enables --prop.

       --fb widthxheight
              Reconfigures the screen to the specified size. All configured monitors must fit within this size. When
              this  option  is not provided, xrandr computes the smallest screen size that will hold the set of con‐
              figured outputs; this option provides a way to override that behaviour.

       --fbmm widthxheight
              Sets the reported values for the physical size of the screen. Normally,  xrandr  resets  the  reported
              physical size values to keep the DPI constant.  This overrides that computation.

       --dpi dpi
              This  also  sets  the  reported physical size values of the screen, it uses the specified DPI value to
              compute an appropriate physical size using whatever pixel size will be set.

       --newmode name mode
              New modelines can be added to the server and then associated with outputs.  This option does the  for‐
              mer.  The  mode  is specified using the ModeLine syntax for xorg.conf: clock hdisp hsyncstart hsyncend
              htotal vdisp vsyncstart vsyncend vtotal flags. flags can be zero or more of  +HSync,  -HSync,  +VSync,
              -VSync,  Interlace, DoubleScan, CSync, +CSync, -CSync. Several tools permit to compute the usual mode‐
              line from a height, width, and refresh rate, for instance you can use cvt.

       --rmmode name
              This removes a mode from the server if it is otherwise unused.

       --addmode output name
              Add a mode to the set of valid modes for an output.

       --delmode output name
              Remove a mode from the set of valid modes for an output.

       Per-output options

       --output output
              Selects an output to reconfigure. Use either the name of the output or the XID.

       --auto For connected but disabled outputs, this will enable them using their first preferred mode (or,  some‐
              thing  close to 96dpi if they have no preferred mode). For disconnected but enabled outputs, this will
              disable them.

       --mode mode
              This selects a mode. Use either the name or the XID for mode

       --preferred
              This selects the same mode as --auto, but it doesn't automatically enable or disable the output.

       --pos xxy
              Position the output within the screen using pixel coordinates.  In  case  reflection  or  rotation  is
              applied, the translation is applied after the effects.

       --rate rate
              This  marks  a preference for refresh rates close to the specified value, when multiple modes have the
              same name, this will select the one with the nearest refresh rate.

       --reflect reflection
              Reflection can be one of 'normal' 'x', 'y' or 'xy'. This causes the output contents  to  be  reflected
              across the specified axes.

       --rotate rotation
              Rotation  can be one of 'normal', 'left', 'right' or 'inverted'. This causes the output contents to be
              rotated in the specified direction. 'right' specifies a clockwise rotation of the picture  and  'left'
              specifies a counter-clockwise rotation.

       --left-of, --right-of, --above, --below, --same-as another-output
              Use  one  of  these  options  to  position the output relative to the position of another output. This
              allows convenient tiling of outputs within the screen.  The position is always  computed  relative  to
              the  new  position  of  the  other output, so it is not valid to say --output a --left-of b --output b
              --left-of a.

       --set property value
              Sets an output property. Integer properties may be specified as a valid (see  --prop)  comma-separated
              list  of  decimal or hexadecimal (with a leading 0x) values.  Atom properties may be set to any of the
              valid atoms (see --prop).  String properties may be set to any value.

       --off  Disables the output.

       --crtc crtc
              Uses the specified crtc (either as an index in the list of CRTCs  or  XID).   In  normal  usage,  this
              option is not required as xrandr tries to make sensible choices about which crtc to use with each out‐
              put. When that fails for some reason, this option can override the normal selection.

       --gamma red:green:blue
              Set the specified floating point values as gamma correction on the crtc  currently  attached  to  this
              output.  Note  that you cannot get two different values for cloned outputs (i.e.: which share the same
              crtc) and that switching an output to another crtc doesn't change the crtc gamma corrections at all.

       --brightness brightness
              Multiply the gamma values on the crtc currently attached to the output to  specified  floating  value.
              Useful  for  overly  bright  or overly dim outputs.  However, this is a software only modification, if
              your hardware has support to actually change the brightness, you will probably prefer  to  use  xback‐
              light.

RandR version 1.1 options
       These  options  are  available  for X servers supporting RandR version 1.1 or older. They are still valid for
       newer X servers, but they don't interact sensibly with version 1.2 options on the same command line.

       -s, --size size-index or --size widthxheight
              This sets the screen size, either matching by size or using the  index  into  the  list  of  available
              sizes.

       -r, --rate, --refresh rate
              This sets the refresh rate closest to the specified value.

       -o, --orientation rotation
              This specifies the orientation of the screen, and can be one of normal, inverted, left or right.

       -x     Reflect across the X axis.

       -y     Reflect across the Y axis.

EXAMPLES
       Sets an output called LVDS to its preferred mode, and on its right put an output called VGA to preferred mode
       of a screen which has been physically rotated clockwise:
              xrandr --output LVDS --auto --rotate normal --pos 0x0 --output VGA  --auto  --rotate  left  --right-of
              LVDS

       Forces to use a 1024x768 mode on an output called VGA:
              xrandr --newmode "1024x768" 63.50  1024 1072 1176 1328  768 771 775 798 -hsync +vsync
              xrandr --addmode VGA 1024x768
              xrandr --output VGA --mode 1024x768

       Enables panning on a 1600x768 desktop while displaying 1024x768 mode on an output called VGA:
              xrandr --fb 1600x768 --output VGA --mode 1024x768 --panning 1600x0

       Have  one  small 1280x800 LVDS screen showing a small version of a huge 3200x2000 desktop, and have a big VGA
       screen display the surrounding of the mouse at normal size.
              xrandr  --fb  3200x2000  --output  LVDS   --scale   2.5x2.5   --output   VGA   --pos   0x0   --panning
              3200x2000+0+0/3200x2000+0+0/64/64/64/64

       Displays  the  VGA  output in trapezoid shape so that it is keystone corrected when the projector is slightly
       above the screen:
              xrandr --fb 1024x768 --output VGA --transform 1.24,0.16,-124,0,1.24,0,0,0.000316,1
