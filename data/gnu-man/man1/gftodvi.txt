GFTODVI(1)                                     General Commands Manual                                    GFTODVI(1)



NAME
       gftodvi - make proof sheets from generic font files

SYNOPSIS
       gftodvi [-overflow-label-offset=real] [-verbose] gf_file_name

DESCRIPTION
       This  manual  page  is not meant to be exhaustive.  The complete documentation for this version of TeX can be
       found in the info file or manual Web2C: A TeX implementation.

       The gftodvi program converts a generic font (gf) file output by, for example, mf(1), to a device  independent
       (DVI)  file  (that  can  then  be typeset using the same software that has already been written for TeX). The
       characters in the gf file will appear one per page, with labels, titles, and annotations as specified in  Ap‐
       pendix H (Hardcopy Proofs) of The Metafontbook.

       gftodvi  uses  other fonts in addition to the main gf file.  A `gray' font is used to typeset the pixels that
       actually make up the character. (We wouldn't want all the pixels to be simply black, since then  labels,  key
       points,  and  other information would be lost.)  A `title' font is used for the information at the top of the
       page. A `label' font is used for the labels on key points of the figure. A `slant' font is  used  to  typeset
       diagonal  lines, which otherwise have to be simulated using horizontal and vertical rules.  The default gray,
       title, and label fonts are gray, cmr8, and cmtt10, respectively; there is no default slant font.

       To change the default fonts, you can give special commands in your Metafont source file, or  you  can  change
       the fonts online. An online dialog ensues if you end the gf_file_name with a `/'. For example,
         gftodvi cmr10.300gf/
         Special font substitution: grayfont black
         OK; any more? grayfontarea /home/art/don/
         OK; any more? slantfont /home/fonts/slantimagen6
         OK; any more? <RET>
       will  use  /home/art/don/black as the `gray' font and /home/fonts/slantimagen6 as the `slant' font (this name
       indicates a font for lines with slope 1/6 at the resolution of an Imagen printer).

       The gf_file_name on the command line must be complete.  Because the resolution is part of the  extension,  it
       would  not  make  sense to append a default extension as is done with TeX or DVI-reading software. The output
       file name uses the same root as the gf file, with the .dvi extension  added.  For  example,  the  input  file
       cmr10.2602gf would become cmr10.dvi.

OPTIONS
       The  argument  to -overflow-label-offset specifies the distance from the right edge of the character bounding
       box at which the overflow equations (if any) are typeset.  The value is given in TeX points.  The default  is
       a little over two inches.

       Without the -verbose option, gftodvi operates silently.  With it, a banner and progress report are printed on
       stdout.

ENVIRONMENT
       gftodvi looks for gf_file_name using the environment variable GFFONTS.  If that is not set, it uses the vari‐
       able TEXFONTS. If that is not set, it uses the system default.

       See tex(1) for the details of the searching.

FILES
       {gray.tfm,...}
              The default fonts.

       {gray.mf,...}
              The Metafont sources.
