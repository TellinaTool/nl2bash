ppmquantall(1)                                 General Commands Manual                                ppmquantall(1)



NAME
       ppmquantall - run ppmquant on a bunch of files all at once, so they share a common colormap


SYNOPSIS
       ppmquantall [-ext extension] ncolors ppmfile ...


DESCRIPTION
       Takes  a bunch of portable pixmap as input.  Chooses ncolors colors to best represent all of the images, maps
       the existing colors to the new ones, and overwrites the input files with the new quantized versions.

       If you don't want to overwrite your input files, use the -ext option.  The output files are  then  named  the
       same as the input files, plus a period and the extension text you specify.

       Verbose  explanation:  Let's say you've got a dozen pixmaps that you want to display on the screen all at the
       same time.  Your screen can only display 256 different colors, but the pixmaps have a total of a thousand  or
       so  different  colors.   For  a single pixmap you solve this problem with ppmquant; this script solves it for
       multiple pixmaps.  All it does is concatenate them together into one big pixmap, run ppmquant  on  that,  and
       then split it up into little pixmaps again.

       (Note  that  another  way to solve this problem is to pre-select a set of colors and then use ppmquant's -map
       option to separately quantize each pixmap to that set.)
