ssh-import-id(1)                                     ssh-import                                     ssh-import-id(1)



NAME
       ssh-import-id  -  retrieve  one  or  more  public keys from a public keyserver and append them to the current
       user's authorized_keys file (or some other specified file)


SYNOPSIS
       ssh-import-id [options] USER_ID_1 [gh:USER_ID_2] ... [lp:USER_ID_n]

       ssh-import-id-lp USER_ID_1 [USER_ID_2] ... [USER_ID_n]

       ssh-import-id-gh USER_ID_1 [USER_ID_2] ... [USER_ID_n]


OPTIONS
        -h | --help        usage
        -o | --output F    write output to file 'F' (default ~/.ssh/authorized_keys, use "-" for standard out)
        -r | --remove      remove keys from authorized keys file 'F'
        PROTO:USER_ID      Protocol can be 'lp' for Launchpad.net, or 'gh' for Github.com


DESCRIPTION
       This utility will securely contact a public keyserver and retrieve one or more user's public keys, and append
       these to the current user's ~/.ssh/authorized_keys file, standard output or any other specified output file.

       User IDs can be prepended by a protocol:

        - lp: to use https://launchpad.net/~%s/+sshkeys
        - gh: to use https://api.github.com/users/%s/keys

       If  the  protocol  is  not  explicitly  specified,  then  ssh-import-id  will read a URL variable string from
       /etc/ssh/ssh_import_id as installed by your package manager and configured by your system administrator.  You
       can  override  this  locally by exporting the string you want in a URL environment variable.  If all of these
       are empty, then the protocol is assumed to be "lp:", which was the original  target  implementation  of  this
       tool.

       Any keys added will be "labled" with a trailing comment, "# ssh-import-id PROTO:USER_ID".  Revoking keys will
       first look for lines in the authorized keys file ending with that label.
