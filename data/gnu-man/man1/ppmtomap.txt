NAME
       ppmtomap - extract all colors from a portable pixmap


DESCRIPTION
       This program exists only for backward compatibility.

       Use pnmcolormap, which replaced it in January 2002.

       One  trivial  difference  between  ppmtomap  and pnmcolormap all is that if the input is PBM or PGM, ppmtomap
       would produce PPM output, whereas pnmcolormap all produces the same kind of output as the input.  This should
       not be very noticeable, though, as PBM and PGM images are usually usable anywhere a PPM image is.
