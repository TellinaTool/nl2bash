NAME
       zeitgeist-datahub - passive loggers for Zeitgeist


SYNOPSIS
       zeitgeist-datahub [OPTION]


DESCRIPTION
       zeitgeist-datahub  is  a  daemon which centralizes all passive data sources into a single process, and inter‐
       faces between said data sources (also known as loggers) and zeitgeist-daemon (with which it communicates  via
       D-Bus).

       Passive  data sources are those which run in the background and look for activities independently to the pro‐
       grams they monitor, whereas Zeitgeist can also work with active data sources which are  those  in-build  into
       other applications (either natively or through extensions).


OPTIONS
       The  program  follows the usual GNU command line syntax, with options starting with two dashes (`--'). A sum‐
       mary of options is included below.

       Currently there are no options available.
