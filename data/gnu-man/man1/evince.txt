DESCRIPTION
       evince

       Evince is a document viewer capable of displaying multiple and single page  document  formats  like  PDF  and
       Postscript.     For    more    general    information    about   Evince   please   visit   our   website   at
       http://www.gnome.org/projects/evince/


OPTIONS
       -?, -h, --help
              Prints the command line options.

       -p, --page-label=PAGE
              Open the document on the page with the specified page label (or page number).

       -i, --page-index=NUMBER
              Open the document on the page with the specified page index (this is the exact page number, not a page
              label).

       -n, --named-dest=DEST
              Open the document on the specified named destination.

       -f, --fullscreen
              Run evince in fullscreen mode.

       -s, --presentation
              Run evince in presentation mode.

       -l, --find=string
              You  can  pass  a  word  or  phrase here. If it exists, evince will display the document and the first
              match.

       filename(s)...
              Specifies the file to open when Evince starts. If this is not specified, Evince will open a blank win‐
              dow.  Multiple  files can be loaded if they are separated by spaces.  Evince also supports handling of
              remote files.  For example, you can pass the location on the web or load a file  from  a  FTP  server,
              like "ftp://adobe.com/sample.pdf".


Print preview options
       These options are primarily intended for use with the GTK+ print preview function. For more information about
       these options see http://developer.gnome.org/gtk3/stable/GtkSettings.html#GtkSettings--gtk-print-preview-com‐
       mand

       -w, --preview
              Run evince as a previewer.

       --unlink-temp-file
              If evince is run in preview mode, this will unlink the temporary file created by GTK+.

       --print-settings %s %f
              This sends the full path of the PDF file, f, and the settings of the print dialog, s, to evince.
