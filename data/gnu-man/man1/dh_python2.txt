DH_PYTHON2(1)                                                                                          DH_PYTHON2(1)



NAME
       dh_python2 - calculates Python dependencies, adds maintainer scripts to byte compile files, etc.

SYNOPSIS
          dh_python2 -p PACKAGE [-V [X.Y][-][A.B]] DIR_OR_FILE [-X REGEXPR]

DESCRIPTION
   QUICK GUIDE FOR MAINTAINERS
          · if necessary, describe supported Python versions via X-Python-Version field in debian/control,

          · build-depend on python or python-all or python-all-dev (>= 2.6.6-3~),

          · build module/application using its standard build system, remember to build extensions for all supported
            Python versions (loop over pyversions -vr),

          · install files to the standard locations, add --install-layout=deb to setup.py's install command if  your
            package is using distutils,

          · add python2 to dh's --with option, or:

          · include /usr/share/cdbs/1/class/python-distutils.mk in debian/rules and depend on cdbs (>= 0.4.90), or:

          · call dh_python2 in the binary-* target,

          · add ${python:Depends} to Depends

   NOTES
       In  order to support more than one Python version in the same binary package, dh_python2 (unlike dh_pycentral
       and dh_pysupport) creates symlinks to all supported Python versions  at  build  time.  It  means  binNMU  (or
       sourceful  upload  in  case of architecture independent packages) is required once a list of supported Python
       version is changed. It's faster and more robust than its competitors, though.

   dependencies
       dh_python2 tries to translate  Python  dependencies  from  requires.txt  file  to  Debian  dependencies.  Use
       debian/pydist-overrides  or  --no-guessing-deps  option to override it if the guess is incorrect. If you want
       dh_python2 to generate more strict dependencies (f.e. to avoid ABI problems) create  debian/python-foo.pydist
       file.  See  /usr/share/doc/python-doc/README.PyDist (provided by python-doc package) for more information. If
       the pydist file contains PEP386 flag or set of (uscan like) rules, dh_python2 will make  the  depedency  ver‐
       sioned (version requirements are ignored by default).

   namespace feature
       dh_python2  parses  Egg's  namespace_packages.txt files (in addition to --namespace command line argument(s))
       and drops empty __init__.py files from binary package. pycompile will regenerate them  at  install  time  and
       pyclean  will  remove  them at uninstall time (if they're no longer used in installed packages). It's still a
       good idea to provide __init__.py file in one of binary packages (even if all other  packages  use  this  fea‐
       ture).

   private dirs
       /usr/share/foo, /usr/share/games/foo, /usr/lib/foo and /usr/lib/games/foo private directories are scanned for
       Python files by default (where foo is binary package name). If your package is shipping Python files in  some
       other directory, add another dh_python2 call in debian/rules with directory name as an argument - you can use
       different set of options in this call. If you need to change options (f.e. a list of  supported  Python  ver‐
       sions)  for  a private directory that is checked by default, invoke dh_python2 with --skip-private option and
       add another call with a path to this directory and new options.

   debug packages
       In binary packages which name ends with -dbg, all files in /usr/lib/python2.X/{site,dist}-packages/ directory
       that  have extensions different than so or h are removed by default.  Use --no-dbg-cleaning option to disable
       this feature.

   pyinstall files
       Files listed in debian/pkg.pyinstall file will be installed as public modules for all requested  Python  ver‐
       sions (dh_install doesn't know about python's site- vs. dist-packages issue).

       Syntax: path/to/file [VERSION_RANGE] [NAMESPACE]

       debian directory is automatically removed from the path, so you can place your files in debian/ directory and
       install them from this location (if you want to install them in "debian" namespace, set NAMESPACE to debian).
       If NAMESPACE is set, all listed files will be installed in .../dist-packages/NAMESPACE/ directory.

       Examples:

              · foo.py installs .../dist-packages/foo.py for all supported Python versions

              · foo/bar.py 2.6- installs .../dist-packages/foo/bar.py for versions >= 2.6

              · foo/bar.py spam installs .../dist-packages/spam/bar.py

              · debian/*.py spam.egg 2.5 installs .../python2.5/site-packages/spam/egg/*.py files

   pyremove files
       If you want to remove some files installed by build system (from all supported Python versions or only from a
       subset of these versions), add them to debian/pkg.pyremove file.

       Examples:

              · *.pth removes .pth files from .../dist-packages/

              · bar/baz.py 2.5 removes .../python2.5/site-packages/bar/baz.py

   overriding supported / default Python versions
       If you want to override system's list of supported Python versions or the default one (f.e. to build a  pack‐
       age  that  includes symlinks for older version of Python or compile .py files only for given interpreter ver‐
       sion), you can do that via DEBPYTHON_SUPPORTED and/or DEBPYTHON_DEFAULT env. variables.

       Example: 2.5,2.7 limits the list of supported Python versions to Python 2.5 and Python 2.7.

       --no-shebang-rewrite
              do not rewrite shebangs

       --skip-private
              don't check private directories

       -v, --verbose
              turn verbose mode on

       -i, --indep
              act on architecture independent packages

       -a, --arch
              act on architecture dependent packages

       -q, --quiet
              be quiet

       -p PACKAGE, --package=PACKAGE
              act on the package named PACKAGE

       -N NO_PACKAGE, --no-package=NO_PACKAGE
              do not act on the specified package

       -V VRANGE
              specify list of supported Python versions. See pycompile(1) for examples

       -X REGEXPR, --exclude=REGEXPR
              exclude items that match given REGEXPR. You may use this option multiple times to build up a  list  of
              things to exclude.

       --compile-all
              compile  all files from given private directory in postinst/rtupdate not just the ones provided by the
              package (i.e. do not pass the --package parameter to pycompile/pyclean)

       --depends=DEPENDS
              translate given requirements into Debian dependencies and add them to ${python:Depends}.  Use  it  for
              missing items in requires.txt

       --recommends=RECOMMENDS
              translate given requirements into Debian dependencies and add them to ${python:Recommends}

       --ignore-namespace
              ignore  Egg's  namespace  declaration  and  --namespace option. This option will disable removing (and
              recreating at install time) empty __init__.py files.  Removing  namespace_packages.txt  from  egg-info
              directory has the same effect.

       --shebang=COMMAND
              use given command as shebang in scripts

       --ignore-shebangs
              do not translate shebangs into Debian dependencies
