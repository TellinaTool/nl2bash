NAME
       apport-unpack - extract the fields of a problem report to separate files


SYNOPSIS
       apport-unpack report target-directory


DESCRIPTION
       A  problem report, as produced by apport is a single file with a set of key/value pairs in the RFC822 syntax.
       This tool disassembles a report such that the value of each entry is written into a separate file,  with  the
       key as file name. This is particularly useful for large binary data like the core dump.

       report is either a path to an existing apport crash report, or '-' to read from stdin.

       The target-directory must either be nonexisting or empty.
