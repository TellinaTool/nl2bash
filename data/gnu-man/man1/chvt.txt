NAME
       chvt - change foreground virtual terminal

SYNOPSIS
       chvt N

DESCRIPTION
       The  command  chvt N makes /dev/ttyN the foreground terminal.  (The corresponding screen is created if it did
       not exist yet.  To get rid of unused VTs, use deallocvt(1).)  The key combination (Ctrl-)LeftAlt-FN  (with  N
       in the range 1-12) usually has a similar effect.
