NAME
       dh_installtex - register Type 1 fonts, hyphenation patterns, or formats with TeX

SYNOPSIS
       dh_installtex [debhelper options] [-n] [--priority=n] [--flavor=flavor[,flavor]] [map=MixedMap,file.map]
       [map=Map,file.map] [map=KanjiMap,file.map] [mapfile=file.cfg[=n]]
       [hyphen=lang,file[,lhm=n][,rhm=n][,synonym=syn,...]]  [hyphenfile=file.cnf[=n]]
       [format=format,engine,hyphenfile,rest args] [formatfile=file.cnf[=n]]

DESCRIPTION
       dh_installtex is a debhelper program that is responsible for updating the ls-R databases, registering map
       files, new formats, and new hyphenation patterns with TeX.

       Your package should depend on an appropriate version of tex-common so that the update-* commands are
       available. (This program adds that dependency to ${misc:Depends}.)

       WARNING This program does not check for the actual existence of any input files in TEXMF trees. If you call
       it without any further specification on which packages to work on (using "-p" or "-N") it will add calls to
       management functions to all packages. In this case don't forget to add ${misc:Depends} to all packages'
       dependencies.

SIMPLE USAGE: Registering Files
       If you only install files into /usr/share/texmf and want to be sure that mktexlsr is called in a correct way
       (e.g., also in the postrm script when there is no functional mktexlsr), simply call

               dh_installtex

COMPLEX USAGE: Registering fonts, hyphenation patterns and formats
       If in addition, you have to install map files, hyphenation patterns for additional languages, or format
       definitions you can use three different methods to specify what should be installed:

       1) Pre made config files: These files can be specified with the different typefile= options, together with an
       optional priority.  type can be one of map, format and hyphen, and these files will be installed into
       /etc/texmf/configdir/ for the respective type (updmap.d for map files, hyphen.d for hyphenation pattern
       files, and fmt.d for format files).

       Example:

               dh_installtex mapfile=foo.cfg formatfile=debian/bar.cnf=42

       would install foo.cfg as /var/lib/tex-common/fontmap-cfg/texmf/foo.cfg, and debian/bar.cnf as
       /etc/texmf/fmt.d/42bar.cnf.

       2) Directly on the cmd line: You can specify maps, formats, and hyphenations on the cmd line. The items are
       stored in the respective config file 20package

       Example:

               dh_installtex map=Map,foo.map hyphen=ngerman-x-2011-07-01,dehyphn-x-2011-07-01.tex,hyph-de-1996.pat.txt,lhm=2,rhm=2,synonym=ngerman-x-latest,exceptions=hyph-de-1996.hyp.txt

       would install a file /var/lib/tex-common/fontmap-cfg/texmf/package.cfg containing the line

               Map foo.map

       and a file /etc/texmf/hyphen.d/20package.cnf containing the lines

           name=ngerman-x-2011-07-01 file=dehyphn-x-2011-07-01.tex file_patterns=hyph-de-1996.pat.txt lefthyphenmin=2 righthyphenmin=2 synonym=ngerman-x-latest file_exceptions=hyph-de-1996.hyp.txt

       3) Package files: You create a file debian/package.maps or debian/maps, debian/package.hyphens or
       debian/hyphens, debian/package.formats or debian/formats. These files are installed with default priority and
       the name of the package. Each of these files will be installed into the first package dh_installtex is told
       to act on. By default this is the first binary package in debian/control, but if you use -p, -i, or -a flags,
       it will be the first package specified by those flags.

       Example:

               dh_installtex

       would install a present debian/package.formats file as /etc/texmf/fmt.d/20package.cnf.

   Mixing the different variants
       The command line items (Variant 2) are merged into the debian/package.maps (debian/package.hyphens,
       debian/package.formats) file and the merged file is installed as 20package.cfg/cnf. If you specify an
       additional package.cfg/cnf (Variant 1) without a different priority than the default one on the cmd line,
       this will raise an error since both files would be installed as 20package.cfg/cnf. You can only specify
       package.cfg/cnf without a different priority than the default one if no debian/package.maps nor any command
       line Map files are present.

   The pseudo-comment
       If the provided cfg files do not contain the pseudo-comment as described in the Debian TeX Policy, Font
       configuration, an additional header with explanation, warning and the pseudo-comment is added.

       This program automatically generates the postinst and postrm commands needed to register the fonts with TeX.
       See dh_installdeb(1) for an explanation of how this works.

OPTIONS
       -n, --noscripts
           Do not modify postinst/prerm scripts.

       --priority=n
           Set the default priority to n instead of 20.

       --flavor=flavor[,flavor]
           This option is used to select a different tree then the default /usr/share/texmf, and to switch on
           additional options. The argument specify a list from flavors to be selected.  At the moment you can
           select from the following list of flavors: tree:texlive, map:config_for_active_maps,
           map:config_for_all_maps, format:build_all, format:add_one:formatname, and lsr:full.

           tree:texlive will select the tree /usr/share/texlive/texmf-dist and should only be used for files
           installed into this tree.

           map:config_for_active_maps will create a file config.bar for each active (i.e. uncommented) map in each
           of the cfg file generated by one of the three methods described above. These files are installed in
           /usr/share/texmf/dvips/config/.

           If you select map:config_for_all_maps the script will generate config.bar even for those map files which
           are present in a cfg file, but deactivated by a comment.

           The file config.bar is used when called by `dvips -Pbar ...'. Thus it allows the activation of single map
           files even if they are not automatically activated via the updmap(-sys) mechanism.

           Default is not to generate any config files.

           format:build_all will add code to the postinst script to create all defined formats, and to the postrm
           script to clean and recreate? FIXME?  the generated formats.

           format:add_one:formatname allows to add the generation of a specific format without actually providing it
           (in a cnf file).  This is useful if a package adds hyphenation patterns to an existing formats.

           format:no_links: Usually, for every format that is specified in a configuration file in
           /etc/texmf/fmt.d/, dh_installtex will create a symlink /usr/bin/format that points to the corresponding
           engine.  For example, /usr/bin/latex would be created as a symlink to pdftex.

           The flavor format:no_links inhibits this. If a link already exists, dh_installtex will skip this format
           with an informational message, even if this option is not given.

           lsr:full: Recreate the lsr database not only for the standard trees, but also the distribution tree
           "/usr/share/texlive/texmf" and "/usr/share/texlive/texmf-dist".

NOTES
       "dh_installtex" adds a dependency relation onto tex-common to misc:Depends.  If files are installed into
       /usr/share/texmf/doc, the version is >=4, otherwise >=3.

       Note that this command is not idempotent. "dh_clean -k" should be called between invocations of this command,
       unless using the -n option.  Otherwise, it may cause multiple instances of the same text to be added to
       maintainer scripts.

       Please refer to the Debian TeX policy for details about fonts configuration for TeX by Debian packages.
