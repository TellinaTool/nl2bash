ZEITGEIST-DAEMON(1)                            General Commands Manual                           ZEITGEIST-DAEMON(1)



NAME
       zeitgeist-daemon - D-Bus interface providing a log of activities


SYNOPSIS
       zeitgeist-daemon [OPTION]


DESCRIPTION
       zeitgeist-daemon  is  daemon providing an activity log. That is, it consists of a central database for events
       such as file usage, browser history, calendar entries, etc.

       All this information is made available to external applications which communicate with zeitgeist-daemon  over
       D-Bus. Interested applications can request information, insert new events or delete existing events.

       Zeitgeist is also capable of establishing relationships between activities. Its purpose is enabling an activ‐
       ity-aware desktop with adaptive user interfaces.

       By default, zeitgeist-daemon will also start the bundled logging application zeitgeist-datahub.


OPTIONS
       The program follows the usual GNU command line syntax, with options starting with two dashes (`--').  A  sum‐
       mary of options is included below.

       --no-datahub
              Do not start zeitgeist-datahub together with this daemon.

       -r, --replace
              Replace  any  existing  Zeitgeist instance if there is one already running. If this option isn't used,
              zeitgeist-daemon will refuse to start if another running instance is found.

       --log-level=LOG_LEVEL
              Specifies how much information should be printed to the standard output.  Possible values are:  DEBUG,
              INFO, WARNING, ERROR, CRITICAL.

       --log-file=LOG_FILE
              Specifies a file to which log output will be appended.

       -q, --quit
              Stop  a currently running Zeitgeist instance and exit. This lets Zeitgeist finish any operation it may
              currently be doing.

       -v, --version
              Shows which version of Zeitgeist is being executed.

       -h, --help
              Shows a short help message listing all supported options.


ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES
       ZEITGEIST_DATA_PATH
              Overrides the directory where user data files are placed. The default value is that of XDG's data  dir
              (usually ~/.local/share/zeitgeist).

       ZEITGEIST_DATABASE_PATH
              This variable lets you specify an override for the filename of the main database. The default value is
              $ZEITGEIST_DATA_PATH/activity.sqlite.

       ZEITGEIST_DATABASE_BACKUP_PATH
              This variable lets you specify an override for the filename of a possible database backup. The default
              value is $ZEITGEIST_DATA_PATH/activity.sqlite.bck.

       ZEITGEIST_DISABLED_EXTENSIONS
              This  variable lets you specify comma separated list of extension names which shouldn't be loaded. The
              names are extracted from type names of the extensions, so to disable extension with  type  name  Zeit‐
              geistDataSourceRegistry, value of the variable should be DataSourceRegistry.


SIGNALS
       SIGHUP: zeitgeist-daemon will shut itself down in a clean way.
              It  is recommended that system updates of Zeitgeist send this signal to all running instances of zeit‐
              geist-daemon. DBus activation will make sure the updated  software  is  automatically  restarted  when
              needed.


EXIT CODES
       0      Zeitgeist terminated normally.

       1      An unspecified error occurred.

       10     There is already a running Zeitgeist instance.

       21     Could not access the database file.

       22     The database file is locked.
