DESCRIPTION
       apgbfm  is used to manage Bloom filter that is used to restrict password generation in APG pasword generation
       software. Usage of the Bloom filter allows to speed up password check for large  dictionaries  and  has  some
       other benefits.

       The idea to use Bloom filter for that purpose is came from the description of the OPUS project OPUS: Prevent‐
       ing Weak Password Choices Purdue Technical Report CSD-TR 92-028 writen by Eugene H. Spafford.

       You can obtain this article from:
       http://www.cerias.purdue.edu/homes/spaf/tech-reps/9128.ps
       It has very nice description of Bloom filter and it's advantages for password checking systems.

       In simple words, apgbfm generates n hash values for every word and sets corresponding bits in filter file  to
       1.  To  check the word apgbfm generates the same hash functions for that word and if all n corresponding bits
       in filter file are set to 1 then it suppose that word exists in dicionary.  apgbfm uses SHA-1 as a hash func‐
       tion.

       apgbfm can be used as standalone utility, not only with apg, or apgd.

       WARNING !!!
              Filter  file  format  can be changed in the future. I'll try to make file formats compatible but i can
              not guaranty this.

       WARNING !!!
              apgbfm may slow down your computer during filter creation.

OPTIONS
       -f filter
              use filter as the name for Bloom filter filename.

       -i filter
              print information about filter.

       -n numofwords
              create new empty filter for numofwords number of words. Useful when you want to  fill  filter  dynami‐
              caly.

       -d dictfile
              create  new  filter from dictfile. It may take a lot of time to generate filter from a big dictionary.
              In that dictionary you may place words (one per line) that should not appear as  generated  passwords.
              For  example:  user  names  common words, etc. You even can use one of the dictionaries that come with
              dictionary password crackers.  This check is case sensitive. For example, if you want to  reject  word
              'root',  you  should insert in dictfile words: root, Root, RoOt, ... , ROOT.  To indicate that program
              is working apgbfm prints dot for every 100 words added in dictionary.

       -a word
              add word to the filter.

       -A dictfile
              add all words from dictfile to the filter. To indicate that program is working apgbfm prints  dot  for
              every 100 words added in dictionary.

       -c word
              check word for appearance in the filter.

       -C dictfile
              check every word from dictfile for appearance in the filter.

       -q     quiet mode.

       -s     create new filter in case-insensitive mode.

       -v     print version information.

       -h     print help information.

EXIT CODE
       On successful completion of its task, apgbfm will complete with exit code 0.  An exit code of -1 indicates an
       error occurred.  Textual errors are written to the standard error stream.

FILES
       None.

BUGS
       None.  If you've found one, please send bug description to the author.
