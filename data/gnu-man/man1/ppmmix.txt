NAME
       ppmmix - blend together two portable pixmaps

SYNOPSIS
       ppmmix fadefactor ppmfile1 ppmfile2

DESCRIPTION
       Reads two portable pixmaps as input. Mixes them together using the specified fade factor. The fade factor may
       be in the range from 0.0 (only ppmfile1's image data) to 1.0  (only  ppmfile2's  image  data).   Anything  in
       between gains a smooth blend between the two images.

       The two pixmaps must have the same size.

       pnmcomp  is  a  more general alternative.  It allows you to mix images of different size and to have the fade
       factor vary throughout the image (through the use of an alpha mask).
