NAME
       git-prune-packed - Remove extra objects that are already in pack files

SYNOPSIS
       git prune-packed [-n|--dry-run] [-q|--quiet]


DESCRIPTION
       This program searches the $GIT_OBJECT_DIRECTORY for all objects that currently exist in a pack file as well
       as the independent object directories.

       All such extra objects are removed.

       A pack is a collection of objects, individually compressed, with delta compression applied, stored in a
       single file, with an associated index file.

       Packs are used to reduce the load on mirror systems, backup engines, disk storage, etc.

OPTIONS
       -n, --dry-run
           Don’t actually remove any objects, only show those that would have been removed.

       -q, --quiet
           Squelch the progress indicator.
