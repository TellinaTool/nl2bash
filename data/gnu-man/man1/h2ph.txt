H2PH(1)                                   Perl Programmers Reference Guide                                   H2PH(1)



NAME
       h2ph - convert .h C header files to .ph Perl header files

SYNOPSIS
       h2ph [-d destination directory] [-r | -a] [-l] [headerfiles]

DESCRIPTION
       h2ph converts any C header files specified to the corresponding Perl header file format.  It is most easily
       run while in /usr/include:

               cd /usr/include; h2ph * sys/*

       or

               cd /usr/include; h2ph * sys/* arpa/* netinet/*

       or

               cd /usr/include; h2ph -r -l .

       The output files are placed in the hierarchy rooted at Perl's architecture dependent library directory.  You
       can specify a different hierarchy with a -d switch.

       If run with no arguments, filters standard input to standard output.

OPTIONS
       -d destination_dir
           Put the resulting .ph files beneath destination_dir, instead of beneath the default Perl library location
           ($Config{'installsitearch'}).

       -r  Run recursively; if any of headerfiles are directories, then run h2ph on all files in those directories
           (and their subdirectories, etc.).  -r and -a are mutually exclusive.

       -a  Run automagically; convert headerfiles, as well as any .h files which they include.  This option will
           search for .h files in all directories which your C compiler ordinarily uses.  -a and -r are mutually
           exclusive.

       -l  Symbolic links will be replicated in the destination directory.  If -l is not specified, then links are
           skipped over.

       -h  Put 'hints' in the .ph files which will help in locating problems with h2ph.  In those cases when you
           require a .ph file containing syntax errors, instead of the cryptic

                   [ some error condition ] at (eval mmm) line nnn

           you will see the slightly more helpful

                   [ some error condition ] at filename.ph line nnn

           However, the .ph files almost double in size when built using -h.

       -D  Include the code from the .h file as a comment in the .ph file.  This is primarily used for debugging
           h2ph.

       -Q  'Quiet' mode; don't print out the names of the files being converted.

ENVIRONMENT
       No environment variables are used.

FILES
        /usr/include/*.h
        /usr/include/sys/*.h

       etc.

DIAGNOSTICS
       The usual warnings if it can't read or write the files involved.

BUGS
       Doesn't construct the %sizeof array for you.

       It doesn't handle all C constructs, but it does attempt to isolate definitions inside evals so that you can
       get at the definitions that it can translate.

       It's only intended as a rough tool.  You may need to dicker with the files produced.

       You have to run this program by hand; it's not run as part of the Perl installation.

       Doesn't handle complicated expressions built piecemeal, a la:

           enum {
               FIRST_VALUE,
               SECOND_VALUE,
           #ifdef ABC
               THIRD_VALUE
           #endif
           };

       Doesn't necessarily locate all of your C compiler's internally-defined symbols.
