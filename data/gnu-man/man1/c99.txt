NAME
       c99 - ANSI (1999) C compiler

SYNOPSIS
       c99 [-pedantic] [-pedantic-errors] [-D_ANSI_SOURCE] options ...

DESCRIPTION
       Calls  the C compiler (cc) with the given options , using a C language environment compatible with the -ansiC
       specification.

       This includes proper handling of trigraphs, disabling non-ANSI compiler features (such as asm , typeof ,  and
       the $ character in identifiers), and definition of the preprocessor symbol __STRICT_ANSI__ .

       The status of C99 features implemented in GCC is described at http://gcc.gnu.org/gcc-4.8/c99status.html

SEE ALSO
       cc(1) for a description of all options.

HISTORY
       Appeared in NetBSD 1.4 .

BUGS
       Since c99 is a shell wrapper script to cc , compile errors are prefixed by "cc:".
