NAME
       shred - overwrite a file to hide its contents, and optionally delete it

SYNOPSIS
       shred [OPTION]... FILE...

DESCRIPTION
       Overwrite the specified FILE(s) repeatedly, in order to make it harder for even very expensive hardware prob‐
       ing to recover the data.

       Mandatory arguments to long options are mandatory for short options too.

       -f, --force
              change permissions to allow writing if necessary

       -n, --iterations=N
              overwrite N times instead of the default (3)

       --random-source=FILE
              get random bytes from FILE

       -s, --size=N
              shred this many bytes (suffixes like K, M, G accepted)

       -u, --remove
              truncate and remove file after overwriting

       -v, --verbose
              show progress

       -x, --exact
              do not round file sizes up to the next full block;

              this is the default for non-regular files

       -z, --zero
              add a final overwrite with zeros to hide shredding

       --help display this help and exit

       --version
              output version information and exit

       If FILE is -, shred standard output.

       Delete FILE(s) if --remove (-u) is specified.  The default is not to remove the files because it is common to
       operate on device files like /dev/hda, and those files usually should not be removed.  When operating on reg‐
       ular files, most people use the --remove option.

       CAUTION: Note that shred relies on a very important assumption: that  the  file  system  overwrites  data  in
       place.   This  is  the  traditional way to do things, but many modern file system designs do not satisfy this
       assumption.  The following are examples of file systems on which shred is not effective, or is not guaranteed
       to be effective in all file system modes:

       *  log-structured  or journaled file systems, such as those supplied with AIX and Solaris (and JFS, ReiserFS,
       XFS, Ext3, etc.)

       * file systems that write redundant data and carry on even if some writes fail, such as RAID-based file  sys‐
       tems

       * file systems that make snapshots, such as Network Appliance's NFS server

       * file systems that cache in temporary locations, such as NFS version 3 clients

       * compressed file systems

       In  the  case of ext3 file systems, the above disclaimer applies (and shred is thus of limited effectiveness)
       only in data=journal mode, which journals file data in addition to just metadata.  In both  the  data=ordered
       (default) and data=writeback modes, shred works as usual.  Ext3 journaling modes can be changed by adding the
       data=something option to the mount options for a particular file system in the /etc/fstab file, as documented
       in the mount man page (man mount).

       In  addition,  file  system backups and remote mirrors may contain copies of the file that cannot be removed,
       and that will allow a shredded file to be recovered later.
