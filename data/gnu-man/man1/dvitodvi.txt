NAME
       dvitodvi - rearrange pages in a DVI file

SYNOPSIS
       dvitodvi [ -q ] [ -i infile ] [ -o outfile ] [ -wwidth ] [ -hheight ] pagespecs [ infile [ outfile ] ]

DESCRIPTION
       Dvitodvi  rearranges pages from a DVI file, creating a new DVI file.  Dvitodvi can be used to perform a large
       number of arbitrary re-arrangements of Documents, including arranging  for  printing  2-up,  4-up,  booklets,
       reversing, selecting front or back sides of documents, scaling, etc.

       pagespecs follow the syntax:

              pagespecs   = [modulo:][mag@]specs

              specs       = spec[+specs][,specs]

              spec        = [-]pageno[(xoff,yoff)]

       modulo  is the number of pages in each block. The value of modulo should be greater than 0; the default value
       is 1.  The optional mag parameter adjusts the file's magnification by the magnification specified. The magni‐
       fication  and modulo can be specified in reverse order if desired.  specs are the page specifications for the
       pages in each block. The value of the pageno in each spec should be between 0 (for  the  first  page  in  the
       block) and modulo-1 (for the last page in each block) inclusive.  The optional dimensions xoff and yoff shift
       the page by the specified (positive) amount.  xoff and yoff are in PostScript's points, but may  be  followed
       by the units cm or in to convert to centimetres or inches, or the flag w or h to specify as a multiple of the
       width or height.  If the optional minus sign is specified, the page is relative to the end of  the  document,
       instead of the start.

       If page specs are separated by + the pages will be merged into one page; if they are separated by , they will
       be on separate pages.  If there is only one page specification, with pageno zero, the pageno may be omitted.

       The -w option gives the width which is used by the w dimension specifier, and the -h option gives the  height
       which  is  used by the h dimension specifier. These dimensions are also used (after scaling) to set the clip‐
       ping path for each page.

       Dvitodvi normally prints the page numbers of the pages re-arranged; the -q option suppresses this.

EXAMPLES
       This section contains some sample re-arrangements. To put two pages on one sheet (of  landscaped  A3  paper),
       the pagespec to use is:

                                                       2:0+1(21cm,0)

       To reduce an A3 page to A4 size, the pagespec to use is:

                                                     700@(-.3in,-.3in)

       To select all of the odd pages in reverse order, use:

                                                           2:-0

BUGS
       Dvitodvi  does  not adjust some of the parameters in the postamble. This may be a problem if these values are
       used to size certain structures in the output conversion programs.
