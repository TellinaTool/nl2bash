PRECONV(1)                                     General Commands Manual                                    PRECONV(1)



NAME
       preconv - convert encoding of input files to something GNU troff understands

SYNOPSIS
       preconv [-dr] [-e encoding] [files ...]
       preconv -h | --help
       preconv -v | --version

       It is possible to have whitespace between the -e command line option and its parameter.

DESCRIPTION
       preconv  reads  files  and  converts  its encoding(s) to a form GNU troff(1) can process, sending the data to
       standard output.  Currently, this means ASCII characters and `\[uXXXX]' entities, where `XXXX' is a hexadeci‐
       mal  number  with four to six digits, representing a Unicode input code.  Normally, preconv should be invoked
       with the -k and -K options of groff.

OPTIONS
       -d     Emit debugging messages to standard error (mainly the used encoding).

       -Dencoding
              Specify default encoding if everything fails (see below).

       -eencoding
              Specify input encoding explicitly, overriding all other methods.  This corresponds to groff's -Kencod‐
              ing  option.   Without  this  switch,  preconv  uses the algorithm described below to select the input
              encoding.

       --help
       -h     Print help message.

       -r     Do not add .lf requests.

       --version
       -v     Print version number.

USAGE
       preconv tries to find the input encoding with the following algorithm.

       1.     If the input encoding has been explicitly specified with option -e, use it.

       2.     Otherwise, check whether the input starts with a Byte Order Mark (BOM, see below).  If found, use it.

       3.     Finally, check whether there is a known coding tag (see below) in either the  first  or  second  input
              line.  If found, use it.

       4.     If  everything  fails,  use  a  default  encoding  as  given with option -D, by the current locale, or
              `latin1' if the locale is set to `C', `POSIX', or empty (in that order).

       Note that the groff program supports a GROFF_ENCODING environment variable which is  eventually  expanded  to
       option -k.

   Byte Order Mark
       The  Unicode Standard defines character U+FEFF as the Byte Order Mark (BOM).  On the other hand, value U+FFFE
       is guaranteed not be a Unicode character at all.  This allows to detect the byte order within the data stream
       (either  big-endian  or  lower-endian),  and  the  MIME encodings `UTF-16' and `UTF-32' mandate that the data
       stream starts with U+FEFF.  Similarly, the data stream encoded as `UTF-8' might start with a BOM (to ease the
       conversion  from  and  to  UTF-16 and UTF-32).  In all cases, the byte order mark is not part of the data but
       part of the encoding protocol; in other words, preconv's output doesn't contain it.

       Note that U+FEFF not at the start of the input data actually is emitted; it has then the meaning of  a  `zero
       width no-break space' character – something not needed normally in groff.

   Coding Tags
       Editors  which  support  more  than  a single character encoding need tags within the input files to mark the
       file's encoding.  While it is possible to guess the right input encoding with the  help  of  heuristic  algo‐
       rithms for data which represents a greater amount of a natural language, it is still just a guess.  Addition‐
       ally, all algorithms fail easily for input which is either too short or doesn't represent a natural language.

       For these reasons, preconv supports the coding tag convention (with some restrictions) as used by  GNU  Emacs
       and XEmacs (and probably other programs too).

       Coding tags in GNU Emacs and XEmacs are stored in so-called File Variables.  preconv recognizes the following
       syntax form which must be put into a troff comment in the first or second line.

              -*- tag1: value1; tag2: value2; ... -*-

       The only relevant tag for preconv is `coding' which can take the values listed below.  Here an  example  line
       which tells Emacs to edit a file in troff mode, and to use latin2 as its encoding.

              .\" -*- mode: troff; coding: latin-2 -*-

       The following list gives all MIME coding tags (either lowercase or uppercase) supported by preconv; this list
       is hard-coded in the source.

              big5, cp1047, euc-jp, euc-kr, gb2312, iso-8859-1, iso-8859-2, iso-8859-5, iso-8859-7, iso-8859-9,
              iso-8859-13, iso-8859-15, koi8-r, us-ascii, utf-8, utf-16, utf-16be, utf-16le

       In  addition,  the  following hard-coded list of other tags is recognized which eventually map to values from
       the list above.

              ascii, chinese-big5, chinese-euc, chinese-iso-8bit, cn-big5, cn-gb, cn-gb-2312, cp878, csascii,
              csisolatin1, cyrillic-iso-8bit, cyrillic-koi8, euc-china, euc-cn, euc-japan, euc-japan-1990,
              euc-korea, greek-iso-8bit, iso-10646/utf8, iso-10646/utf-8, iso-latin-1, iso-latin-2, iso-latin-5,
              iso-latin-7, iso-latin-9, japanese-euc, japanese-iso-8bit, jis8, koi8, korean-euc, korean-iso-8bit,
              latin-0, latin1, latin-1, latin-2, latin-5, latin-7, latin-9, mule-utf-8, mule-utf-16, mule-utf-16be,
              mule-utf-16-be, mule-utf-16be-with-signature, mule-utf-16le, mule-utf-16-le,
              mule-utf-16le-with-signature, utf8, utf-16-be, utf-16-be-with-signature, utf-16be-with-signature,
              utf-16-le, utf-16-le-with-signature, utf-16le-with-signature

       Those  tags  are  taken from GNU Emacs and XEmacs, together with some aliases.  Trailing `-dos', `-unix', and
       `-mac' suffixes of coding tags (which give the end-of-line convention used in  the  file)  are  stripped  off
       before the comparison with the above tags happens.

   Iconv Issues
       preconv  by  itself only supports three encodings: latin-1, cp1047, and UTF-8; all other encodings are passed
       to the iconv library functions.  At compile time it is searched and checked for a valid iconv implementation;
       a call to `preconv --version' shows whether iconv is used.

BUGS
       preconv doesn't support local variable lists yet.  This is a different syntax form to specify local variables
       at the end of a file.
