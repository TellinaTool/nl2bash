UCFR(1)                                        Debian GNU/Linux manual                                       UCFR(1)



NAME
       ucfr - Update Configuration File Registry:  associate packages with configuration files

SYNOPSIS
       ucfr [options] <Package> <Path to configuration file>

DESCRIPTION
       Where Package is the package associated with the configuration file (and, in some sense, its owner), and Path
       to configuration file is the full path to the location (usually under  /etc)  where  the  configuration  file
       lives, and is potentially modified by the end user.

       This  script  maintains an association between configuration files and packages, and is meant to help provide
       facilities that dpkg provides conffiles for configuration files and not shipped in a Debian package, but han‐
       dled  by  the  postinst  by  ucf instead. This script is idempotent, associating a package to a file multiple
       times is not an error.  It is normally an error to try to associate a file which is already  associated  with
       another package, but this can be over ridden by using the --force option.

OPTIONS
       -h, --help
              Print a short usage message

       -n, --no-action
              Dry run. Print the actions that would be taken if the script is invoked, but take no action.

       -d [n], --debug [n]
              Set  the  debug  level  to  the  (optional) level n (n defaults to 1). This turns on copious debugging
              information.

       -p, --purge
              Removes all vestiges of the association between the named package and the configuration file from  the
              registry.  The association must already exist; if the configuration file is associated with some other
              package, an error happens, unless the option --force is also given. In that case, the any associations
              for  the  configuration  file  are removed from the registry, whether or not the package name matches.
              This action is idempotent, asking for an association to be purged multiple times does not result in an
              error, since attempting to remove an non-existent association is silently ignored unless the --verbose
              option is used (in which case it just issues a diagnostic).

       -v, --verbose
              Make the script be very verbose about setting internal variables.

       -f, --force
              This option forces operations requested even if the configuration file in consideration  is  owned  by
              another  package.  This  allows  a  package to hijack a configuration file from another package, or to
              purge the association between the file and some other package in the registry.

       --state-dir /path/to/dir
              Set the state directory to /path/to/dir instead of the default /var/lib/ucf.  Used mostly for testing.

USAGE
       The most common case usage is pretty simple: a single line invocation  in  the  postinst  on  configure,  and
       another single line in the postrm to tell ucfr to forget about the association with the configuration file on
       purge (using the  --purge option) is all that is needed (assuming ucfr is still on the system).

FILES
       /var/lib/ucf/registry, and /var/lib/ucf/registry.X, where X is a small integer, where  previous  versions  of
       the registry are stored.

       /etc/ucf.conf

EXAMPLES
       If the package foo wants to use ucfr to associate itself with a configuration file foo.conf, a simple invoca‐
       tion of ucfr in the postinst file is all that is needed:

       ucfr foo /etc/foo.conf

       On purge, one should tell ucf to forget about the file (see detailed examples in /usr/share/doc/examples):

       ucfr --purge foo /etc/foo.conf
