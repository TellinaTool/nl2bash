NAME
       appres - list X application resource database

SYNOPSIS
       appres [class [instance]] [-1] [-V] [toolkitoptions]

DESCRIPTION
       The  appres  program prints the resources seen by an application (or subhierarchy of an application) with the
       specified class and instance names.  It can be used to determine which resources a  particular  program  will
       load.  For example,

            % appres  XTerm

       will  list  the  resources that any xterm program will load.  If no application class is specified, the class
       -AppResTest- is used.

       To match a particular instance name, specify an instance name explicitly after the class  name,  or  use  the
       normal Xt toolkit option.  For example,

            % appres  XTerm  myxterm
       or
            % appres  XTerm  -name  myxterm

       To list resources that match a subhierarchy of an application, specify hierarchical class and instance names.
       The number of class and instance components must be equal, and the instance name should not be specified with
       a toolkit option.  For example,

            % appres  Xman.TopLevelShell.Form  xman.topBox.form

       will  list the resources of widgets of xman topBox hierarchy.  To list just the resources matching a specific
       level in the hierarchy, use the -1 option.  For example,

            % appres  XTerm.VT100  xterm.vt100  -1

       will list the resources matching the xterm vt100 widget.

       The -V option prints the appres command version and exits.
