NAME
       allneeded - force the calculation of all fonts now needed

SYNOPSIS
       allneeded [-r] files ...

DESCRIPTION
       allneeded  forces  the  calculation  of all fonts that are needed to preview a set of dvi files. Just specify
       where the program should search for files on the commandline.  The fonts generation is triggered  by  running
       dvips(1) over all accessible dvi-files. Therefore, the fonts are created in the resolution needed by dvips.

       If the -r flag is specified, the command dvired(1) will be used instead of dvips.

       allneeded does not recalculate existing fonts (as long as the Metafont mode does not change).


SEE ALSO
       allec(1), allcm(1), dvips(1), dvired(1).
