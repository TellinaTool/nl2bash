SYNOPSIS
       ppmdither [-dim power] [-red shades] [-green shades] [-blue shades] [ppmfile]

DESCRIPTION
       Reads a portable pixmap as input, and applies dithering to it to reduce the number of colors used down to the
       specified number of shades for each primary.  The default number of shades is red=5, green=9, blue=5,  for  a
       total  of  225  colors.   To convert the image to a binary rgb format suitable for color printers, use -red 2
       -green 2 -blue 2.

       -dim power    The size of the dithering matrix.  The dithering matrix is a square whose dimension is a  power
                     of 2.  power is that power of 2.  The default is 4, for a 16 by 16 matrix.
