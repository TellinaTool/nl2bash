DESCRIPTION
       readelf displays information about one or more ELF format object files.  The options control what particular
       information to display.

       elffile... are the object files to be examined.  32-bit and 64-bit ELF files are supported, as are archives
       containing ELF files.

       This program performs a similar function to objdump but it goes into more detail and it exists independently
       of the BFD library, so if there is a bug in BFD then readelf will not be affected.

OPTIONS
       The long and short forms of options, shown here as alternatives, are equivalent.  At least one option besides
       -v or -H must be given.

       -a
       --all
           Equivalent to specifying --file-header, --program-headers, --sections, --symbols, --relocs, --dynamic,
           --notes and --version-info.

       -h
       --file-header
           Displays the information contained in the ELF header at the start of the file.

       -l
       --program-headers
       --segments
           Displays the information contained in the file's segment headers, if it has any.

       -S
       --sections
       --section-headers
           Displays the information contained in the file's section headers, if it has any.

       -g
       --section-groups
           Displays the information contained in the file's section groups, if it has any.

       -t
       --section-details
           Displays the detailed section information. Implies -S.

       -s
       --symbols
       --syms
           Displays the entries in symbol table section of the file, if it has one.

       --dyn-syms
           Displays the entries in dynamic symbol table section of the file, if it has one.

       -e
       --headers
           Display all the headers in the file.  Equivalent to -h -l -S.

       -n
       --notes
           Displays the contents of the NOTE segments and/or sections, if any.

       -r
       --relocs
           Displays the contents of the file's relocation section, if it has one.

       -u
       --unwind
           Displays the contents of the file's unwind section, if it has one.  Only the unwind sections for IA64 ELF
           files, as well as ARM unwind tables (".ARM.exidx" / ".ARM.extab") are currently supported.

       -d
       --dynamic
           Displays the contents of the file's dynamic section, if it has one.

       -V
       --version-info
           Displays the contents of the version sections in the file, it they exist.

       -A
       --arch-specific
           Displays architecture-specific information in the file, if there is any.

       -D
       --use-dynamic
           When displaying symbols, this option makes readelf use the symbol hash tables in the file's dynamic
           section, rather than the symbol table sections.

       -x <number or name>
       --hex-dump=<number or name>
           Displays the contents of the indicated section as a hexadecimal bytes.  A number identifies a particular
           section by index in the section table; any other string identifies all sections with that name in the
           object file.

       -R <number or name>
       --relocated-dump=<number or name>
           Displays the contents of the indicated section as a hexadecimal bytes.  A number identifies a particular
           section by index in the section table; any other string identifies all sections with that name in the
           object file.  The contents of the section will be relocated before they are displayed.

       -p <number or name>
       --string-dump=<number or name>
           Displays the contents of the indicated section as printable strings.  A number identifies a particular
           section by index in the section table; any other string identifies all sections with that name in the
           object file.

       -c
       --archive-index
           Displays the file symbol index information contained in the header part of binary archives.  Performs the
           same function as the t command to ar, but without using the BFD library.

       -w[lLiaprmfFsoRt]
       --debug-dump[=rawline,=decodedline,=info,=abbrev,=pubnames,=aranges,=macro,=frames,=frames-interp,=str,=loc,=Ranges,=pubtypes,=trace_info,=trace_abbrev,=trace_aranges,=gdb_index]
           Displays the contents of the debug sections in the file, if any are present.  If one of the optional
           letters or words follows the switch then only data found in those specific sections will be dumped.

           Note that there is no single letter option to display the content of trace sections or .gdb_index.

           Note: the =decodedline option will display the interpreted contents of a .debug_line section whereas the
           =rawline option dumps the contents in a raw format.

           Note: the =frames-interp option will display the interpreted contents of a .debug_frame section whereas
           the =frames option dumps the contents in a raw format.

           Note: the output from the =info option can also be affected by the options --dwarf-depth and
           --dwarf-start.

       --dwarf-depth=n
           Limit the dump of the ".debug_info" section to n children.  This is only useful with --debug-dump=info.
           The default is to print all DIEs; the special value 0 for n will also have this effect.

           With a non-zero value for n, DIEs at or deeper than n levels will not be printed.  The range for n is
           zero-based.

       --dwarf-start=n
           Print only DIEs beginning with the DIE numbered n.  This is only useful with --debug-dump=info.

           If specified, this option will suppress printing of any header information and all DIEs before the DIE
           numbered n.  Only siblings and children of the specified DIE will be printed.

           This can be used in conjunction with --dwarf-depth.

       -I
       --histogram
           Display a histogram of bucket list lengths when displaying the contents of the symbol tables.

       -v
       --version
           Display the version number of readelf.

       -W
       --wide
           Don't break output lines to fit into 80 columns. By default readelf breaks section header and segment
           listing lines for 64-bit ELF files, so that they fit into 80 columns. This option causes readelf to print
           each section header resp. each segment one a single line, which is far more readable on terminals wider
           than 80 columns.

       -H
       --help
           Display the command line options understood by readelf.

       @file
           Read command-line options from file.  The options read are inserted in place of the original @file
           option.  If file does not exist, or cannot be read, then the option will be treated literally, and not
           removed.

           Options in file are separated by whitespace.  A whitespace character may be included in an option by
           surrounding the entire option in either single or double quotes.  Any character (including a backslash)
           may be included by prefixing the character to be included with a backslash.  The file may itself contain
           additional @file options; any such options will be processed recursively.
