NAME
       mxtar - Wrapper for using GNU tar directly from a floppy disk

SYNOPSIS
       mxtar [ - ] [ tar-options ] file

DESCRIPTION
       mxtar let you use GNU tar(1) on a floppy disk without mounting it using mtools(1).  It is not strictly neces‐
       sary on Debian GNU/Linux, because the GNU tar(1) program provides the same capability after copying the  file
       locally with

       mcopy file destination

       but this utility is provided in the mtools package for other platforms and is retained here for completeness.
