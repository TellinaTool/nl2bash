DESCRIPTION
       This program extracts the metric and kerning information of a TrueType font and converts it into metric files
       usable by TeX (quite similar to afm2tfm which is part of the dvips package; please consult its info files for
       more details on the various parameters (especially encoding files).

       Since  a  TrueType  font often contains more than 256 glyphs, some means are necessary to map a subset of the
       TrueType glyphs onto a TeX font.  To do this, two mapping tables are needed: the  first  (called  `input'  or
       `raw'  encoding)  maps  the  TrueType  font to a raw TeX font (this mapping table is used by both ttf2tfm and
       ttf2pk), and the second (called `output' or `virtual' encoding) maps the raw TeX font  to  another  (virtual)
       TeX font, providing all kerning and ligature information needed by TeX.

       This  two  stage  mapping  has  the  advantage that one raw font can be accessed with various LaTeX encodings
       (e.g. T1 and OT1) via the virtual font mechanism, and just one PK file is necessary.

       For CJKV (Chinese/Japanese/Korean/old Vietnamese) fonts, a different mechanism is provided (see SUBFONT DEFI‐
       NITION FILES below).

PARAMETERS
       Most  of the command line switch names are the same as in afm2tfm for convenience.  One or more space charac‐
       ters between an option and its value is mandatory; options can't be concatenated.   For  historical  reasons,
       the first parameter can not be a switch but must be the font name.

       -c caps-height-factor
              The  height of small caps made with the -V switch.  Default value of this real number is 0.8 times the
              height of uppercase glyphs.

              Will be ignored in subfont mode.

       -e extension-factor
              The extension factor to stretch the characters  horizontally.   Default  value  of  this  real  number
              is 1.0; if less than 1.0, you get a condensed font.

       -E encoding-id
              The TrueType encoding ID.  Default value of this non-negative integer is 1.

              Will be ignored if -N is used.

       -f font-index
              The  font index in a TrueType Collection.  Default is the first font (index 0).  [TrueType collections
              are usually found in some CJK fonts; e.g. the first font index specifies glyphs and metrics for  hori‐
              zontal  writing,  and  the second font index does the same for vertical writing.  TrueType collections
              usually have the extension `.ttc'.]

              Will be ignored for ordinary TrueType fonts.

       -l     Create ligatures in subfonts between first and second bytes of all the original character codes.   Ex‐
              ample:   Character  code 0xABCD maps to character position 123 in subfont 45.  Then a ligature in sub‐
              font 45 between position 0xAB and 0xCD pointing to character 123 will be produced.  The fonts  of  the
              Korean  HLaTeX  package  use this feature.  Note that this option generates correct ligatures only for
              TrueType fonts where the input cmap is identical to the output encoding.  In case of HLaTeX, TTFs must
              have platform ID 3 and encoding ID 5.

              Will be ignored if not in subfont mode.

       -L ligature-file
              Same  as  -l,  but  character  codes  for  ligatures  are  specified  in  ligature-file.  For example,
              `-L KS-HLaTeX' generates correct ligatures for the Korean HLaTeX package regardless  of  the  platform
              and encoding ID of the used TrueType font (the file KS-HLaTeX.sfd is part of the ttf2pk package).

              Ligature files have the same format and extension as SFD files.  This option will be ignored if not in
              subfont mode.

       -n     Use PS names (of glyphs) of the TrueType font.  Only glyphs with a valid entry in  the  selected  cmap
              are used.

              Will be ignored in subfont mode.

       -N     Use  only PS names of the TrueType font.  No cmap is used, thus the switches -E and -P have no effect,
              causing a warning message.

              Will be ignored in subfont mode.

       -O     Use octal values for all character codes in the VPL file rather than names; this is useful for  symbol
              or CJK fonts where character names such as `A' are meaningless.

       -p inencfile
              The input encoding file name for the TTF→raw TeX mapping.  This parameter has to be specified in a map
              file (default: ttfonts.map) recorded in ttf2pk.cfg for successive ttf2pk calls.

              Will be ignored in subfont mode.

       -P platform-id
              The TrueType platform ID.  Default value of this non-negative integer is 3.

              Will be ignored if -N is used.

       -q     Make ttf2tfm quiet.  It suppresses any informational output except warning and  error  messages.   For
              CJK fonts, the output can get quite large if you don't specify this switch.

       -r old-glyphname new-glyphname
              Replaces old-glyphname with new-glyphname.  This switch is useful if you want to give an unnamed glyph
              (i.e., a glyph which can be represented with `.gXXX' or `.cXXX' only) a name or if you want to  rename
              an  already  existing  glyph  name.   You  can't  use the `.gXXX' or `.cXXX' glyph name constructs for
              new-glyphname; multiple occurrences of -r are possible.

              If in subfont mode or if no encoding file is specified, this switch is ignored.

       -R replacement-file
              Use this switch if you have many replacement pairs; they can be  collected in a file which should have
              `.rpl'  as  extension.   The syntax used in such replacement files is simple: Each non-empty line must
              contain a pair `old-glyphname new-glyphname' separated by whitespace (without the quotation marks).  A
              percent  sign  starts a line comment; you can continue a line on the next line with a backslash as the
              last character.

              If in subfont mode or if no encoding file is specified, this switch is ignored.

       -s slant-factor
              The obliqueness factor to slant the font, usually much smaller than 1.  Default of  this  real  number
              is 0.0; if the value is larger than zero, the characters slope to the right, otherwise to the left.

       -t outencfile
              The output encoding file name for the virtual font(s).  Only characters in the raw TeX font are used.

              Will be ignored in subfont mode.

       -T inoutencfile
              This is equivalent to `-p inoutencfile -t inoutencfile'.

              Will be ignored in subfont mode.

       -u     Use  only those characters specified in the output encoding, and no others.  By default, ttf2tfm tries
              to include all characters in the virtual font, even those not present in the encoding for the  virtual
              font (it puts them into otherwise-unused positions, rather arbitrarily).

              Will be ignored in subfont mode.

       -v vplfile
              Output  a VPL file in addition to the TFM file.  If no output encoding file is specified, ttf2tfm uses
              a default font encoding (cmtt10).  Note: Be careful to use different names for the  virtual  font  and
              the raw font!

              Will be ignored in subfont mode.

       -V scvplfile
              Same  as  -v, but the virtual font generated is a pseudo small caps font obtained by scaling uppercase
              letters by 0.8 (resp. the value specified with -c) to typeset lowercase.  This font  handles  accented
              letters and retains proper kerning.

              Will be ignored in subfont mode.

       -w     Generate  PostScript encoding vectors containing glyph indices, primarily used to embed TrueType fonts
              in pdfTeX.  ttf2tfm takes the TFM names and  replaces  the  suffix  with  .enc;  that  is,  for  files
              foo01.tfm, foo02.tfm, ... it creates foo01.enc, foo02.enc, ... at the same place.

              Will be ignored if not in subfont mode.

       -x     Rotate  all  glyphs  by 90 degrees counter-clockwise.  If no -y parameter is given, the rotated glyphs
              are shifted down vertically by 0.25em.

              Will be ignored if not in subfont mode.

       -y vertical-shift-factor
              Shift down rotated glyphs by the given amount (the unit is em).

              Ignored if not in subfont mode or glyphs are not rotated.

       --version
              Shows the current version of ttf2tfm and the used file search library (e.g.  kpathsea).

       --help Shows usage information.

       If no TFM file name is given, the name of the TTF file is used, including the full path and replacing the ex‐
       tension with `.tfm'.

CMAPS
       Contrary  to Type 1 PostScript fonts (but similar to the new CID PostScript font format), most TrueType fonts
       have more than one native mapping table, also called `cmap', which maps the (internal) TTF glyph  indices  to
       the  (external)  TTF character codes.  Common examples are a mapping table to Unicode encoded character posi‐
       tions, and the standard Macintosh mapping.

       To specify a TrueType mapping table, use the options -P and -E.  With -P you specify the platform ID; defined
       values are:

           platform              platform ID (pid)

           Apple Unicode                0
           Macintosh                    1
           ISO                          2
           Microsoft                    3

       The  encoding  ID  depends on the platform.  For pid=0, we ignore the -E parameter (setting it to zero) since
       the mapping table is always Unicode version 2.0.  For pid=1, the following table lists the defined values:

         platform ID = 1

           encoding              encoding ID (eid)

       The program will abort if you specify an invalid platform/encoding ID pair.  It will then show  the  possible
       pid/eid  pairs.   Please  note  that most fonts have at most two or three cmaps, usually corresponding to the
       pid/eid pairs (1,0), (3,0), or (3,1) in case of Latin based fonts.  Valid Microsoft fonts should have a (3,1)
       mapping table, but some fonts exist (mostly Asian fonts) which have a (3,1) cmap not encoded in Unicode.  The
       reason for this strange behavior is the fact that some old MS Windows versions will  reject  fonts  having  a
       non-(3,1) cmap (since all non-Unicode Microsoft encoding IDs are for Asian MS Windows versions).

       The  -P and -E options of ttf2tfm must be equally specified for ttf2pk; the corresponding parameters in a map
       file are `Pid' and `Eid', respectively.

       The default pid/eid pair is (3,1).

       Similarly, an -f option must be specified as `Fontindex' parameter in a map file.

       If you use the -N switch, all cmaps are ignored, using only the PostScript names in the TrueType  font.   The
       corresponding option in a map file is `PS=Only'.  If you use the -n switch, the default glyph names built in‐
       to ttf2tfm are replaced with the PS glyph names found in the font.  In many cases this is not what  you  want
       because  the  glyph names in the font are often incorrect or non-standard.  The corresponding option in a map
       file is `PS=Yes'.

       Single replacement glyph names specified with -r must be given directly as `old-glyphname new-glyphname' in a
       map file; -R is equivalent to the `Replacement' option.

INPUT AND OUTPUT ENCODINGS
       You must specify the encoding vectors from the TrueType font to the raw TeX font and from the raw TeX font to
       the virtual TeX font exactly as with afm2tfm, but you have more possibilities to address the character codes.
       [With  `encoding  vector'  a  mapping table with 256 entries in form of a PostScript vector is meant; see the
       file T1-WGL4.enc of this package for an example.]  With afm2tfm, you must access each glyph  with  its  Adobe
       glyph  name,  e.g. `/quotedsingle'  or `/Acircumflex'.  This has been extended with ttf2tfm; now you can (and
       sometimes must) access the code points and/or glyphs directly, using the following syntax for specifying  the
       character  position  in decimal, octal, or hexadecimal notation: `/.c<decimal-number>', `/.c0<octal-number>',
       or `/.c0x<hexadecimal-number>'.  Examples: `/.c72', `/.c0646', `/.c0x48'.  To access a glyph index  directly,
       use  the  character  `g'  instead  of  `c'  in the just introduced notation.  Example: `/.g0x32'.  [Note: The
       `.cXXX' notation makes no sense if -N is used.]

       For pid/eid pairs (1,0) and (3,1), both ttf2tfm and ttf2pk recognize built-in default Adobe glyph names;  the
       former  follows  the  names given in Appendix E of the book `Inside Macintosh', volume 6, the latter uses the
       names given in the TrueType Specification (WGL4, a Unicode subset).  Note that Adobe names for a given  glyph
       are  often not unique and do sometimes differ, e.g., many PS fonts have the glyph `mu', whereas this glyph is
       called `mu1' in the WGL4 character set to distinguish it from the real Greek letter mu.  Be also  aware  that
       OpenType (i.e. TrueType 2.0) fonts use an updated WGL4 table; we use the data from the latest published True‐
       Type specification (1.66).  You can find those mapping tables in the source code file ttfenc.c.

       On the other hand, the switches -n and -N makes ttf2tfm read in and use the PostScript names in the  TrueType
       font itself (stored in the `post' table) instead of the default Adobe glyph names.

       Use  the  -r  switch  to  remap single glyph names and -R to specify a file containing replacement glyph name
       pairs.

       If you don't select an input encoding, the first 256 glyphs of the TrueType font with a valid  entry  in  the
       selected cmap will be mapped to the TeX raw font (without the -q option, ttf2tfm prints this mapping table to
       standard output), followed by all glyphs not yet addressed in the selected cmap.  However, some  code  points
       for  the  (1,0) pid/eid pair are omitted since they do not represent glyphs useful for TeX: 0x00 (null), 0x08
       (backspace), 0x09 (horizontal tabulation), 0x0d (carriage return), and 0x1d (group separator).  The  `invalid
       character' with glyph index 0 will be omitted too.

       If  you  select the -N switch, the first 256 glyphs of the TrueType font with a valid PostScript name will be
       used in case no input encoding is specified.  Again, some glyphs are omitted:  `.notdef', `.null', and  `non‐
       markingreturn'.

       If  you  don't  select an  output encoding, ttf2tfm uses the same mapping table as afm2tfm would use (you can
       find it in the source code file texenc.c); it corresponds to TeX typewriter text.  Unused  positions  (either
       caused  by  empty  code  points  in  the mapping table or missing glyphs in the TrueType font) will be filled
       (rather arbitrarily) with characters present in the input encoding but not specified in the  output  encoding
       (without  the  -q  option ttf2tfm prints the final output encoding to standard output).  Use the -u option if
       you want only glyphs in the virtual font which are defined in the output encoding file, and nothing more.

       One feature missing in afm2tfm has been added which is needed by LaTeX's T1 encoding: ttf2tfm will  construct
       the  glyph  `Germandbls'  (by simply concatenating two `S' glyphs) even for normal fonts if possible.  It ap‐
       pears in the glyph list as the last item, marked with an asterisk.  Since this isn't a real glyph it will  be
       available only in the virtual font.

       For both input and output encoding, an empty code position is represented by the glyph name `/.notdef'.

       In  encoding  files, you can use `\' as the final character of a line to indicate that the input is continued
       on the next line.  The backslash and the following newline character will be removed.

SUBFONT DEFINITION FILES
       CJKV (Chinese/Japanese/Korean/old Vietnamese) fonts usually contain several thousand glyphs; to use them with
       TeX  it  is  necessary to split such large fonts into subfonts.  Subfont definition files (usually having the
       extension `.sfd') are a simple means to do this smoothly.

       A subfont file name usually consists of a prefix, a subfont infix, and a postfix (which is empty in most cas‐
       es), e.g.

         ntukai23 → prefix: ntukai, infix: 23, postfix: (empty)

       Here the syntax of a line in an SFD file, describing one subfont:

       <whitespace> <infix> <whitespace> <ranges> <whitespace>


       <infix> :=
              anything except whitespace.  It is best to use only alphanumerical characters.

       <whitespace> :=
              space, formfeed, carriage return, horizontal and vertical tabs -- no newline characters.

       <ranges> :=
              <ranges> <whitespace> <codepoint> |
              <ranges> <whitespace> <range> |
              <ranges> <whitespace> <offset> <whitespace> <range>

       <codepoint> :=
              <number>

       <range> :=
              <number> `_' <number>

       <offset> :=
              <number> `:'

       <number> :=
              hexadecimal (prefix `0x'), decimal, or octal (prefix `0')

       A line can be continued on the next line with a backslash ending the line.  The ranges must not overlap; off‐
       sets have to be in the range 0-255.

       Example:

         The line

           03   10: 0x2349 0x2345_0x2347

         assigns to the code positions 10, 11, 12, and 13 of the subfont having the infix `03' the  character  codes
         0x2349, 0x2345, 0x2346, and 0x2347 respectively.

       The SFD files in the distribution are customized for the CJK package for LaTeX.

       You  have  to  embed the SFD file name into the TFM font name (at the place where the infix will appear) sur‐
       rounded by two `@' signs, on the command line resp. a map file; both ttf2tfm and ttf2pk switch then  to  sub‐
       font mode.

       It  is  possible  to use more than a single SFD file by separating them with commata and no whitespace; for a
       given subfont, the first file is scanned for an entry, then the next file, and so on.  Later entries override
       entries  found  earlier  (possibly only partially).  For example, the first SFD file sets up range 0x10-0xA0,
       and the next one modifies entries 0x12 and 0x25.  As can be easily seen, this algorithm allows for adding and
       replacing, but not for removing entries.

       Subfont  mode  disables  the options -n, -N, -p, -r, -R, -t, -T, -u, -v, -V and -w for ttf2tfm; similarly, no
       `Encoding' or `Replacement' parameter is allowed in a map file.  Single replacement glyph names  are  ignored
       too.

       ttf2tfm  will  create all subfont TFM files specified in the SFD files (provided the subfont contains glyphs)
       in one run.

       Example:

         The call

           ttf2tfm ntukai.ttf ntukai@Big5,Big5-supp@

         will use Big5.sfd and Big5-supp.sfd, producing all subfont files ntukai01.tfm, ntukai02.tfm, etc.

RETURN VALUE
       ttf2tfm returns 0 on success and 1 on error; warning and error messages are written to standard error.

SOME NOTES ON FILE SEARCHING
       Both ttf2pk and ttf2tfm use either the kpathsea, emtexdir, or MiKTeX library for  searching  files  (emtexdir
       will  work  only on operating systems which have an MS-DOSish background, i.e.  MS-DOS, OS/2, Windows; MikTeX
       is specific to MS Windows).

       As a last resort, both programs can be compiled without a search library; the searched files must be then  in
       the current directory or specified with a path.  Default extensions will be appended also (with the exception
       that only `.ttf' is appended and not `.ttc').

   kpathsea
       The actual version of kpathsea is displayed on screen if you call either ttf2pk or ttf2tfm with the --version
       command line switch.

       Here  is  a  table of the file type and the corresponding kpathsea variables.  TTF2PKINPUTS and TTF2TFMINPUTS
       are program specific environment variables introduced in kpathsea version 3.2:

           .ttf and .ttc       TTFONTS
           ttf2pk.cfg          TTF2PKINPUTS
           .map                TTF2PKINPUTS
           .enc                TTF2PKINPUTS, TTF2TFMINPUTS
           .rpl                TTF2PKINPUTS, TTF2TFMINPUTS
           .tfm                TFMFONTS
           .sfd                TTF2PKINPUTS, TTF2TFMINPUTS

       Please consult the info files of kpathsea for details on these variables.

       You should set the TEXMFCNF variable to the directory where your texmf.cnf configuration file resides.

       Here is the proper command to find out to which value a kpathsea variable is set (we use TTFONTS as an  exam‐
       ple).  This is especially useful if a variable isn't set in texmf.cnf or in the environment, thus pointing to
       the default value which is hard-coded into the kpathsea library.

         kpsewhich -progname=ttf2tfm -expand-var='$TTFONTS'

       We select the program name also since it is possible to specify variables which are searched only for a  cer‐
       tain program -- in our example it would be TTFONTS.ttf2tfm.

       A similar but not identical method is to say

         kpsewhich -progname=ttf2tfm -show-path='truetype fonts'

       [A  full list of format types can be obtained by saying `kpsewhich --help' on the command line prompt.]  This
       is exactly how ttf2tfm (and ttf2pk) searches for files; the disadvantage is that all variables  are  expanded
       which can cause very long strings.

   emtexdir
       Here  the  list  of suffixes and their related environment variables to be set in autoexec.bat (resp. in con‐
       fig.sys for OS/2):

           .ttf and .ttc       TTFONTS
           ttf2pk.cfg          TTFCFG
           .map                TTFCFG
           .enc                TTFCFG
           .rpl                TTFCFG
           .tfm                TEXTFM
           .sfd                TTFCFG

       If one of the variables isn't set, a warning message is emitted.   The  current  directory  will  always   be
       searched.   As  usual, one exclamation mark appended to a directory path causes subdirectories one level deep
       to be searched, two exclamation marks cause all subdirectories to be searched.  Example:

         TTFONTS=c:\fonts\truetype!!;d:\myfonts\truetype!

       Constructions like `c:\fonts!!\truetype' aren't possible.

   MiKTeX
       Both ttf2tfm and ttf2pk have been fully integrated into MiKTeX.  Please refer to the documentation of  MiKTeX
       for more details on file searching.

PROBLEMS
       Many vptovf implementations allow only 100 bytes for the TFM header (the limit is 1024 in the TFM file format
       itself): 8 bytes for checksum and design size, 40 bytes for the family name, 20 bytes for the  encoding,  and
       4 bytes for a face byte.  There remain only 28 bytes for some additional information which is used by ttf2tfm
       for an identification string (which is essentially a copy of the command line), and this limit is always  ex‐
       ceeded.

       The  optimal  solution  is  to  increase  the  value of max_header_bytes in the file vptovf.web (and probably
       pltotf.web too) to, say, 400 and recompile vptovf (and pltotf).  Otherwise you'll get some  (harmless)  error
       messages like

         This HEADER index is too big for my present table size

       which can be safely ignored.
