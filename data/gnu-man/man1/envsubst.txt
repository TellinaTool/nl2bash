NAME
       envsubst - substitutes environment variables in shell format strings

SYNOPSIS
       envsubst [OPTION] [SHELL-FORMAT]

DESCRIPTION
       Substitutes the values of environment variables.

   Operation mode:
       -v, --variables
              output the variables occurring in SHELL-FORMAT

   Informative output:
       -h, --help
              display this help and exit

       -V, --version
              output version information and exit

       In  normal  operation mode, standard input is copied to standard output, with references to environment vari‐
       ables of the form $VARIABLE or ${VARIABLE} being replaced with the corresponding values.  If  a  SHELL-FORMAT
       is given, only those environment variables that are referenced in SHELL-FORMAT are substituted; otherwise all
       environment variables references occurring in standard input are substituted.

       When --variables is used, standard input is ignored, and the output consists  of  the  environment  variables
       that are referenced in SHELL-FORMAT, one per line.
