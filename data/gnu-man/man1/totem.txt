NAME
       Totem - GNOME desktop movie player based on GStreamer

SYNOPSIS
       totem [option...] [filenames|URI]

DESCRIPTION
       Totem  is  a  movie player for the GNOME desktop.  Through use of the GStreamer backend many popular file and
       streaming formats are supported including: MPEG audio and video (MP3/MPV), Ogg, AVI, ASF,  MOV,  WMV,  Quick‐
       Time,  and  more.   Playing  of  DVD  and VCD media is also possible.  Although primarily intended as a movie
       player, Totem can also play many audio formats.

       For additional documentation on interactive use of Totem select the Help menu option.  The menus allow access
       to some features not available through keybindings or command-line options.

OPTIONS
       -?, --help
              Output  a  longer  help message then quit.  (Any discrepancies between this man page and the output of
              totem --help should be reported as a documentation bug.)

       --version
              Output version information then quit.

       The following options command an already-running instance of Totem to  do  something;  they  are  useful  for
