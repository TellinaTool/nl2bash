NAME
       session-installer - allows applications to easily install and remove software

SYNOPSIS
       session-installer

DESCRIPTION
       Session-installer  allows  applications  to  easily  install additional software (e.g. extensions or GSreamer
       codecs), uninstall files and perform simple package status queries by calling a  distribution  neutral  D-Bus
       interface.

       The  whole process of confirmation, error reporting and progress notification is handled by sessioninstaller.
       Currently it comes only with a GTK based user interface.

       The D-Bus interface is developed under the PackageKit umbrella and is available on the session bus. The  ref‐
       erence implementation can be found in gnome-packagekit. It was also adpoted by KPackageKit.

       In contrast to gnome-packagekit and KPackageKit it doesn't use the PackageKit daemon for querying and instal‐
       lation, but instead makes use of APT and aptdaemon directly (alternatively synaptic can be used).

       Normally it is not required to start this programme manually since it makes use of D-Bus activation and  will
       be started on request automatically.

ENVIRONMENT
       SESSIONINSTALLER_BACKEND
              Set  the package manager which should be used for installation.  Possible values are aptdaemon, synap‐
              tic and dummy.
