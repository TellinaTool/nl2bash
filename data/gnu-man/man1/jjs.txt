NAME
       jjs - Invokes the Nashorn engine.

SYNOPSIS
           jjs [options] [script-files] [-- arguments]

       options
           One or more options of the jjs command, separated by spaces. For more information, see Options.

       script-files
           One or more script files which you want to interpret using Nashorn, separated by spaces. If no files are
           specified, an interactive shell is started.

       arguments
           All values after the double hyphen marker (--) are passed through to the script or the interactive shell
           as arguments. These values can be accessed by using the arguments property (see Example 3).

DESCRIPTION
       The jjs command-line tool is used to invoke the Nashorn engine. You can use it to interpret one or several
       script files, or to run an interactive shell.

OPTIONS
       The options of the jjs command control the conditions under which scripts are interpreted by Nashorn.

       -cp path
       -classpath path
           Specifies the path to the supporting class files To set multiple paths, the option can be repeated, or
           you can separate each path with a colon (:).

       -Dname=value
           Sets a system property to be passed to the script by assigning a value to a property name. The following
           example shows how to invoke Nashorn in interactive mode and assign myValue to the property named myKey:

               >> jjs -DmyKey=myValue
               jjs> java.lang.System.getProperty("myKey")
               myValue
               jjs>

           This option can be repeated to set multiple properties.

       -doe
       --dump-on-error
           Provides a full stack trace when an error occurs. By default, only a brief error message is printed.

       -fv
       --fullversion
           Prints the full Nashorn version string.

       -fx
           Launches the script as a JavaFX application.

       -h
       -help
           Prints the list of options and their descriptions.

       --language=[es5]
           Specifies the ECMAScript language version. The default version is ES5.

       -ot
       --optimistic-types=[true|false]
           Enables or disables optimistic type assumptions with deoptimizing recompilation. Running with optimistic
           types will yield higher final speed, but may increase warmup time.

       -scripting
           Enables shell scripting features.

       -strict
           Enables strict mode, which enforces stronger adherence to the standard (ECMAScript Edition 5.1), making
           it easier to detect common coding errors.

       -t=zone
       -timezone=zone
           Sets the specified time zone for script execution. It overrides the time zone set in the OS and used by
           the Date object.

       -v
       -version
           Prints the Nashorn version string.

EXAMPLES
       Example 1 Running a Script with Nashorn

               jjs script.js


       Example 2 Running Nashorn in Interactive Mode

               >> jjs
               jjs> println("Hello, World!")
               Hello, World!
               jjs> quit()
               >>


       Example 3 Passing Arguments to Nashorn

               >> jjs -- a b c
               jjs> arguments.join(", ")
               a, b, c
               jjs>
