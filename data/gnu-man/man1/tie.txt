NAME
       tie - merge or apply WEB change files

SYNOPSIS
       tie -c|-m outputfile masterfile changefile...

DESCRIPTION
       The  tie  program is used to process multiple change files used with the WEB system for literate programming.
       The WEB programs allow to apply patches to a source file (the masterfile) by means  of  a  number  of  change
       files  (often  only  a single change file is allowed).  Tie can be used to either merge up to 32 change files
       into a single one or to apply the changes to the masterfile in order to create a new one.  Output  of  either
       the new change file or the patched master file goes into outputfile.

OPTIONS
       -c     Create a single change file from the given changefiles.

       -m     Create a new master file by applying the given changefiles.

ENVIRONMENT
       The  environment variable WEBINPUTS is used to search for the input files, or the system default if WEBINPUTS
       is not set.  See tex(1) for the details of the searching.
