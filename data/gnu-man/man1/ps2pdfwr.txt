SYNOPSIS
       ps2pdfwr  [options...] {input.[e]ps|-} [output.pdf|-]

DESCRIPTION
       This wrapper script invokes gs(1) with following arguments

                                          -q -dNOPAUSE -dBATCH -sDEVICE=pdfwrite

       as  well  as  the appropriate -dOutputFile argument, all preceded and followed by any command-line arguments.
       Finally, the security option -dSAFER is prepended before all the other options.

       The version-specific ps2pdf scripts all invoke this one with the addition  of  the  respective  compatibility
