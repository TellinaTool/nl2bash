NAME
       pdftocairo - Portable Document Format (PDF) to PNG/JPEG/TIFF/PDF/PS/EPS/SVG using cairo

SYNOPSIS
       pdftocairo [options] PDF-file [output-file]

DESCRIPTION
       pdftocairo  converts  Portable  Document Format (PDF) files, using the cairo output device of the poppler PDF
       library, to any of the following output formats:

       ·      Portable Network Graphics (PNG)

       ·      JPEG Interchange Format (JPEG)

       ·      Tagged Image File Format (TIFF)

       ·      Portable Document Format (PDF)

       ·      PostScript (PS)

       ·      Encapsulated PostScript (EPS)

       ·      Scalable Vector Graphics (SVG)

       pdftocairo reads the PDF file, PDF-file, and writes to output-file.  The image formats (PNG, JPEG, and  TIFF)
       generate  one  file per page with the page number and file type appended to output-file (except when -single‐
       file is used).  When the output format is a vector format (PDF, PS, EPS, and  SVG)  or  when  -singlefile  is
       used, output-file is the full filename.

       If  the  PDF-file  is  “-” , the PDF is read from stdin.  If the output-file is “-” , the output file will be
       written to stdout. Using stdout is not valid with image formats unless -singlefile is used.   If  output-file
       is not used, the output filename will be derived from the PDF-file filename.

       Not  all  options  are  valid with all output formats. One (and only one) of the output format options (-png,
       -jpeg, -tiff, -pdf, -ps, -eps, or -svg) must be used.

       The resolution options (-r, -rx, -ry) set the resolution of the image output formats.  The  image  dimensions
       will depend on the PDF page size and the resolution. For the vector outputs, regions of the page that can not
       be represented natively in the output format (eg translucency in PS) will be  rasterized  at  the  resolution
       specified by the resolution options.

       The  -scale-to  options  may  be used to set a fixed image size. The image resolution will vary with the page
       size.

       The cropping options (-x, -y, -W, and -H) use units of pixels with the image formats  and  PostScript  points
       (1/72  inch) with the vector formats. When cropping is used with vector output the cropped region is centered
       unless -nocenter is used in which case the cropped region is at the top left (SVG) or bottom left  (PDF,  PS,
       EPS).

OPTIONS
       -png   Generates a PNG file(s)

       -jpeg  Generates a JPEG file(s)

       -tiff  Generates a TIFF file(s)

       -pdf   Generates a PDF file

       -ps    Generate a PS file

       -eps   Generate an EPS file. An EPS file contains a single image, so if you use this option with a multi-page
              PDF file, you must use -f and -l to specify a single page.  The  page  size  options  (-origpagesizes,
              -paper, -paperw, -paperh) can not be used with this option.

       -svg   Generate a SVG (Scalable Vector Graphics) file

       -f number
              Specifies the first page to convert.

       -l number
              Specifies the last page to convert.

       -o     Generates only the odd numbered pages.

       -e     Generates only the even numbered pages.

       -singlefile
              Writes only the first page and does not add digits.

       -r number
              Specifies  the  X and Y resolution, in pixels per inch of image files (or rasterized regions in vector
              output). The default is 150 PPI.

       -rx number
              Specifies the X resolution, in pixels per inch of image files (or rasterized regions  in  vector  out‐
              put). The default is 150 PPI.

       -ry number
              Specifies  the  Y  resolution, in pixels per inch of image files (or rasterized regions in vector out‐
              put). The default is 150 PPI.

       -scale-to number
              Scales the long side of each page (width for landscape pages, height for portrait  pages)  to  fit  in
              scale-to  pixels.  The  size  of  the  short  side  will be determined by the aspect ratio of the page
              (PNG/JPEG/TIFF only).

       -scale-to-x number
              Scales each page horizontally to fit in scale-to-x pixels. If scale-to-y is set to  -1,  the  vertical
              size will determined by the aspect ratio of the page (PNG/JPEG/TIFF only).

       -scale-to-y number
              Scales  each  page  vertically to fit in scale-to-y pixels. If scale-to-x is set to -1, the horizontal
              size will determined by the aspect ratio of the page (PNG/JPEG/TIFF only).

       -x number
              Specifies the x-coordinate of the crop area top left corner in pixels (image output) or points (vector
              output)

       -y number
              Specifies the y-coordinate of the crop area top left corner in pixels (image output) or points (vector
              output)

       -W number
              Specifies the width of crop area in pixels (image output) or points (vector output)  (default is 0)

       -H number
              Specifies the height of crop area in pixels (image output) or points (vector output)  (default is 0)

       -sz number
              Specifies the size of crop square in pixels (image output) or points (vector output)  (sets -W and -H)

       -cropbox
              Uses the crop box rather than media box when generating the files

       -mono  Generate a monochrome file (PNG and TIFF only).

       -gray  Generate a grayscale file (PNG, JPEG, and TIFF only).

       -transp
              Use a transparent page color instead of white (PNG and TIFF only).

       -icc icc-file
              Use the specified ICC file as the output profile (PNG only). The profile will be embedded in  the  PNG
              file.

       -level2
              Generate Level 2 PostScript (PS only).

       -level3
              Generate  Level  3  PostScript  (PS only). This enables all Level 2 features plus shading patterns and
              masked images. This is the default setting.

       -origpagesizes
              Generate a file with variable page sizes and orientations (PS and PDF only). The  size  of  each  page
              will  be the original page in the PDF file.  If the output is PS the file will contain %%DocumentMedia
              and %%PageMedia DSC comments specifying the size of each page.  Any specification of the page size via
              -paper,  -paperw,  or  -paperh  will get overridden as long as each page of the PDF file has a defined
              paper size.

       -paper size
              Set the paper size to one of "letter", "legal", "A4", or "A3" (PS,PDF,SVG only).  This can also be set
              to  "match", which will set the paper size to match the size specified in the PDF file. -origpagesizes
              overrides this setting if the PDF file has defined page sizes.

       -paperw size
              Set the paper width, in points (PS,PDF,SVG only). -origpagesizes overrides this  setting  if  the  PDF
              file has defined page sizes.

       -paperh size
              Set  the  paper  height, in points (PS,PDF,SVG only). -origpagesizes overrides this setting if the PDF
              file has defined page sizes.

       -nocrop
              By default, output is cropped to the CropBox specified in the PDF file.  This  option  disables  crop‐
              ping.

       -expand
              Expand  PDF pages smaller than the paper to fill the paper (PS,PDF,SVG only).  By default, these pages
              are not scaled.

       -noshrink
              Don't scale PDF pages which are larger than the paper (PS,PDF,SVG only).   By  default,  pages  larger
              than the paper are shrunk to fit.

       -nocenter
              By  default,  PDF  pages  smaller  than the paper (after any scaling) are centered on the paper.  This
              option causes them to be aligned to the lower-left corner of the paper instead (PS,PDF,SVG only).

       -duplex
              Adds the %%IncludeFeature: *Duplex DuplexNoTumble DSC comment to the PostScript file (PS only).   This
              tells the print manager to enable duplexing.

       -opw password
              Specify the owner password for the PDF file.  Providing this will bypass all security restrictions.

       -upw password
              Specify the user password for the PDF file.

       -q     Don't print any messages or errors.

       -v     Print copyright and version information.

       -h     Print usage information.  (-help and --help are equivalent.)

EXIT CODES
       The poppler tools use the following exit codes:

       0      No error.

       1      Error opening a PDF file.

       2      Error opening an output file.

       3      Error related to PDF permissions.

       4      Error related to ICC profile.

       99     Other error.
