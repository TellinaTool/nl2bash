NAME
       nlmconv - converts object code into an NLM.

SYNOPSIS
       nlmconv [-I bfdname|--input-target=bfdname]
               [-O bfdname|--output-target=bfdname]
               [-T headerfile|--header-file=headerfile]
               [-d|--debug] [-l linker|--linker=linker]
               [-h|--help] [-V|--version]
               infile outfile

DESCRIPTION
       nlmconv converts the relocatable i386 object file infile into the NetWare Loadable Module outfile, optionally
       reading headerfile for NLM header information.  For instructions on writing the NLM command file language
       used in header files, see the linkers section, NLMLINK in particular, of the NLM Development and Tools
       Overview, which is part of the NLM Software Developer's Kit ("NLM SDK"), available from Novell, Inc.  nlmconv
       uses the GNU Binary File Descriptor library to read infile;

       nlmconv can perform a link step.  In other words, you can list more than one object file for input if you
       list them in the definitions file (rather than simply specifying one input file on the command line).  In
       this case, nlmconv calls the linker for you.

OPTIONS
       -I bfdname
       --input-target=bfdname
           Object format of the input file.  nlmconv can usually determine the format of a given file (so no default
           is necessary).

       -O bfdname
       --output-target=bfdname
           Object format of the output file.  nlmconv infers the output format based on the input format, e.g. for a
           i386 input file the output format is nlm32-i386.

       -T headerfile
       --header-file=headerfile
           Reads headerfile for NLM header information.  For instructions on writing the NLM command file language
           used in header files, see see the linkers section, of the NLM Development and Tools Overview, which is
           part of the NLM Software Developer's Kit, available from Novell, Inc.

       -d
       --debug
           Displays (on standard error) the linker command line used by nlmconv.

       -l linker
       --linker=linker
           Use linker for any linking.  linker can be an absolute or a relative pathname.

       -h
       --help
           Prints a usage summary.

       -V
       --version
           Prints the version number for nlmconv.

       @file
           Read command-line options from file.  The options read are inserted in place of the original @file
           option.  If file does not exist, or cannot be read, then the option will be treated literally, and not
           removed.

           Options in file are separated by whitespace.  A whitespace character may be included in an option by
           surrounding the entire option in either single or double quotes.  Any character (including a backslash)
           may be included by prefixing the character to be included with a backslash.  The file may itself contain
           additional @file options; any such options will be processed recursively.
