NAME
       pdftosrc - extract source file or stream from PDF file

SYNOPSIS
       pdftosrc PDF-file [stream-object-number]

DESCRIPTION
       If only PDF-file is given as argument, pdftosrc extracts the embedded source file from the first found stream
       object with /Type /SourceFile within the PDF-file and writes it to  a  file  with  the  name  /SourceName  as
       defined in that PDF stream object (see application example below).

       If  both  PDF-file  and  stream-object-number  are  given as arguments, and stream-object-number is positive,
       pdftosrc extracts and uncompresses the PDF stream of the object given by its  stream-object-number  from  the
       PDF-file  and  writes  it to a file named PDF-file.stream-object-number with the ending .pdf or .PDF stripped
       from the original PDF-file name.

       A special case is related to XRef object streams that are part of the PDF standard from  PDF-1.5  onward:  If
       stream-object-number equals -1, then pdftosrc decompresses the XRef stream from the PDF file and writes it in
       human-readable PDF cross-reference table format to a file named PDF-file.xref (these XRef streams can not  be
       extracted just by giving their object number).

       In any case an existing file with the output file name will be overwritten.

OPTIONS
       None.

FILES
       Just the executable pdftosrc.

ENVIRONMENT
       None.

DIAGNOSTICS
       At success the exit code of pdftosrc is 0, else 1.

       All  messages go to stderr.  At program invocation, pdftosrc issues the current version number of the program
       xpdf, on which pdftosrc is based:

              pdftosrc version 3.01

       When pdftosrc was successful with the output file writing, one of the following messages will be issued:

              Source file extracted to source-file-name

       or

              Stream object extracted to PDF-file.stream-object-number

       or

              Cross-reference table extracted to PDF-file.xref


       When the object given by the stream-object-number does not contain a stream, pdftosrc  issues  the  following
       error message:

              Not a Stream object

       When the PDF-file can't be opened, the error message is:

              Error: Couldn't open file 'PDF-file'.

       When pdftosrc encounters an invalid PDF file, the error message (several lines) is:

              Error: May not be a PDF file (continuing anyway)
              (more lines)
              Invalid PDF file

       There are also more error messages from pdftosrc for various kinds of broken PDF files.

NOTES
       An embedded source file will be written out unchanged, i. e. it will not be uncompressed in this process.

       Only the stream of the object will be written, i. e. not the dictionary of that object.

       Knowing  which  stream-object-number  to  query requires information about the PDF file that has to be gained
       elsewhere, e. g. by looking into the PDF file with an editor.

       The stream extraction capabilities of pdftosrc (e. g. regarding understood PDF  versions  and  filter  types)
       follow the capabilities of the underlying xpdf program version.

       Currently the generation number of the stream object is not supported.  The default value 0 (zero) is taken.

       The wording stream-object-number has nothing to do with the `object streams' introduced by the Adobe PDF Ref‐
       erence, 5th edition, version 1.6.

EXAMPLES
       When using pdftex, a source file can be embedded into some PDF-file by using  pdftex  primitives,  as  illus‐
       trated by the following example:

       \immediate\pdfobj
           stream attr {/Type /SourceFile /SourceName (myfile.zip)}
           file{myfile.zip}
       \pdfcatalog{/SourceObject \the\pdflastobj\space 0 R}

       Then this zip file can be extracted from the PDF-file by calling pdftosrc PDF-file.

BUGS
       Not all embedded source files will be extracted, only the first found one.
