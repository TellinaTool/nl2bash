NAME
       ppmtopcx - convert a portable pixmap into a PCX file


SYNOPSIS
       ppmtopcx [-24bit] [-packed] [-xpos=cols] [-ypos=rows] [ppmfile]


DESCRIPTION
       Reads  a  PPM image as input.  Produces a PCX file as output.  The type of the PCX file depends on the number
       of colors in the pixmap:

       16 colors or less:
              1 bit/pixel, 1-4 planes.

       256 colors or less:
              8 bits/pixel, 1 plane, colormap at the end of the file.

       More than 256 colors:
              24bit truecolor file (8 bits/pixel, 3 planes).

OPTIONS
       -24bit Produce a 24bit truecolor file, even if the pixmap has 256 colors or less.

       -packed
              Use "packed pixel" format for files with 16 colors or less: 1, 2, or 4 bits/pixel, 1 plane.

       -xpos=cols

       -ypos=rows
              These options set the position of the image in some field (e.g. on a screen) in columns to  the  right
              of  the  left  edge  and rows below the top edge.  The PCX format contains image position information.
              Don't confuse this with the position of an area of interest within the image.  For example, using pnm‐
              pad  to  add a 10 pixel left border to an image and then converting that image to PCX with xpos = 0 is
              not the same as converting the original image to PCX and setting xpos = 10.

              The values may be from -32767 to 32768.

              The default for each is zero.
