DH_INSTALLCATALOGS(1)                                 Debhelper                                DH_INSTALLCATALOGS(1)



NAME
       dh_installcatalogs - install and register SGML Catalogs

SYNOPSIS
       dh_installcatalogs [debhelper options] [-n]

DESCRIPTION
       dh_installcatalogs is a debhelper program that installs and registers SGML catalogs. It complies with the
       Debian XML/SGML policy.

       Catalogs will be registered in a supercatalog, in /etc/sgml/package.cat.

       This command automatically adds maintainer script snippets for registering and unregistering the catalogs and
       supercatalogs (unless -n is used). These snippets are inserted into the maintainer scripts by dh_installdeb;
       see dh_installdeb(1) for an explanation of Debhelper maintainer script snippets.

       A dependency on sgml-base will be added to ${misc:Depends}, so be sure your package uses that variable in
       debian/control.

FILES
       debian/package.sgmlcatalogs
           Lists the catalogs to be installed per package. Each line in that file should be of the form "source
           dest", where source indicates where the catalog resides in the source tree, and dest indicates the
           destination location for the catalog under the package build area. dest should start with
           /usr/share/sgml/.

OPTIONS
       -n, --noscripts
           Do not modify postinst/postrm/prerm scripts.

NOTES
       Note that this command is not idempotent. dh_prep(1) should be called between invocations of this command.
       Otherwise, it may cause multiple instances of the same text to be added to maintainer scripts.
