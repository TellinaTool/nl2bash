SGML2XML(1)                                                                                              SGML2XML(1)



NAME
       sgml2xml - convert SGML to XML

       An SGML System Conforming to International Standard ISO 8879 — Standard Generalized Markup Language

SYNOPSIS
       sgml2xml  [  -Cehilprvx ]  [ -bencoding ]  [ -ccatalog ]  [ -Ddir ]  [ -ffile ]  [ -iname ]  [ -wwarning ]  [
       -xxml-output-option ]  sysid...

DESCRIPTION
       sgml2xml converts SGML to XML.  sgml2xml parses and validates the SGML document  contained  in  sysid...  and
       writes an equivalent XML document to the standard output. sgml2xml will warn about SGML constructs which have
       no XML equivalent.

OPTIONS
       -bencoding
              Use encoding for output.  The default is UTF-8. See nsgmls(1) for the possible encoding types.

       -ccatalog
              Use the catalog entry file file.

       -C     The filename... arguments specify catalog files rather than the document entity. The  document  entity
              is specified by the first DOCUMENT entry in the catalog files.

       -Ddirectory
              Search  directory  for  files  specified  in  system identifiers. Multiple -D options are allowed. See
              nsgmls(1) for more information about this option.

       -e     Describe open entities in error messages.

       -ffile Redirect errors to file.  This is useful only for shells that do not support redirection of stderr.

       -iname Pretend that <!ENTITY % name "INCLUDE"> occurs at the start of the document type declaration subset in
              the  SGML  document  entity. Since repeated definitions of an entity are ignored, this definition will
              take precedence over any other definitions of this entity in the document type  declaration.  Multiple
              -i  options  are  allowed.  If  the  SGML  declaration replaces the reserved name INCLUDE then the new
              reserved name will be the replacement text of the entity. Typically the document type declaration will
              contain  <!ENTITY % name "IGNORE"> and will use %name; in the status keyword specification of a marked
              section declaration. In this case the effect of the option will be to cause the marked section not  to
              be ignored.

       -v     Print the version number.

       -wtype Control warnings and errors according to type.  See nsgmls(1) for the allowed values of type.

       -xxml-output-option
              Control the XML output, according to the value of xml_output_option as follows:

              no-nl-in-tag
                     Don't use newlines inside start-tags. Usually sgml2xml uses newlines inside start-tags so as to
                     reduce the probability of excessively long lines.

              id     Output attribute declarations for ID attributes.

              notation
                     Output declarations for notations.

              ndata  Output declarations for external data entities. XML requires these to be NDATA.  sgml2xml  will
                     warn about CDATA and SDATA external data entities and output them as NDATA entities.

              cdata  Use  XML  CDATA  sections for CDATA marked sections and for elements with a declared content of
                     CDATA.

              comment
                     Output comment declarations. Comment declarations in the DTD will not be output.

              lower  Prefer lower case. Names that were subjected to upper-case substitution by SGML will be  folded
                     to lower case. This does not include reserved names; XML requires these to be in upper-case.

              pi-escape
                     Escape  &<>  in the contents of processing instructions using the amp, lt and gt entities. This
                     allows processing instructions to contain the string >?, but requires that applications  handle
                     the escapes.

              empty  Use the <e/> syntax for element types e declared as EMPTY.

              attlist
                     Output  a  ATTLIST  declaration  for  every  element specifying the type of all attributes. The
                     default will always be #IMPLIED.

       Multiple -x options are allowed.
