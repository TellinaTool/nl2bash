NAME
       dh_install - install files into package build directories

SYNOPSIS
       dh_install [-Xitem] [--autodest] [--sourcedir=dir] [debhelper options] [file|dir ... destdir]

DESCRIPTION
       dh_install is a debhelper program that handles installing files into package build directories. There are
       many dh_install* commands that handle installing specific types of files such as documentation, examples, man
       pages, and so on, and they should be used when possible as they often have extra intelligence for those
       particular tasks. dh_install, then, is useful for installing everything else, for which no particular
       intelligence is needed. It is a replacement for the old dh_movefiles command.

       This program may be used in one of two ways. If you just have a file or two that the upstream Makefile does
       not install for you, you can run dh_install on them to move them into place. On the other hand, maybe you
       have a large package that builds multiple binary packages. You can use the upstream Makefile to install it
       all into debian/tmp, and then use dh_install to copy directories and files from there into the proper package
       build directories.

       From debhelper compatibility level 7 on, dh_install will fall back to looking in debian/tmp for files, if it
       doesn't find them in the current directory (or whereever you've told it to look using --sourcedir).

FILES
       debian/package.install
           List the files to install into each package and the directory they should be installed to. The format is
           a set of lines, where each line lists a file or files to install, and at the end of the line tells the
           directory it should be installed in. The name of the files (or directories) to install should be given
           relative to the current directory, while the installation directory is given relative to the package
           build directory. You may use wildcards in the names of the files to install (in v3 mode and above).

           Note that if you list exactly one filename or wildcard-pattern on a line by itself, with no explicit
           destination, then dh_install will automatically guess the destination to use, the same as if the
           --autodest option were used.

OPTIONS
       --list-missing
           This option makes dh_install keep track of the files it installs, and then at the end, compare that list
           with the files in the source directory. If any of the files (and symlinks) in the source directory were
           not installed to somewhere, it will warn on stderr about that.

           This may be useful if you have a large package and want to make sure that you don't miss installing newly
           added files in new upstream releases.

           Note that files that are excluded from being moved via the -X option are not warned about.

       --fail-missing
           This option is like --list-missing, except if a file was missed, it will not only list the missing files,
           but also fail with a nonzero exit code.

       -Xitem, --exclude=item
           Exclude files that contain item anywhere in their filename from being installed.

       --sourcedir=dir
           Look in the specified directory for files to be installed.

           Note that this is not the same as the --sourcedirectory option used by the dh_auto_* commands. You rarely
           need to use this option, since dh_install automatically looks for files in debian/tmp in debhelper
           compatibility level 7 and above.

       --autodest
           Guess as the destination directory to install things to. If this is specified, you should not list
           destination directories in debian/package.install files or on the command line. Instead, dh_install will
           guess as follows:

           Strip off debian/tmp (or the sourcedir if one is given) from the front of the filename, if it is present,
           and install into the dirname of the filename. So if the filename is debian/tmp/usr/bin, then that
           directory will be copied to debian/package/usr/. If the filename is debian/tmp/etc/passwd, it will be
           copied to debian/package/etc/.

       file|dir ... destdir
           Lists files (or directories) to install and where to install them to.  The files will be installed into
           the first package dh_install acts on.

LIMITATIONS
       dh_install cannot rename files or directories, it can only install them with the names they already have into
       wherever you want in the package build tree.
