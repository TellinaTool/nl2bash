NAME
       time - run programs and summarize system resource usage

SYNOPSIS
       time   [ -apqvV ] [ -f FORMAT ] [ -o FILE ]
              [ --append ] [ --verbose ] [ --quiet ] [ --portability ]
              [ --format=FORMAT ] [ --output=FILE ] [ --version ]
              [ --help ] COMMAND [ ARGS ]

DESCRIPTION
       time run the program COMMAND with any given arguments ARG....  When COMMAND finishes, time displays
       information about resources used by COMMAND (on the standard error output, by default).  If COMMAND exits
       with non-zero status, time displays a warning message and the exit status.

       time determines which information to display about the resources used by the COMMAND from the string FORMAT.
       If no format is specified on the command line, but the TIME environment variable is set, its value is used as
       the format.  Otherwise, a default format built into time is used.

       Options to time must appear on the command line before COMMAND.  Anything on the command line after COMMAND
       is passed as arguments to COMMAND.


OPTIONS
       -o FILE, --output=FILE
              Write the resource use statistics to FILE instead of to the standard error stream.  By default, this
              overwrites the file, destroying the file's previous contents.  This option is useful for collecting
              information on interactive programs and programs that produce output on the standard error stream.

       -a, --append
              Append the resource use information to the output file instead of overwriting it.  This option is only
              useful with the `-o' or `--output' option.

       -f FORMAT, --format FORMAT
              Use FORMAT as the format string that controls the output of time.  See the below more information.

       --help Print a summary of the command line options and exit.

       -p, --portability
              Use the following format string, for conformance with POSIX standard 1003.2:
                        real %e
                        user %U
                        sys %S

       -v, --verbose
              Use the built-in verbose format, which displays each available piece of information on the program's
              resource use on its own line, with an English description of its meaning.

       --quiet
              Do not report the status of the program even if it is different from zero.

       -V, --version
              Print the version number of time and exit.


FORMATTING THE OUTPUT
       The format string FORMAT controls the contents of the time output.  The format string can be set using the
       `-f' or `--format', `-v' or `--verbose', or `-p' or `--portability' options.  If they are not given, but the
       TIME environment variable is set, its value is used as the format string.  Otherwise, a built-in default
       format is used.  The default format is:
         %Uuser %Ssystem %Eelapsed %PCPU (%Xtext+%Ddata %Mmax)k
         %Iinputs+%Ooutputs (%Fmajor+%Rminor)pagefaults %Wswaps

       The format string usually consists of `resource specifiers' interspersed with plain text.  A percent sign
       (`%') in the format string causes the following character to be interpreted as a resource specifier, which is
       similar to the formatting characters in the printf(3) function.

       A backslash (`\') introduces a `backslash escape', which is translated into a single printing character upon
       output.  `\t' outputs a tab character, `\n' outputs a newline, and `\\' outputs a backslash.  A backslash
       followed by any other character outputs a question mark (`?') followed by a backslash, to indicate that an
       invalid backslash escape was given.

       Other text in the format string is copied verbatim to the output.  time always prints a newline after
       printing the resource use information, so normally format strings do not end with a newline character (or
       `\n').

       There are many resource specifications.  Not all resources are measured by all versions of Unix, so some of
       the values might be reported as zero.  Any character following a percent sign that is not listed in the table
       below causes a question mark (`?') to be output, followed by that character, to indicate that an invalid
       resource specifier was given.

       The resource specifiers, which are a superset of those recognized by the tcsh(1) builtin `time' command, are:
              %      A literal `%'.
              C      Name and command line arguments of the command being timed.
              D      Average size of the process's unshared data area, in Kilobytes.
              E      Elapsed real (wall clock) time used by the process, in [hours:]minutes:seconds.
              F      Number of major, or I/O-requiring, page faults that occurred while the process was running.
                     These are faults where the page has actually migrated out of primary memory.
              I      Number of file system inputs by the process.
              K      Average total (data+stack+text) memory use of the process, in Kilobytes.
              M      Maximum resident set size of the process during its lifetime, in Kilobytes.
              O      Number of file system outputs by the process.
              P      Percentage of the CPU that this job got.  This is just user + system times divided by the total
                     running time.  It also prints a percentage sign.
              R      Number of minor, or recoverable, page faults.  These are pages that are not valid (so they
                     fault) but which have not yet been claimed by other virtual pages.  Thus the data in the page
                     is still valid but the system tables must be updated.
              S      Total number of CPU-seconds used by the system on behalf of the process (in kernel mode), in
                     seconds.
              U      Total number of CPU-seconds that the process used directly (in user mode), in seconds.
              W      Number of times the process was swapped out of main memory.
              X      Average amount of shared text in the process, in Kilobytes.
              Z      System's page size, in bytes.  This is a per-system constant, but varies between systems.
              c      Number of times the process was context-switched involuntarily (because the time slice
                     expired).
              e      Elapsed real (wall clock) time used by the process, in seconds.
              k      Number of signals delivered to the process.
              p      Average unshared stack size of the process, in Kilobytes.
              r      Number of socket messages received by the process.
              s      Number of socket messages sent by the process.
              t      Average resident set size of the process, in Kilobytes.
              w      Number of times that the program was context-switched voluntarily, for instance while waiting
                     for an I/O operation to complete.
              x      Exit status of the command.

EXAMPLES
       To run the command `wc /etc/hosts' and show the default information:
            time wc /etc/hosts

       To run the command `ls -Fs' and show just the user, system, and total time:
            time -f "\t%E real,\t%U user,\t%S sys" ls -Fs

       To edit the file BORK and have `time' append the elapsed time and number of signals to the file `log',
       reading the format string from the environment variable `TIME':
            export TIME="\t%E,\t%k" # If using bash or ksh
            setenv TIME "\t%E,\t%k" # If using csh or tcsh
            time -a -o log emacs bork

       Users of the bash shell need to use an explicit path in order to run the external time command and not the
       shell builtin variant.  On system where time is installed in /usr/bin, the first example would become
            /usr/bin/time wc /etc/hosts

ACCURACY
       The elapsed time is not collected atomically with the execution of the program; as a result, in bizarre
       circumstances (if the time command gets stopped or swapped out in between when the program being timed exits
       and when time calculates how long it took to run), it could be much larger than the actual execution time.

       When the running time of a command is very nearly zero, some values (e.g., the percentage of CPU used) may be
       reported as either zero (which is wrong) or a question mark.

       Most information shown by time is derived from the wait3(2) system call.  The numbers are only as good as
       those returned by wait3(2).  On systems that do not have a wait3(2) call that returns status information, the
       times(2) system call is used instead.  However, it provides much less information than wait3(2), so on those
       systems time reports the majority of the resources as zero.

       The `%I' and `%O' values are allegedly only `real' input and output and do not include those supplied by
       caching devices.  The meaning of `real' I/O reported by `%I' and `%O' may be muddled for workstations,
       especially diskless ones.

DIAGNOSTICS
       The time command returns when the program exits, stops, or is terminated by a signal.  If the program exited
       normally, the return value of time is the return value of the program it executed and measured.  Otherwise,
       the return value is 128 plus the number of the signal which caused the program to stop or terminate.
