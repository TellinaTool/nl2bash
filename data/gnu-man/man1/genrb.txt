GENRB(1)                                           ICU 52.1 Manual                                          GENRB(1)



NAME
       genrb - compile a resource bundle

SYNOPSIS
       genrb [ -h, -?, --help ] [ -V, --version ] [ -v, --verbose ] [ -e, --encoding encoding ] [ -j, --write-java [
       encoding ] ] [ -s, --sourcedir source ] [ -d, --destdir destination ] [ -i, --icudatadir directory  ]  bundle
       ...

DESCRIPTION
       genrb  converts the resource bundle source files passed on the command line to their binary form or to a Java
       source file for use with ICU4J.  The resulting binary files have  a  .res  extension  while  resource  bundle
       source  files  typically  have a .txt extension. Java source files have a java extension and follow the ICU4J
       naming conventions.

       It is customary to name the resource bundles by their locale name, i.e. to use a  local  identifier  for  the
       bundle  filename,  e.g.   ja_JP.txt for Japanese (Japan) data, or root.txt for the root bundle.  In any case,
       genrb will produce a file whose base name is the name of the locale found in the resource file, not the  base
       name of the resource file itself.

       The  binary  files can be read directly by ICU, or used by pkgdata(1) for incorporation into a larger archive
       or library.

OPTIONS
       -h, -?, --help
              Print help about usage and exit.

       -V, --version
              Print the version of genrb and exit.

       -v, --verbose
              Display extra informative messages during execution.

       -e, --encoding encoding
              Set the encoding used to read input files to encoding.  The default encoding is the invariant  (subset
              of  ASCII or EBCDIC) codepage for the system (see section INVARIANT CHARACTERS).  The encodings UTF-8,
              UTF-16BE, and UTF-16LE are automatically detected if a byte order mark (BOM) is present.

       -j, --write-java [ encoding ]
              Generate a Java source code for use with ICU4J. An optional encoding for the Java file can be given.

       -s, --sourcedir source
              Set the source directory to source.  The default source directory  is  specified  by  the  environment
              variable ICU_DATA, or the location set when ICU was built if ICU_DATA is not set.

       -d, --destdir destination
              Set  the  destination directory to destination.  The default destination directory is specified by the
              environment variable ICU_DATA or is the location set when ICU was built if ICU_DATA is not set.

       -i, --icudatadir directory
              Look for any necessary ICU data files in directory.  For example, when processing collation overrides,
              the  file ucadata.dat must be located.  The default ICU data directory is specified by the environment
              variable ICU_DATA.

INVARIANT CHARACTERS
       The invariant character set consists of the following set of characters, expressed as a standard POSIX  regu‐
       lar  expression:  [a-z]|[A-Z]|[0-9]|_| |+|-|*|/.  This is the set which is guaranteed to be available regard‐
       less of code page.

ENVIRONMENT
       ICU_DATA  Specifies the directory containing ICU data. Defaults to ${prefix}/share/icu/52.1/.  Some tools  in
                 ICU  depend  on  the  presence  of the trailing slash. It is thus important to make sure that it is
                 present if ICU_DATA is set.

VERSION
       52.1
