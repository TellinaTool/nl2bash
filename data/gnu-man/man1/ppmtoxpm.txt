NAME
       ppmtoxpm - convert a portable pixmap into an X11 pixmap


SYNOPSIS
       ppmtoxpm [-name=xpmname] [-rgb=rgb-textfile] [-alphamask=pgmfile] [ppmfile]

       Minimum unique abbrevations are acceptable.


DESCRIPTION
       Reads  a portable pixmap as input.  Produces X11 pixmap (version 3) as output which can be loaded directly by
       the XPM library.


       For example, to convert the file "dot" (found in /usr/include/X11/bitmaps), from xbm to xpm one could specify

              xbmtopbm dot | ppmtoxpm -name dot

       or, with a rgb text file (in the local directory)

              xbmtopbm dot | ppmtoxpm -name dot -rgb rgb.txt


OPTIONS
       -name=xpmname
              The -name option allows you to specify the prefix string which is printed in the resulting XPM output.
              If  not specified, will default to the filename (without extension) of the <ppmfile> argument.  If you
              do not specify -name or ppmfile, (i.e. your input is from Standad Input), the prefix  string  defaults
              to the string noname.

       rgb=rgb-textfile
              The  -rgb  option  allows  you to specify an X11 rgb text file for the lookup of color name mnemonics.
              This rgb text file is typically the /usr/lib/X11/rgb.txt of the MIT X11  distribution,  but  any  file
              using  the  same  format may be used.  When specified and a RGB value from the ppm input matches a RGB
              value from the <rgb-textfile>, then the corresponding color name mnemonic is printed in the XPM's col‐
              ormap.   If  you don't specify -rgb or if the RGB values don't match, then ppmtoxpm produces the color
              specifications in the #RGB, #RRGGBB, #RRRGGGBBB, or #RRRRGGGGBBBB hexadecimal format.


       -alphamask=pgmfile
              This option names a PGM file to use as an alpha (transparency) mask.  The file must contain  an  image
              the same dimensions as the input image.  ppmtoxpm marks as transparent any pixel whose position in the
              alpha mask image is at most half white.

              If you don't specify -alphamask, ppmtoxpm makes all pixels in the output opaque.

              ppmcolormask is one way to generate an alpha mask file.  You might  also  generate  it  by  extracting
              transparency  information  from  an XPM file with the -alphaout option to xpmtoppm.  There are similar
              options on other Netpbm converters that convert from formats  that  include  transparency  information
              too.


LIMITATIONS
       An option to match the closest (rather than exact) color name mnemonic from the rgb text would be a desirable
       enhancement.

       Truncation of the least significant bits of a RGB value may result in nonexact matches when performing  color
       name mnemonic lookups.
