UXTERM(1)                                          X Window System                                         UXTERM(1)



NAME
       uxterm - X terminal emulator for Unicode (UTF-8) environments

SYNOPSIS
       uxterm [ xterm-options ]

DESCRIPTION
       uxterm  is a wrapper around the xterm(1) program that invokes the latter program with the “UXTerm” X resource
       class set.  All arguments to uxterm are passed to xterm without processing; the -class and -u8 options should
       not  be  specified  because  they are used by the wrapper.  See the xterm manual page for more information on
       xterm-options.

       The environment's locale settings (see “ENVIRONMENT” below) are used to discern the locale's  character  set.
       If  no current locale can be determined, the locale “en_US” (the English language as used in the territory of
       the United States) is assumed.  The locale(1) utility is used to determine whether the  system  supports  the
       selected locale.  If it does not, uxterm will exit with an error and report the output of locale.

       Note:  uxterm may produce unexpected results if the current locale is set to one in which the UTF-8 character
       encoding is not supported, or if fonts using the ISO 10646-1 character set are not available.  In the  Debian
       system, the “xfonts-base” package provides the fonts that uxterm uses by default.  To change the fonts uxterm
       uses, edit the /etc/X11/app-defaults/UXTerm file.

       A similar wrapper, koi8rxterm(1), is available for KOI8-R environments.

ENVIRONMENT
       LC_ALL, LC_CTYPE, LANG
              The values of these variables are checked, in order, to determine the character set used by  the  cur‐
              rent locale.
