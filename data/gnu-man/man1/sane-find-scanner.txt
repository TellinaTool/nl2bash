NAME
       sane-find-scanner - find SCSI and USB scanners and their device files

SYNOPSIS
       sane-find-scanner [-h|-?]  [-v] [-q] [-p] [-f] [-F filename] [devname]


DESCRIPTION
       sane-find-scanner is a command-line tool to find SCSI and USB scanners and determine their Unix device files.
       Its primary aim is to make sure that scanners can be detected by SANE backends.

       For SCSI scanners, it checks the default generic SCSI device files (e.g., /dev/sg0)  and  /dev/scanner.   The
       test  is  done  by  sending  a SCSI inquiry command and looking for a device type of "scanner" or "processor"
       (some old HP scanners seem to send "processor"). So sane-find-scanner will find any SCSI scanner connected to
       those default device files even if it isn't supported by any SANE backend.

       For  USB scanners, first the USB kernel scanner device files (e.g.  /dev/usb/scanner0), /dev/usb/scanner, and
       /dev/usbscanner) are tested. The files are opened and the vendor and device ids are determined, if the  oper‐
       ating  system  supports this feature. Currently USB scanners are only found this way if they are supported by
       the Linux scanner module or the FreeBSD or OpenBSD uscanner driver. After that test, sane-find-scanner  tries
       to  scan  for  USB  devices found by the USB library libusb (if available). There is no special USB class for
       scanners,  so  the  heuristics  used  to  distinguish  scanners  from  other  USB  devices  is  not  perfect.
       sane-find-scanner  also  tries  to find out the type of USB chip used in the scanner. If detected, it will be
       printed after the vendor and product ids.  sane-find-scanner will even find USB scanners, that are  not  sup‐
       ported by any SANE backend.

       sane-find-scanner  won't  find  most parallel port scanners, or scanners connected to proprietary ports. Some
       parallel port scanners may be detected by sane-find-scanner -p.  At the time of writing this will only detect
       Mustek parallel port scanners.


OPTIONS
       -h, -?  Prints a short usage message.

       -v      Verbose output. If used once, sane-find-scanner shows every device name and the test result.  If used
               twice, SCSI inquiry information and the USB device descriptors are also printed.

       -q      Be quiet. Print only the devices, no comments.

       -p      Probe parallel port scanners.

       -f      Force opening all explicitly given devices as SCSI and USB devices. That's useful if  sane-find-scan‐
               ner is wrong in determining the device type.

       -F filename
               filename  is  a  file that contains USB descriptors in the format of /proc/bus/usb/devices as used by
               Linux.  sane-find-scanner tries to identify the chipset(s) of all USB scanners found in such a  file.
               This  option is useful for developers when the output of "cat /proc/bus/usb/devices" is available but
               the scanner itself isn't.

       devname Test device file "devname". No other devices are checked if devname is given.

EXAMPLE
       sane-find-scanner -v
       Check all SCSI and USB devices for available scanners and print a line for every device file.

       sane-find-scanner /dev/scanner
       Look for a (SCSI) scanner only at /dev/scanner and print the result.

       sane-find-scanner -p
       Probe for parallel port scanners.

SUPPORTED PLATFORMS
       USB support is limited to Linux (kernel, libusb), FreeBSD (kernel, libusb), NetBSD (libusb), OpenBSD (kernel,
       libusb). Detecting the vendor and device ids only works with Linux or libusb.

       SCSI support is available on Irix, EMX, Linux, Next, AIX, Solaris, FreeBSD, NetBSD, OpenBSD, and HP-UX.


BUGS
       No support for most parallel port scanners yet.
       Detection of USB chipsets is limited to a few chipsets.
