       pbmmake [-white|-black|-gray ] width height

DESCRIPTION
       Produces a portable bitmap of the specified width and height.  The color defaults to white.

OPTIONS
       In addition to the usual -white and -black, this program implements -gray.  This gives a simple 50% gray pat‐
       tern with 1's and 0's alternating.
