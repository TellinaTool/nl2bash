DESCRIPTION
       luaotfload-tool  accesses  the  font names database that is required by the Luaotfload package. There are two
       general modes: update and query.

       · update:  update the database or rebuild it entirely;

       · query:   resolve a font name or display close matches.

       Note that if the script is named mkluatexfontdb it will behave  like  earlier  versions  (<=1.3)  and  always
       update the database first. Also, the verbosity level will be set to 2.

OPTIONS
   update mode
       --update, -u
              Update the database; indexes new fonts.

       --force, -f
              Force rebuilding of the database; re-indexes all fonts.

       --no-reload, -n
              Suppress auto-updates to the database (e.g.  when --find is passed an unknown name).

       --no-strip
              Do  not  strip redundant information after building the database. Warning: this will inflate the index
              to about two to three times the normal size.

       --no-compress, -c
              Do not filter the plain text version of the font index through gzip. Useful for debugging if your edi‐
              tor is built without zlib.

       --prefer-texmf, -p
              Organize  the  file name database in a way so that it prefer fonts in the TEXMF tree over system fonts
              if they are installed in both.

       --max-fonts=N
              Process at most N font files, including fonts already indexed in the count.

       --formats=EXTENSIONS
              Extensions of the font files to index.  Where EXTENSIONS is a comma-separated list of  supported  file
              extensions  (otf,  ttf,  ttc,  dfont, pfa, and pfb).  If the list is prefixed with a + sign, the given
              list is added to the currently active one; - subtracts.  Default: otf,ttf,ttc,dfont.  Examples:

              1. --formats=-ttc,ttf would skip TrueType fonts and font collections;

              2. --formats=otf would scan only OpenType files;

              3. --formats=+pfb includes binary Postscript files. Warning: with a  standard  TeX  Live  installation
                 this will grow the database considerably and slow down font indexing.

       --dry-run, -D
              Don’t load fonts, scan directories only.  (For debugging file system related issues.)

   query mode
       --find=NAME
              Resolve  a  font  name; this looks up <name> in the database and prints the file name it is mapped to.
              --find also understands request syntax, i.e. --find=file:foo.otf checks whether foo.otf is indexed.

       --fuzzy, -F
              Show approximate matches to the file name if the lookup was unsuccessful (requires --find).

       --info, -i
              Display basic information to a resolved font file (requires --find).

       --inspect, -I
              Display detailed information by loading the font and analyzing the font table;  very  slow!   For  the
              meaning of the returned fields see the LuaTeX documentation.  (requires --find).

       --warnings, -w
              Print the warnings generated by the fontloader library (assumes -I). Automatically enabled if the ver‐
              bosity level exceeds 2.

       --show-blacklist, -b
              Show blacklisted files (not directories).

       --list=CRITERION
              Show entries, where CRITERION is one of the following:

              1. the character *, selecting all entries;

              2. a field of a database entry, for instance version or format*, according to which the output will be
                 sorted.   Information  in  an unstripped database (see the option --no-strip above) is nested: Sub‐
                 fields  of  a  record  can  be  addressed  using  the  ->   separator,   e.   g.    file->location,
                 style->units_per_em,  or  names->sanitized->english->prefmodifiers.  NB: shell syntax requires that
                 arguments containing -> be properly quoted!

              3. an expression of the form field:value to limit the output to entries whose field matches value.

              For example, in order to output file names and corresponding versions, sorted by the font format:

                 ./luaotfload-tool.lua --list="format" --fields="file->base,version"

              This prints:

                 otf latinmodern-math.otf  Version 1.958
                 otf lmromancaps10-oblique.otf 2.004
                 otf lmmono8-regular.otf 2.004
                 otf lmmonoproplt10-bold.otf 2.004
                 otf lmsans10-oblique.otf  2.004
                 otf lmromanslant8-regular.otf 2.004
                 otf lmroman12-italic.otf  2.004
                 otf lmsansdemicond10-oblique.otf  2.004
                 ...

       --fields=FIELDS
              Comma-separated list of fields that should be printed.  Information in an unstripped database (see the
              option  --no-strip above) is nested: Subfields of a record can be addressed using the -> separator, e.
              g.  file->location, style->units_per_em,  or  names->sanitized->english->subfamily.   The  default  is
              plainname,version*.  (Only meaningful with --list.)

   font and lookup caches
       --flush-lookups
              Clear font name lookup cache (experimental).

       --cache=DIRECTIVE
              Cache control, where DIRECTIVE is one of the following:

              1. purge -> delete Lua files from cache;

              2. erase -> delete Lua and Luc files from cache;

              3. show  -> print stats.

   miscellaneous
       --verbose=N, -v
              Set verbosity level to n or the number of repetitions of -v.

       --quiet
              No verbose output (log level set to zero).

       --log=CHANNEL
              Redirect log output (for database troubleshooting), where CHANNEL can be

              1. stdout -> all output will be dumped to the terminal; or

              2. file  -> write to a file to the temporary directory (the name will be chosen automatically (experi‐
                 mental!).

       --version, -V
              Show version info of components and exit.

       --help, -h
              Show help message and exit.

       --diagnose=CHECK
              Run the diagnostic procedure CHECK. Available procedures are:

              1. files -> check Luaotfload files for modifications;

              2. permissions -> check permissions of cache directories and files;

              3.

                 environment -> print relevant
                        environment and kpse variables;

              4. repository -> check the git repository for new releases,

              5. index -> check database, display information about it.

              Procedures can be chained by concatenating with commas,  e.g.  --diagnose=files,permissions.   Specify
              thorough to run all checks.

FILES
       The font name database is usually located in the directory texmf-var/luatex-cache/generic/names/ ($TEXMFCACHE
       as set in texmf.cnf) of your TeX Live distribution as a zlib-compressed  file  luaotfload-names.lua.gz.   The
       experimental  lookup  cache  will be created as luaotfload-lookup-cache.lua in the same directory.  These Lua
       tables are not used directly by Luaotfload, though.  Instead, they are compiled  to  Lua  bytecode  which  is
       written  to  corresponding  files with the extension .luc in the same directory.  When modifying the files by
       hand keep in mind that only if the bytecode files are missing will Luaotfload use the plain version  instead.
       Both kinds of files are safe to delete, at the cost of regenerating them with the next run of LuaTeX.
