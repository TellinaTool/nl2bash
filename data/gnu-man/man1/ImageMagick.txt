NAME
       ImageMagick - is a free software suite for the creation, modification and display of bitmap images.

SYNOPSIS
       convert input-file [options] output-file

OVERVIEW
       ImageMagick®,  is a software suite to create, edit, and compose bitmap images. It can read, convert and write
       images in a variety of formats (about 100) including GIF, JPEG, JPEG-2000, PNG, PDF, PhotoCD, TIFF, and  DPX.
       Use  ImageMagick  to translate, flip, mirror, rotate, scale, shear and transform images, adjust image colors,
       apply various special effects, or draw text, lines, polygons, ellipses and B\['e]zier curves.

       ImageMagick is free software delivered as a ready-to-run binary distribution or as source code that  you  can
       freely  use, copy, modify, and distribute. Its license is compatible with the GPL. It runs on all major oper‐
       ating systems.

       The functionality of ImageMagick is typically utilized from the command line or you can use the features from
       programs written in your favorite programming language. Choose from these interfaces: MagickCore (C), Magick‐
       Wand (C), ChMagick (Ch), Magick++ (C++), JMagick (Java), L-Magick (Lisp), PascalMagick  (Pascal),  PerlMagick
       (Perl),  MagickWand  for PHP (PHP), PythonMagick (Python), RMagick (Ruby), or TclMagick (Tcl/TK). With a lan‐
       guage interface, use ImageMagick to modify or create images automagically and dynamically.

       ImageMagick includes a number of command-line utilities for manipulating images. Most  of  you  are  probably
       accustom  to editing images one at a time with a graphical user interface (GUI) with such programs as gimp or
       Photoshop. However, a GUI is not always convenient. Suppose you want to process an image dynamically  from  a
       web  script or you want to apply the same operations to many images or repeat a specific operation at differ‐
       ent times to the same or different image. For these types of operations, the  command-line  image  processing
       utility is appropriate.

       In  the  paragraphs  below, find a short description for each command-line tool.Cl ick on the program name to
       get details on the program usage and a list of comman d-line options that alters how the program performs. If
       you are just getting acq uainted with ImageMagick, start at the top of the list, the convert program, and
        work your way down. Also be sure to peruse Anthony Thyssen's tutorial on how to
        use ImageMagick utilities to convert, compose, or edit images from the command- line.

       convert

              convert  between  image  formats  as  well as resize an image, blur, crop, despeckle, dither, draw on,
              flip, join, re-sample, and much more.

       identify

              describes the format and characteristics of one or more image files.

       mogrify

              resize an image, blur, crop, despeckle, dither, draw on, flip, join, re-sample, and much more. Mogrify
              overwrites the original image file, whereas, convert writes to a different image file.

       composite

              overlaps one image over another.

       montage

              create  a  composite image by combining several separate images. The images are tiled on the composite
              image optionally adorned with a border, frame, image name, and more.

       compare

              mathematically and visually annotate the difference between an image and its reconstruction..


       stream

              is a lightweight tool to stream one or more pixel components of the image or portion of the  image  to
              your choice of storage formats. It writes the pixel components as they are read from the input image a
              row at a time making stream desirable when working with large images or when  you  require  raw  pixel
              components.


       display

              displays an image or image sequence on any X server.

       animate

              animates an image sequence on any X server.

       import

              saves any visible window on an X server and outputs it as an image file. You can capture a single win‐
              dow, the entire screen, or any rectangular portion of the screen.

       conjure

              interprets and executes scripts written in the Magick Scripting Language (MSL).
