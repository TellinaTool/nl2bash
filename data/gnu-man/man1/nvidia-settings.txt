DESCRIPTION
       The nvidia-settings utility is a tool for configuring the NVIDIA graphics driver.  It operates by communicat‐
       ing with the NVIDIA X driver, querying and updating state as appropriate.  This communication is done via the
       NV-CONTROL, GLX, XVideo, and RandR X extensions.

       Values  such  as brightness and gamma, XVideo attributes, temperature, and OpenGL settings can be queried and
       configured via nvidia-settings.

       When nvidia-settings starts, it reads the current settings from its configuration file and sends  those  set‐
       tings  to  the X server.  Then, it displays a graphical user interface (GUI) for configuring the current set‐
       tings.  When nvidia-settings exits, it queries the current settings from the X server and saves them  to  the
       configuration file.

OPTIONS
       -v, --version
              Print the nvidia-settings version and exit.

       -h, --help
              Print usage information and exit.

       --config=CONFIG
              Use the configuration file CONFIG rather than the default ~/.nvidia-settings-rc


       -c CTRL-DISPLAY, --ctrl-display=CTRL-DISPLAY
              Control  the  specified X display.  If this option is not given, then nvidia-settings will control the
              display specified by '--display' ; if that is not given, then the  $DISPLAY  environment  variable  is
              used.

       -l, --load-config-only
              Load  the  configuration file, send the values specified therein to the X server, and exit.  This mode
              of operation is useful to place in your xinitrc file, for example.

       -n, --no-config
              Do not load the configuration file.  This mode of operation is useful if nvidia-settings has difficul‐
              ties starting due to problems with applying settings in the configuration file.

       -r, --rewrite-config-file
              Write  the  X server configuration to the configuration file, and exit, without starting the graphical
              user interface.  See EXAMPLES section.

       -V VERBOSE, --verbose=VERBOSE
              Controls how much information is printed.  Valid values are 'none' (do  not  print  status  messages),
              'errors'  (print  error  messages),  'deprecations' (print error and deprecation messages), 'warnings'
              (print error, deprecation, and warning messages), and 'all' (print  error,  deprecation,  warning  and
              other informational messages).  By default, 'deprecations' is set.

       -a ASSIGN, --assign=ASSIGN
              The ASSIGN argument to the '--assign' command line option is of the form:

                {DISPLAY}/{attribute name}[{display devices}]={value}

              This  assigns  the  attribute {attribute name} to the value {value} on the X Display {DISPLAY}.  {DIS‐
              PLAY} follows the usual {host}:{display}.{screen} syntax of the DISPLAY environment  variable  and  is
              optional;  when  it is not specified, then it is implied following the same rule as the --ctrl-display
              option.  If the X screen is not specified, then the assignment is made to all X  screens.   Note  that
              the '/' is only required when {DISPLAY} is present.

              {DISPLAY}  can  additionally include a target specification to direct an assignment to something other
              than an X screen.  A target specification is contained within brackets and consists of a  target  type
              name, a colon, and the target id.  The target type name can be one of screen , gpu , framelock , vcs ,
              gvi , fan , thermalsensor , svp , or dpy ; the target id is the index into the list  of  targets  (for
              that  target  type).   The  target  specification can be used in {DISPLAY} wherever an X screen can be
              used, following the syntax {host}:{display}[{target_type}:{target_id}].  See the output of

                nvidia-settings -q all

              for information on which target types can be used with which attributes.  See the output of

                 nvidia-settings -q screens -q gpus -q framelocks -q vcs -q gvis -q fans -q thermalsensors  -q  svps
              -q dpys

              for lists of targets for each target type.

              The  [{display  devices}]  portion  is  also  optional;  if it is not specified, then the attribute is
              assigned to all display devices.

              Some examples:

                -a FSAA=5
                -a localhost:0.0/DigitalVibrance[CRT-0]=0
                --assign="SyncToVBlank=1"
                -a [gpu:0]/DigitalVibrance[DFP-1]=63


       -q QUERY, --query=QUERY
              The QUERY argument to the '--query' command line option is of the form:

                {DISPLAY}/{attribute name}[{display devices}]

              This queries the current value of the attribute {attribute name} on the X Display {DISPLAY}.  The syn‐
              tax  is  the  same  as that for the '--assign' option, without '= {value}' ; specify '-q screens', '-q
              gpus', '-q framelocks', '-q vcs', '-q gvis', '-q fans' , '-q thermalsensors', '-q svps', or '-q  dpys'
              to  query  a list of X screens, GPUs, Frame Lock devices, Visual Computing Systems, SDI Input Devices,
              Fans, Thermal Sensors, 3D Vision Pro Transceivers, or Display Devices, respectively, that are  present
              on the X Display {DISPLAY}.  Specify '-q all' to query all attributes.

       -t, --terse
              When  querying  attribute values with the '--query' command line option, only print the current value,
              rather than the more verbose description of the attribute, its valid values, and its current value.

       -d, --display-device-string
              When printing attribute values in response to the '--query' option, if the attribute value is  a  dis‐
              play  device  mask, print the value as a list of display devices (e.g., "CRT-0, DFP-0"), rather than a
              hexadecimal bit mask (e.g., 0x00010001).

       -g, --glxinfo
              Print GLX Information for the X display and exit.

       -e DESCRIBE, --describe=DESCRIBE
              Prints information about a particular attribute.  Specify  'all'  to  list  the  descriptions  of  all
              attributes.  Specify 'list' to list the attribute names without a descriptions.

       -p PAGE, --page=PAGE
              The  PAGE argument to the '--page' commandline option selects a particular page in the nvidia-settings
              user interface to display upon starting nvidia-settings.  Valid values are the page names in the  tree
              view on the left side of the nvidia-settings user interface; e.g.,

                --page="X Screen 0"

              Because some page names are not unique (e.g., a "PowerMizer" page is present under each GPU), the page
              name can optionally be prepended with the name of the parent X Screen  or  GPU  page,  followed  by  a
              comma.  E.g.,

                --page="GPU 0 - (Quadro 6000), PowerMizer"

              The  first page with a name matching the PAGE argument will be used.  By default, the "X Server Infor‐
              mation" page is displayed.

       -L, --list-targets-only
              When performing an attribute query (from the '--query' command line option) or an attribute assignment
              (from  the  '--assign' command line option or when loading an ~/.nvidia-settings-rc file), nvidia-set‐
              tings identifies one or more targets on which to query/assign the attribute.

              The '--list-targets-only' option  will  cause  nvidia-settings  to  list  the  targets  on  which  the
              query/assign  operation  would  have been performed, without actually performing the operation(s), and
              exit.

       -w, --write-config, --no-write-config
              Save the configuration file on exit (enabled by default).

       -i, --use-gtk2
              Force nvidia-settings to use the GTK+ 2 library for the graphical user interface if a  user  interface
              is  required.  This option is only available on systems where nvidia-settings supports both the GTK+ 2
              and GTK+ 3 user interfaces.


       -I GTK-LIBRARY, --gtk-library=GTK-LIBRARY
              Specify the graphical user interface library to use if a nvidia-settings user interface  is  required.
              This  value  may be the exact location of the library or it may be the directory containing the appro‐
              priately named library. If this is the exact location, the 'use-gtk2' option is ignored.

   1. Layout of the nvidia-settings GUI
       The nvidia-settings GUI is organized with a list of different categories on the left side.  Only one entry in
       the  list  can be selected at once, and the selected category controls which "page" is displayed on the right
       side of the nvidia-settings GUI.

       The category list is organized in a tree: each X screen contains the relevant subcategories beneath it.  Sim‐
       ilarly,  the  Display  Devices  category  for  a  screen contains all the enabled display devices beneath it.
       Besides each X screen, the other top level category  is  "nvidia-settings  Configuration",  which  configures
       behavior of the nvidia-settings application itself.

       Along the bottom of the nvidia-settings GUI, from left to right, is:

       1)     a status bar which indicates the most recently altered option;

       2)     a  Help  button that toggles the display of a help window which provides a detailed explanation of the
              available options in the current page; and

       3)     a Quit button to exit nvidia-settings.

       Most options throughout nvidia-settings are applied immediately.  Notable exceptions are OpenGL options which
       are only read by OpenGL when an OpenGL application starts.

       Details about the options on each page of nvidia-settings are available in the help window.

   2. How OpenGL Interacts with nvidia-settings
       When  an  OpenGL  application  starts,  it downloads the current values from the X driver, and then reads the
       environment (see APPENDIX E: OPENGL ENVIRONMENT VARIABLE SETTINGS in the README).  Settings from the X server
       override OpenGL's default values, and settings from the environment override values from the X server.

       For  example, by default OpenGL uses the FSAA setting requested by the application (normally, applications do
       not request any FSAA).  An FSAA setting specified in nvidia-settings would override the OpenGL  application's
       request.  Similarly, the __GL_FSAA_MODE environment variable will override the application's FSAA setting, as
       well as any FSAA setting specified in nvidia-settings.

       Note that an OpenGL application only retrieves settings from the X server when it starts, so if  you  make  a
       change  to  an  OpenGL  value in nvidia-settings, it will only apply to OpenGL applications which are started
       after that point in time.

   3. Loading Settings Automatically
       The NVIDIA X driver does not preserve values set with nvidia-settings between runs of the X server  (or  even
       between  logging in and logging out of X, with xdm(1), gdm, or kdm ).  This is intentional, because different
       users may have different preferences, thus these settings are stored on a per-user basis in  a  configuration
       file stored in the user's home directory.

       The  configuration  file is named ~/.nvidia-settings-rc.  You can specify a different configuration file name
       with the --config command line option.

       After you have run nvidia-settings once and have generated a configuration file, you can then run:

            nvidia-settings --load-config-only

       at any time in the future to upload these settings to the X server again.  For example, you might  place  the
       above command in your ~/.xinitrc file so that your settings are applied automatically when you log in to X.

       Your  .xinitrc  file,  which  controls what X applications should be started when you log into X (or startx),
       might look something like this:

            nvidia-settings --load-config-only &
            xterm &
            evilwm

       or:

            nvidia-settings --load-config-only &
            gnome-session

       If you do not already have an ~/.xinitrc file, then chances are that xinit(1) is using a system-wide  xinitrc
       file.  This system wide file is typically here:

            /etc/X11/xinit/xinitrc

       To  use  it, but also have nvidia-settings upload your settings, you could create an ~/.xinitrc with the con‐
       tents:

            nvidia-settings --load-config-only &
            . /etc/X11/xinit/xinitrc

       System administrators may choose to place the nvidia-settings load command directly  in  the  system  xinitrc
       script.

       Please see the xinit(1) man page for further details of configuring your ~/.xinitrc file.

   4. Command Line Interface
       nvidia-settings  has  a  rich command line interface: all attributes that can be manipulated with the GUI can
       also be queried and set from the command line.  The command line syntax for querying and assigning attributes
       matches that of the .nvidia-settings-rc configuration file.

       The  --query  option  can  be used to query the current value of attributes.  This will also report the valid
       values for the attribute.  You can  run  nvidia-settings  --query  all  for  a  complete  list  of  available
       attributes,  what  the  current  value  is, what values are valid for the attribute, and through which target
       types (e.g., X screens, GPUs) the attributes can be addressed.  Additionally, individual  attributes  may  be
       specified like this:

               nvidia-settings --query Overlay

       An  attribute name may be prepended with an X Display name and a forward slash to indicate a different X Dis‐
       play; e.g.:

               nvidia-settings --query localhost:0.0/Overlay

       An attribute name may also just be prepended with the screen number and a forward slash:

               nvidia-settings --query 0/Overlay

       in which case the default X Display will be used, but you can indicate to which X screen to direct the  query
       (if  your  X  server  has multiple X screens).  If no X screen is specified, then the attribute value will be
       queried for all valid targets of the attribute (eg GPUs, Displays X screens, etc).

       Attributes can be addressed through "target types".  A target type indicates the object that is queried  when
       you  query  an  attribute.  The default target type is an X screen, but other possible target types are GPUs,
       Frame Lock devices, Visual Computing Systems, SDI Input Devices, fans, thermal sensors, 3D Vision Pro  Trans‐
       ceivers and display devices.

       Target types give you different granularities with which to perform queries and assignments.  Since X screens
       can span multiple GPUs (in the case of Xinerama, or SLI), and multiple X screens can exist on the  same  GPU,
       it is sometimes useful to address attributes by GPU rather than X screen.

       A  target  specification is contained within brackets and may consist of a target type name, a colon, and the
       target id.  The target type name can be one of screen, gpu, framelock, vcs, gvi, fan, thermalsensor, svp,  or
       dpy;  the  target id is the index into the list of targets (for that target type).  Target specifications can
       be used wherever an X screen is used in query and assignment commands; the target specification can  be  used
       either by itself on the left side of the forward slash, or as part of an X Display name.

       For example, the following queries address X screen 0 on the localhost:

               nvidia-settings --query 0/VideoRam
               nvidia-settings --query localhost:0.0/VideoRam
               nvidia-settings --query [screen:0]/VideoRam
               nvidia-settings --query localhost:0[screen:0]/VideoRam

       To address GPU 0 instead, you can use either of:

               nvidia-settings --query [gpu:0]/VideoRam
               nvidia-settings --query localhost:0[gpu:0]/VideoRam

       Note  that  if a target specification is present, it will override any X screen specified in the display name
       as the target to process.  For example, the following query would address GPU 0, and not X screen 1:

            nvidia-settings --query localhost:0.1[gpu:0]/VideoRam


       A target name may be used instead of a target id, in which case all targets  with  matching  names  are  pro‐
       cessed.

       For example, querying the DigitalVibrance of display device DVI-I-1 may be done like so:

            nvidia-settings --query [dpy:DVI-I-1]/DigitalVibrance

       When a target name is specified, the target type name may be omitted, though this should be used with caution
       since the name will be matched across all target types.  The above example could be written as:

            nvidia-settings --query [DVI-I-1]/DigitalVibrance

       The target name may also simply be a target type name, in which  case  all  targets  of  that  type  will  be
       queried.

       For exmple, querying the BusRate of all GPUs may be done like so:

            nvidia-settings --query [gpu]/BusRate


       The target specification may also include a target qualifier.  This is useful to limit processing to a subset
       of targets, based on an existing relationship(s) to other targets.  The  target  qualifier  is  specified  by
       prepending  a target type name, a colon, the target id, and a period to the existing specification.  Only one
       qualitfer may be specified.

       For example, querying the RefreshRate of all DFP devices on GPU 1 may be done like so:

            nvidia-settings --query [GPU:1.DPY:DFP]/RefreshRate

       Likewise, a simple target name (or target type name) may be used as the qualifier.  For example, to query the
       BusType of all GPUs that have DFPs can be done like so:

            nvidia-settings --query [DFP.GPU]/BusType


       See the output of

               nvidia-settings --query all

       for what targets types can be used with each attribute.  See the output of

               nvidia-settings --query screens --query gpus --query framelocks --query vcs --query gvis --query fans --query thermalsensors --query svps --query dpys

       for lists of targets for each target type.

       To  enable support for the "GPUGraphicsClockOffset" and "GPUMemoryTransferRateOffset" attributes, ensure that
       the "Coolbits" X configuration option includes the value "8" in the bitmask.  For more details, refer to  the
       documentation  of  the  "Coolbits"  option  in  the  NVIDIA  driver  README.  Query the "GPUPerfModes" string
       attribute to see a list of the available performance modes:

            nvidia-settings --query GPUPerfModes


       Each performance mode is presented as a comma-separated list of "token=value" pairs.  Each set of performance
       mode tokens is separated by a ";".  The "perf" token indicates the performance level.  The "*editable" tokens
       indicate which domains within the performance level can have an offset applied.  The "GPUGraphicsClockOffset"
       and  "GPUMemoryTransferRateOffset"  attributes map respectively to the "nvclock" and "memtransferrate" tokens
       of performance levels in the "GPUPerfModes" string.

       Note that the clock manipulation attributes "GPUGraphicsClockOffset" and "GPUMemoryTransferRateOffset"  apply
       to  the  offsets of specific performance levels.  The performance level is specified in square brackets after
       the attribute name.  For example, to query the "GPUGraphicsClockOffset" for performance level 2:

            nvidia-settings --query GPUGraphicsClockOffset[2]

       The --assign option can be used to assign a new value to an attribute.  The valid values for an attribute are
       reported  when the attribute is queried.  The syntax for --assign is the same as --query, with the additional
       requirement that assignments also have an equal sign and the new value.  For example:

               nvidia-settings --assign FSAA=2
               nvidia-settings --assign [CRT-1]/DigitalVibrance=9
               nvidia-settings --assign [gpu:0]/DigitalVibrance=0
               nvidia-settings --assign [gpu:0]/GPUGraphicsClockOffset[2]=10

       Multiple queries and assignments may be specified on the command line for a single invocation of  nvidia-set‐
       tings.  Assignments are processed in the order they are entered on the command line.  If multiple assignments
       are made to the same attribute or to multiple attributes with dependencies, then the later  assignments  will
       have priority.

       If  either  the --query or --assign options are passed to nvidia-settings, the GUI will not be presented, and
       nvidia-settings will exit after processing the assignments and/or queries.  In this case, settings  contained
       within  the  ~/.nvidia-settings-rc configuration file will not be automatically uploaded to the X server, nor
       will the ~/.nvidia-settings-rc configuration file be automatically updated to reflect  attribute  assignments
       made via the --assign option.

   5. X Display Names in the Config File
       In  the  Command  Line  Interface section above, it was noted that you can specify an attribute without any X
       Display qualifiers, with only an X screen qualifier, or with a full X Display name.  For example:

               nvidia-settings --query FSAA
               nvidia-settings --query 0/FSAA
               nvidia-settings --query stravinsky.nvidia.com:0/FSAA

       In the first two cases, the default X Display will be used, in the second case, the screen from the default X
       Display can be overridden, and in the third case, the entire default X Display can be overridden.

       The same possibilities are available in the ~/.nvidia-settings-rc configuration file.

       For  example,  in  a computer lab environment, you might log into any of multiple workstations, and your home
       directory is NFS mounted to each workstation.  In such a situation, you might want your ~/.nvidia-settings-rc
       file  to  be  applicable  to all the workstations.  Therefore, you would not want your config file to qualify
       each attribute with an X Display Name.  Leave the "Include  X  Display  Names  in  the  Config  File"  option
       unchecked on the nvidia-settings Configuration page (this is the default).

       There  may  be  cases when you do want attributes in the config file to be qualified with the X Display name.
       If you know what you are doing and want config file attributes to be qualified with an X Display,  check  the
       "Include X Display Names in the Config File" option on the nvidia-settings Configuration page.

       In the typical home user environment where your home directory is local to one computer and you are only con‐
       figuring one X Display, then it does not matter whether each attribute setting is qualified with an X Display
       Name.

   6. Connecting to Remote X Servers
       nvidia-settings  is  an X client, but uses two separate X connections: one to display the GUI, and another to
       communicate the NV-CONTROL requests.  These two X connections do not need to be to the same  X  server.   For
       example,  you might run nvidia-settings on the computer stravinsky.nvidia.com, export the display to the com‐
       puter bartok.nvidia.com, but be configuring the X server on the computer schoenberg.nvidia.com:

               nvidia-settings --display=bartok.nvidia.com:0 \
                   --ctrl-display=schoenberg.nvidia.com:0

       If --ctrl-display is not specified, then the X Display to control is what --display indicates.  If  --display
       is also not specified, then the $DISPLAY environment variable is used.

       Note,  however,  that you will need to have X permissions configured such that you can establish an X connec‐
       tion from the computer on which you are running nvidia-settings (stravinsky.nvidia.com) to the computer where
       you  are displaying the GUI (bartok.nvidia.com) and the computer whose X Display you are configuring (schoen‐
       berg.nvidia.com).

       The simplest, most common, and least secure mechanism to do this is to use 'xhost' to allow access  from  the
       computer on which you are running nvidia-settings.

               (issued from bartok.nvidia.com)
               xhost +stravinsky.nvidia.com

               (issued from schoenberg.nvidia.com)
               xhost +stravinsky.nvidia.com

       This  will  allow  all X clients run on stravinsky.nvidia.com to connect and display on bartok.nvidia.com's X
       server and configure schoenberg.nvidia.com's X server.

       Please see the xauth(1) and xhost(1) man pages, or refer to your system documentation on  remote  X  applica‐
       tions  and  security.  You might also Google for terms such as "remote X security" or "remote X Windows", and
       see documents such as the Remote X Apps mini-HOWTO:

            ⟨http://www.tldp.org/HOWTO/Remote-X-Apps.html⟩

       Please also note that the remote X server to be controlled must be using the NVIDIA X driver.

   7. Licensing
       The source code to nvidia-settings is released as GPL.  The most recent official version of the  source  code
       is available here:

            ⟨ftp://download.nvidia.com/XFree86/nvidia-settings/⟩

       Note  that nvidia-settings is simply an NV-CONTROL client.  It uses the NV-CONTROL X extension to communicate
       with the NVIDIA X server to query current settings and make changes to settings.

       You can make additions directly to nvidia-settings, or write your own NV-CONTROL  client,  using  nvidia-set‐
       tings as an example.

       Documentation  on the NV-CONTROL extension and additional sample clients are available in the nvidia-settings
       source tarball.  Patches can be submitted to linux-bugs@nvidia.com.

   8. TODO
       There are many things still to be added to nvidia-settings, some of which include:

       -      different toolkits?   The  GUI  for  nvidia-settings  is  cleanly  abstracted  from  the  back-end  of
              nvidia-settings  that  parses the configuration file and command line, communicates with the X server,
              etc.  If someone were so inclined, a different front-end GUI could be implemented.

       -      write a design document explaining how nvidia-settings is designed; presumably this would make it eas‐
              ier for people to become familiar with the code base.

       If  there  are  other  things you would like to see added (or better yet, would like to add yourself), please
       contact linux-bugs@nvidia.com.
