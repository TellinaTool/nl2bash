MOUNTPOINT(1)                            Linux System Administrator's Manual                           MOUNTPOINT(1)



NAME
       mountpoint - see if a directory is a mountpoint

SYNOPSIS
       /bin/mountpoint [-q] [-d] /path/to/directory
       /bin/mountpoint -x /dev/device

DESCRIPTION
       Mountpoint checks if the directory is a mountpoint.


OPTIONS
       -q     Be quiet - don't print anything.

       -d     Print major/minor device number of the filesystem on stdout.

       -x     Print major/minor device number of the blockdevice on stdout.

EXIT STATUS
       Zero if the directory is a mountpoint, non-zero if not.

NOTES
       Symbolic links are not followed, except when the -x option is used. To force following symlinks, add a trail‐
       ing slash to the path of the directory.

       The name of the command is misleading when the -x option is used, but the option is useful for comparing if a
       directory and a device match up, and there is no other command that can print the info easily.
