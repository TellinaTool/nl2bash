NAME
       Boost.Build - software build tool

DESCRIPTION
       Boost.Build 2011.12-svn

       Project-specific help:

              Project has jamfile at Jamroot

       Usage:

              b2 [options] [properties] [install|stage]

              Builds and installs Boost.

       Targets and Related Options:

       install
              Install headers and compiled library files to the

       =======
              configured locations (below).

       --prefix=<PREFIX>
              Install  architecture independent files here.  Default; C:\Boost on Win32 Default; /usr/local on Unix.
              Linux, etc.

       --exec-prefix=<EPREFIX> Install architecture dependent files here.
              Default; <PREFIX>

       --libdir=<DIR>
              Install library files here.  Default; <EPREFIX>/lib

       --includedir=<HDRDIR>
              Install header files here.  Default; <PREFIX>/include

       stage  Build and install only compiled library files to the

       =====  stage directory.

       --stagedir=<STAGEDIR>
              Install library files here Default; ./stage

       Other Options:

       --build-type=<type>
              Build the specified pre-defined set of variations of the libraries.  Note,  that  which  variants  get
              built depends on what each library supports.

              --  minimal  -- (default) Builds a minimal set of variants. On Windows, these are static multithreaded
              libraries in debug and release modes, using shared runtime. On Linux, these are static and shared mul‐
              tithreaded libraries in release mode.

              -- complete -- Build all possible variations.

       --build-dir=DIR
              Build in this location instead of building within the distribution tree. Recommended!

       --show-libraries
              Display the list of Boost libraries that require build and installation steps, and then exit.

       --layout=<layout>
              Determine whether to choose library names and header locations such that multiple versions of Boost or
              multiple compilers can be used on the same system.

              -- versioned -- Names of boost binaries include the Boost version number, name and version of the com‐
              piler  and  encoded  build properties. Boost headers are installed in a subdirectory of <HDRDIR> whose
              name contains the Boost version number.

              -- tagged -- Names of boost binaries include the encoded build properties such as variant and  thread‐
              ing,  but  do  not including compiler name and version, or Boost version. This option is useful if you
              build several variants of Boost, using the same compiler.

              -- system -- Binaries names do not include the Boost version number or the name and version number  of
              the  compiler.  Boost headers are installed directly into <HDRDIR>. This option is intended for system
              integrators building distribution packages.

              The default value is 'versioned' on Windows, and 'system' on Unix.

       --buildid=ID
              Add the specified ID to the name of built libraries.  The default is to not add anything.

       --python-buildid=ID
              Add the specified ID to the name of built libraries that depend on Python. The default is to  not  add
              anything. This ID is added in addition to --buildid.

       --help This message.

       --with-<library>
              Build and install the specified <library>. If this option is used, only libraries specified using this
              option will be built.

       --without-<library>
              Do not build, stage, or install the specified <library>. By default, all libraries are built.

       Properties:

       toolset=toolset
              Indicate the toolset to build with.

       variant=debug|release
              Select the build variant

       link=static|shared
              Whether to build static or shared libraries

       threading=single|multi
              Whether to build single or multithreaded binaries

              runtime-link=static|shared

              Whether to link to static or shared C and C++ runtime.

       Configuration help:

              Configuration file at /build/buildd/boost1.55-1.55.0/tools/build/v2/user-config.jam

              This file is used to configure your Boost.Build installation. You can modify

       this file in place, or you can place it in a permanent location so that it does not  get  overwritten  should
       you get a new version of Boost.Build. See:

              http://www.boost.org/boost-build2/doc/html/bbv2/overview/configuration.html

       for documentation about possible permanent locations.

       General command line usage:

              b2 [options] [properties] [targets]

              Options, properties and targets can be specified in any order.

       Important Options:

              *  --clean Remove targets instead of building * -a Rebuild everything * -n Don't execute the commands,
              only print them * -d+2 Show commands as they are executed * -d0 Supress all informational  messages  *
              -q Stop at first error * --reconfigure Rerun all configuration checks * --debug-configuration Diagnose
              configuration * --debug-building Report which targets are built with what properties * --debug-genera‐
              tor Diagnose generator search/execution

       Further Help:

              The following options can be used to obtain additional documentation.

              *  --help-options  Print more obscure command line options.  * --help-internal Boost.Build implementa‐
              tion details.  * --help-doc-options Implementation details doc formatting.
