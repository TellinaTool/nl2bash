PLAINBOX-TRUSTED-LAUNCHER-1(1)                        PlainBox                        PLAINBOX-TRUSTED-LAUNCHER-1(1)



NAME
       plainbox-trusted-launcher-1 - execute job command as another user

SYNOPSIS
       usage: plainbox-trusted-launcher-1 [-h] (-w | -t CHECKSUM)
              [-T NAME=VALUE [NAME=VALUE ...]]  [-g CHECKSUM] [-G NAME=VALUE [NAME=VALUE ...]]

DESCRIPTION
       This  command  is  a part of the implementation of plainbox(1). It is not intended to be invoked directly and
       the command line arguments and behavior may freely change between versions.

       Technically this program is used to run a command associated with a job definition as another user (typically
       as  root).  The  existing  technologies  such as sudo(8) and pkexec(1) don't have enough granularity to still
       restrict arbitrary commands but allow the commands that are inside system-wide installed locations (thus safe
       as  one  needs root access to install those in the first place). One additional restriction is that some com‐
       mands are themselves generated by other jobs.

EXECUTION
   Warm-up Mode
       If the --warmup option is specified then nothing more happens and the program  exists  immediately.  This  is
       intended to 'warm-up' the tool that executes plainbox-trusted-launcher-1 itself (typically pkexec or sudo)

   Normal Execution
       In  normal execution mode, the launcher looks up the job with the checksum specified by --target and executes
       the command embedded inside. Environment passed via --target-environment is appended to the environment vari‐
       ables inherited from the parent process.

       Standard  output,  standard  error and exit code of plainbox-trusted-launcher-1 is exactly as the values from
       the commands embedded into the selected job itself.

   Indirect Execution
       In indirect execution mode, the launcher first looks up the job with the checksum specified  by  --generator,
       executes it, discarding stderr and re-interpreting stdout as a set of job definitions. Environment passed via
       the --generator-environment is appended (but just to the generator job,  the  --target  job  has  independent
       environment).  All  of the additional job definitions are added to the global pool of jobs the launcher knows
       about.

       After that the launcher continues as with normal execution, returning the same stdout, stderr and exit code.

OPTIONS
   Optional Arguments
          -h, --help
                 show this help message and exit

          -w, --warmup
                 return immediately, only useful when used with pkexec(1)

   Target job specification
          -t CHECKSUM, --target CHECKSUM
                 run a job with this checksum

          -T NAME=VALUE [NAME=VALUE ...], --target-environment NAME=VALUE [NAME=VALUE ...]
                 environment passed to the target job

   Generator job specification
          -g CHECKSUM, --generator CHECKSUM
                 also run a job with this checksum (assuming it is a local job)

          -G NAME=VALUE [NAME=VALUE ...], --generator-environment NAME=VALUE [NAME=VALUE ...]
                 environment passed to the generator job

ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES
       The following environment variables DO NOT affect plainbox-trusted-launcher-1

       PROVIDERPATH
              For plainbox(1) this would affect the set of directories where plainbox  looks  for  provider  defini‐
              tions. The trusted launcher has a fixed list of directories that cannot be extended.

              The fixed list is composed of two system-wide locations:

              · /usr/local/share/plainbox-providers-1

              · /usr/share/plainbox-providers-1

       All the other environment variables mentioned in plainbox(1) work the same way.
