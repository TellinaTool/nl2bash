NAME
       recountdiff - recompute patch counts and offsets

SYNOPSIS
       recountdiff [file...]

       recountdiff {[--help] | [--version]}

DESCRIPTION
       recountdiff recomputes the counts and offsets in unified context diffs. It does this in two passes: first the
       counts are corrected by inspection of the actual patch lines, and then the offsets are adjusted according to
       the computed counts.

       The corrected diff is sent to standard output.

OPTIONS
       --help
           Display a short usage message.

       --version
           Display the version number of recountdiff.

LIMITATIONS
       There are some things that cannot be dealt with. If you have removed the first context line in a hunk, for
       example, there is no way for recountdiff to know that. For more precise fixing up, use rediff(1), which uses
       the original and modified diffs.
