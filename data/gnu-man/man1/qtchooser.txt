NAME
       qtchooser - a wrapper used to select between Qt development binary versions

SYNOPSIS
       qtchooser -list-versions
       qtchooser -print-env [-qt=version]
       qtchooser -run-tool=tool [-qt=version] [program_arguments]
       <executable_name> [-qt=version] [program_arguments]

DESCRIPTION
       Qt  is  a cross-platform C++ application framework. Qt's primary feature is its rich set of widgets that pro‐
       vide standard GUI functionality.

       The Qt Chooser provides a wrapper to switch between versions of Qt development binaries  when  multiple  ver‐
       sions like 4 and 5 are installed or local Qt builds are to be used.

       It is commonly used via a symlink from an executable_name like qmake.

OPTIONS
       The options which apply to the qtchooser command are:

       -list-versions
           Lists available Qt versions from the configuration files

       -print-env
           Prints environment information

       -qt=version
           Selects version as the Qt version to be used

       -run-tool=tool
           Runs the selected tool.

ENVIRONMENT
       QT_SELECT
              Same  as  -qt=version.  If set, the selected configuration is used and binaries symlinked to qtchooser
              will be executed without additional parameters.

       XDG_CONFIG_HOME

       XDG_CONFIG_DIRS
              Used as specified in <http://standards.freedesktop.org/basedir-spec/basedir-spec-latest.html>

FILES
       /etc/xdg/qtchooser/*.conf
              System-wide configuration files. Each has two lines, the first is the path to  the  binaries  and  the
              second  is  the  path to the Qt libraries. If a default.conf is provided, the settings from it will be
              automatically used in case nothing else is selected.

       $HOME/.config/qtchooser/*.conf
              User configuration files.
