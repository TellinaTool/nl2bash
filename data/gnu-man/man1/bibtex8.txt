NAME
       bibtex8 - 8-bit Big BibTeX version 0.99c

SYNOPSIS
       bibtex8 [options] aux-file

DESCRIPTION
       8-bit BibTeX is an enhanced, portable C version of BibTeX 0.99.  It has been enhanced in these areas:

       - conversion to "big" (32-bit) capacity

       - capacity selectable at run time

       - flexible support for non-English languages using 8-bit character sets

       - well matched to LateX2e and its "inputenc" package

       Oren  Patashnik,  the  creator of BibTeX, is working on a new BibTeX 1.0 that will be a modern implementation
       supporting large capacities and non-English languages (see TUGboat, pages 269--274, volume 15, number 3, Sep‐
       tember  1994).   He is content for this version to be released, but hopes that people will eventually migrate
       to BibTeX 1.0 when it is released.  Its release date is uncertain at the moment.
