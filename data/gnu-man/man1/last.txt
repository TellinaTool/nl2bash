LAST,LASTB(1)                            Linux System Administrator's Manual                           LAST,LASTB(1)



NAME
       last, lastb - show listing of last logged in users

SYNOPSIS
       last [-R] [-num] [ -n num ] [-adFiowx] [ -f file ] [ -t YYYYMMDDHHMMSS ] [name...]  [tty...]
       lastb [-R] [-num] [ -n num ] [ -f file ] [-adFiowx] [name...]  [tty...]

DESCRIPTION
       Last searches back through the file /var/log/wtmp (or the file designated by the -f flag) and displays a list
       of all users logged in (and out) since that file was created.  Names of users and  tty's  can  be  given,  in
       which  case last will show only those entries matching the arguments.  Names of ttys can be abbreviated, thus
       last 0 is the same as last tty0.

       When last catches a SIGINT signal (generated by the interrupt key, usually control-C)  or  a  SIGQUIT  signal
       (generated  by  the quit key, usually control-\), last will show how far it has searched through the file; in
       the case of the SIGINT signal last will then terminate.

       The pseudo user reboot logs in each time the system is rebooted.  Thus last reboot will show  a  log  of  all
       reboots since the log file was created.

       Lastb  is  the  same as last, except that by default it shows a log of the file /var/log/btmp, which contains
       all the bad login attempts.

OPTIONS
       -f file
              Tells last to use a specific file instead of /var/log/wtmp.

       -num   This is a count telling last how many lines to show.

       -n num The same.

       -t YYYYMMDDHHMMSS
              Display the state of logins as of the specified time.  This is useful, e.g., to determine  easily  who
              was logged in at a particular time -- specify that time with -t and look for "still logged in".

       -R     Suppresses the display of the hostname field.

       -a     Display the hostname in the last column. Useful in combination with the next flag.

       -d     For  non-local  logins,  Linux  stores  not only the host name of the remote host but its IP number as
              well. This option translates the IP number back into a hostname.

       -F     Print full login and logout times and dates.

       -i     This option is like -d in that it displays the IP number of the remote host, but it  displays  the  IP
              number in numbers-and-dots notation.

       -o     Read an old-type wtmp file (written by linux-libc5 applications).

       -w     Display full user and domain names in the output.

       -x     Display the system shutdown entries and run level changes.

NOTES
       The  files  wtmp  and  btmp  might  not be found. The system only logs information in these files if they are
       present. This is a local configuration issue. If you want the files to be used, they can be  created  with  a
       simple touch(1) command (for example, touch /var/log/wtmp).

FILES
       /var/log/wtmp
       /var/log/btmp
