NAME
       erb - an embedded Ruby language interpreter

SYNOPSIS
       erb1.9.1 [switches] [inputfile]

DESCRIPTION
       erb  interprets  a  Ruby code embedded text file. For example, erb enables you to embed a Ruby code to a HTML
       file.  A Ruby block starts with `<%' and ends with `%>'. erb replaces the block with its output.  If `<%'  is
       followed  by  `=', eRuby replaces the block with a value of the block.  If `<%' is followed by `#', the block
       is ignored as a comment.
