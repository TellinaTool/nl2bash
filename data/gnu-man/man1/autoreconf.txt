NAME
       autoreconf - Update generated configuration files

SYNOPSIS
       autoreconf [OPTION]... [DIRECTORY]...

DESCRIPTION
       Run   `autoconf'   (and   `autoheader',  `aclocal',  `automake',  `autopoint'  (formerly  `gettextize'),  and
       `libtoolize' where appropriate) repeatedly to remake the GNU Build System files in specified DIRECTORIES  and
       their subdirectories (defaulting to `.').

       By  default,  it  only remakes those files that are older than their sources.  If you install new versions of
       the GNU Build System, you can make `autoreconf' remake all of the files by giving it the `--force' option.

   Operation modes:
       -h, --help
              print this help, then exit

       -V, --version
              print version number, then exit

       -v, --verbose
              verbosely report processing

       -d, --debug
              don't remove temporary files

       -f, --force
              consider all files obsolete

       -i, --install
              copy missing auxiliary files

       --no-recursive
              don't rebuild sub-packages

       -s, --symlink
              with -i, install symbolic links instead of copies

       -m, --make
              when applicable, re-run ./configure && make

       -W, --warnings=CATEGORY
              report the warnings falling in CATEGORY [syntax]

   Warning categories include:
       `cross'
              cross compilation issues

       `gnu'  GNU coding standards (default in gnu and gnits modes)

       `obsolete'
              obsolete features or constructions

       `override'
              user redefinitions of Automake rules or variables

       `portability'
              portability issues (default in gnu and gnits modes)

       `syntax'
              dubious syntactic constructs (default)

       `unsupported'
              unsupported or incomplete features (default)

       `all'  all the warnings

       `no-CATEGORY'
              turn off warnings in CATEGORY

       `none' turn off all the warnings

       `error'
              treat warnings as errors

       The environment variable `WARNINGS' is honored.  Some subtools might support other warning types, using `all'
       is encouraged.

   Library directories:
       -B, --prepend-include=DIR
              prepend directory DIR to search path

       -I, --include=DIR
              append directory DIR to search path

       The  environment  variables AUTOM4TE, AUTOCONF, AUTOHEADER, AUTOMAKE, ACLOCAL, AUTOPOINT, LIBTOOLIZE, M4, and
       MAKE are honored.
