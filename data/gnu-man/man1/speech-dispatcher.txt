NAME
       speech-dispatcher - server process managing speech requests in Speech Dispatcher

SYNOPSIS
       speech-dispatcher [-{d|s}] [-l {1|2|3|4|5}] [-c com_method] [-S socket_path] [-p port] | [-v] | [-h]

DESCRIPTION
       speech-dispatcher is a server process that is responsible for transforming requests for text-to-speech output
       into actual speech hearable in the speakers. It arbitrates concurrent speech requests based on message prior‐
       ities,  and abstracts different speech synthesizers. Client programs, like screen readers or navigation soft‐
       ware, send speech requests to speech-dispatcher using TCP protocol  (with  the  help  of  client  libraries).
       speech-dispatcher  is usually started automatically by client libraries (i.e. autospawn), so you only need to
       run it manually if testing/debugging, or when in other explicit need for a special setup.
