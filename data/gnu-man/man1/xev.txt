XEV(1)                                         General Commands Manual                                        XEV(1)



NAME
       xev - print contents of X events

SYNOPSIS
       xev  [-display  displayname] [-geometry geom] [-bw pixels] [-bs {NotUseful,WhenMapped,Always}] [-id windowid]
       [-root] [-s] [-name string] [-rv]

DESCRIPTION
       Xev creates a window and then asks the X server to send it events whenever anything  happens  to  the  window
       (such as it being moved, resized, typed in, clicked in, etc.).  You can also attach it to an existing window.
       It is useful for seeing what causes events to occur and to display the information that they contain;  it  is
       essentially a debugging and development tool, and should not be needed in normal usage.

OPTIONS
       -display display
               This option specifies the X server to contact.

       -geometry geom
               This option specifies the size and/or location of the window, if a window is to be created.

       -bw pixels
               This option specifies the border width for the window.

       -bs {NotUseful,WhenMapped,Always}
               This option specifies what kind of backing store to give the window.  The default is NotUseful. Back‐
               ing store refers to the the pixels saved off-screen when the X server maintains  the  contents  of  a
               window; NotUseful means that the xev process will redraw its contents itself, as necessary.

       -id windowid
               This  option  specifies  that the window with the given id should be monitored, instead of creating a
               new window.

       -root   This option specifies that the root window should be monitored, instead of creating a new window.

       -s      This option specifies that save-unders should be enabled on the window. Save unders  are  similar  to
               backing  store,  but  they  refer  rather  to the saving of pixels off-screen when the current window
               obscures other windows. Save unders are only advisory, and are normally set  for  popup  dialogs  and
               other transient windows.

       -name string
               This option specifies the name to assign to the created window.

       -rv     This option specifies that the window should be in reverse video.

       -event event_mask
               Select which events to display.  The -event option can be specified multiple times to select multiple
               types of events.  When not specified, all events are selected.  Available event masks: keyboard mouse
               expose visibility structure substructure focus property colormap owner_grab_button randr
