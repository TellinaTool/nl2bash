xpmtoppm(1)                                    General Commands Manual                                   xpmtoppm(1)



NAME
       xpmtoppm - convert an X11 pixmap into a portable pixmap


SYNOPSIS
       xpmtoppm [--alphaout={alpha-filename,-}] [-verbose] [xpmfile]


DESCRIPTION
       Reads an X11 pixmap (XPM version 1 or 3) as input.  Produces a PPM file as output.


OPTIONS
       --alphaout=alpha-filename
              xpmtoppm  creates  a  PBM  file  containing  the  transparency mask for the image.  If the input image
              doesn't contain transparency information, the alpha-filename file contains all  white  (opaque)  alpha
              values.   If  you don't specify --alphaout, xpmtoppm does not generate an alpha file, and if the input
              image has transparency information, xpmtoppm simply discards it.

              If you specify - as the filename, xpmtoppm writes the alpha output to Standard Output and discards the
              image.

              See pnmcomp(1) for one way to use the alpha output file.

       --verbose
              xpmtoppm prints information about its processing on Standard Error.


LIMITATIONS
       The  support to XPM version 3 is limited. Comments can only be single lines and there must be for every pixel
       a default colorname for a color type visual.
