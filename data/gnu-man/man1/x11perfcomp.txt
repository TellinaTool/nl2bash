NAME
       x11perfcomp - X11 server performance comparison program

SYNTAX
       x11perfcomp [ -r | -ro ] [ -l label_file ] files

DESCRIPTION
       The  x11perfcomp  program  merges the output of several x11perf(1) runs into a nice tabular format.  It takes
       the results in each file, fills in any missing test results  if  necessary,  and  for  each  test  shows  the
       objects/second rate of each server.  If invoked with the -r or -ro options, it shows the relative performance
       of each server to the first server.

       Normally, x11perfcomp uses the first file specified to determine which specific tests it  should  report  on.
       Some  (non-DEC :) servers may fail to perform all tests.  In this case, x11perfcomp automatically substitutes
       in a rate of 0.0 objects/second.  Since the first file determines which tests to report on,  this  file  must
       contain a superset of the tests reported in the other files, else x11perfcomp will fail.

       You  can  provide  an explicit list of tests to report on by using the -l switch to specify a file of labels.
       You can create a label file by using the -label option in x11perf.

OPTIONS
       x11perfcomp accepts the options listed below:

       -r              Specifies that the output should also include relative server performance.

       -ro             Specifies that the output should include only relative server performance.

       -l label_file   Specifies a label file to use.

X DEFAULTS
       There are no X defaults used by this program.

       Joel McCormack just munged them together a bit.
