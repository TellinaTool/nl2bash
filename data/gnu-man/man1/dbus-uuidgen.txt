dbus-uuidgen(1)                                General Commands Manual                               dbus-uuidgen(1)



NAME
       dbus-uuidgen - Utility to generate UUIDs

SYNOPSIS
       dbus-uuidgen [--version] [--ensure[=FILENAME]] [--get[=FILENAME]]


DESCRIPTION
       The dbus-uuidgen command generates or reads a universally unique ID.


       Note  that  the  D-Bus  UUID has no relationship to RFC 4122 and does not generate UUIDs compatible with that
       spec. Many systems have a separate command for that (often called "uuidgen").


       See http://www.freedesktop.org/software/dbus/ for more information about D-Bus.


       The primary usage of dbus-uuidgen is to run in the post-install script of a D-Bus package like this:
         dbus-uuidgen --ensure


       This will ensure that /var/lib/dbus/machine-id exists and has the uuid in it.  It won't overwrite an existing
       uuid, since this id should remain fixed for a single machine until the next reboot at least.


       The important properties of the machine UUID are that 1) it remains unchanged until the next reboot and 2) it
       is different for any two running instances of the OS kernel. That is, if two processes  see  the  same  UUID,
       they  should  also  see  the same shared memory, UNIX domain sockets, local X displays, localhost.localdomain
       resolution, process IDs, and so forth.


       If you run dbus-uuidgen with no options it just prints a new uuid made up out of thin air.


       If you run it with --get, it prints the machine UUID by default, or the UUID in the  specified  file  if  you
       specify a file.


       If  you  try to change an existing machine-id on a running system, it will probably result in bad things hap‐
       pening. Don't try to change this file. Also, don't make it the same on two different systems; it needs to  be
       different anytime there are two different kernels running.


       The UUID should be different on two different virtual machines, because there are two different kernels.


OPTIONS
       The following options are supported:

       --get[=FILENAME]
              If  a  filename  is not given, defaults to localstatedir/lib/dbus/machine-id (localstatedir is usually
              /var). If this file exists and is valid, the uuid in the file is printed  on  stdout.  Otherwise,  the
              command exits with a nonzero status.


       --ensure[=FILENAME]
              If  a  filename  is not given, defaults to localstatedir/lib/dbus/machine-id (localstatedir is usually
              /var). If this file exists then it will be validated, and a failure code returned if it  contains  the
              wrong  thing.   If  the  file  does  not exist, it will be created with a new uuid in it.  On success,
              prints no output.


       --version
              Print the version of dbus-uuidgen
