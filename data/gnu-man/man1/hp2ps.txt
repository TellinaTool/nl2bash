NAME
       hp2ps - convert a heap profile to a POSTSCRIPT graph

SYNOPSIS
       hp2ps [flags] [file][.hp]

DESCRIPTION
       The  program  hp2ps  converts  a  heap  profile stored in file into a POSTSCRIPT graph, sending the result to
       file.ps.  By convention, files to be processed by hp2ps have a .hp extension. However, for compatibility with
       older versions of hp2ps, this extension can be omitted. If file is omitted entirely, then the program behaves
       as a filter.

OPTIONS
       The flags are:

       -d     In order to make graphs more readable, hp2ps sorts the shaded bands for each identifier.  The  default
              sort ordering is for the bands with the largest area to be stacked on top of the smaller ones.  The -d
              option causes rougher bands (those reprsenting series of values with the largest standard  deviations)
              to be stacked on top of smoother ones.

       -b     Normally, hp2ps puts the title of the graph in a small box at the top of the page. However, if the JOB
              string is too long to fit in a small box (more than 35 characters), then hp2ps will choose  to  use  a
              big box instead. The -b option forces hp2ps to use a big box.

       -e float[in|mm|pt]
              Generate  encapsulated  POSTSCRIPT suitable for inclusion in LaTeX documents.  Usually, the POSTSCRIPT
              graph is drawn in landscape mode in an area 9 inches wide by 6 inches high,  and  hp2ps  arranges  for
              this  area  to be approximately centered on a sheet of a4 paper. This format is convenient of studying
              the graph in detail, but it is unsuitable for inclusion in LaTeX documents. The -e option  causes  the
              graph  to  be drawn in portrait mode, with float specifying the width in inches, millimetres or points
              (the default).  The resulting POSTSCRIPT file conforms to the Encapsulated Post Script  (EPS)  conven‐
              tion,  and  it  can be included in a LaTeX document using Rokicki's dvi-to-POSTSCRIPT converter dvips.
              hp2ps requires the width to exceed 2 inches.

       -g     Create output suitable for the gs POSTSCRIPT previewer (or similar). In this case the graph is printed
              in portrait mode without scaling. The output is unsuitable for a laser printer.

       -p     Use  previous  parameters.  By default, the POSTSCRIPT graph is automatically scaled both horizontally
              and vertically so that it fills the page.  However, when preparing a seires of graphs  for  use  in  a
              presentation,  it  is often useful to draw a new graph using the same scale, shading and ordering as a
              previous one. The -p flag causes the graph to be drawn using the parameters determined by  a  previous
              run of hp2ps on file.

       -s     Use a small box for the title.

       -y     Draw the graph in the traditional York style, ignoring marks.

       -?     Print out usage information.

INPUT FORMAT
       The format of a heap profile is best described by example:

              JOB "a.out -p"
              DATE "Fri Apr 17 11:43:45 1992"
              SAMPLE_UNIT "seconds"
              VALUE_UNIT "bytes"
              BEGIN_SAMPLE 0.00
                SYSTEM 24
              END_SAMPLE 0.00
              BEGIN_SAMPLE 1.00
                elim 180
                insert 24
                intersect 12
                disin 60
                main 12
                reduce 20
                SYSTEM 12
              END_SAMPLE 1.00
              MARK 1.50
              MARK 1.75
              MARK 1.80
              BEGIN_SAMPLE 2.00
                elim 192
                insert 24
                intersect 12
                disin 84
                main 12
                SYSTEM 24
              END_SAMPLE 2.00
              BEGIN_SAMPLE 2.82
              END_SAMPLE 2.82
