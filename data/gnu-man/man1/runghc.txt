RUNGHC(1)                                      General Commands Manual                                     RUNGHC(1)



NAME
       runghc - program to run Haskell programs without first having to compile them.

SYNOPSIS
       runghc [runghc|flags] [GHC|flags] module [program|flags]...

DESCRIPTION
       runghc  is  considered  a  non-interactive interpreter and part of The Glasgow Haskell Compiler.  runghc is a
       compiler that automatically runs its results at the end.

OPTIONS
       the flags are:

       -f     it tells runghc which GHC to use to run the program. If it is not given then runghc  will  search  for
              GHC in the directories in the system search path. runghc -f /path/to/ghc

       --     runghc  will  try  to  work  out where the boundaries between [runghc flags] and [GHC flags], and [GHC
              flags] and module are, but you can use a -- flag if it doesn't get it right. For  example,  runghc  --
              -fglasgow-exts  Foo  means  runghc  won't try to use glasgow-exts as the path to GHC, but instead will
              pass the flag to GHC.


EXAMPLES
       runghc foo

       runghc -f /path/to/ghc foo

       runghc -- -fglasgow-exts Foo
