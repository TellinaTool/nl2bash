NAME
       lppasswd - add, change, or delete digest passwords.

SYNOPSIS
       lppasswd [ username ]
       lppasswd -a [ -g groupname ] username
       lppasswd -x username

DESCRIPTION
       lppasswd adds, changes, or deletes passwords in the CUPS digest password file, passwd.md5. When run by a nor‐
       mal user, lppasswd will prompt for the old and new passwords.  When run by the super-user, lppasswd  can  add
       new  accounts  (-a  username),  change  existing accounts (username), or delete accounts (-x username) in the
       digest password file. Digest usernames do not have to match local UNIX usernames.

OPTIONS
       lppasswd supports the following options:

       -g groupname
            Specifies a group other than the default system group.

SECURITY ISSUES
       By default, the lppasswd program is not installed to allow ordinary  users  to  change  their  passwords.  To
       enable this, the lppasswd command must be made setuid to root with the command:
       chmod u+s lppasswd

       While every attempt has been made to make lppasswd secure against exploits that could grant super-user privi‐
       leges to unprivileged users, paranoid system  administrators  may  wish  to  use  Basic  authentication  with
       accounts managed by PAM instead.
