NAME
       psnup - multiple pages per sheet

SYNOPSIS
       psnup [ -wwidth ] [ -hheight ] [ -ppaper ] [ -Wwidth ] [ -Hheight ] [ -Ppaper ] [ -l ] [ -r ] [ -f ] [ -c ] [
       -mmargin ] [ -bborder ] [ -dlwidth ] [ -sscale ] [ -nup ] [ -q ] [ infile [ outfile ] ]

DESCRIPTION
       Psnup puts multiple logical pages onto each physical sheet of paper.  The input PostScript file should follow
       the Adobe Document Structuring Conventions.

       The -w option gives the paper width, and the -h option gives the paper height, normally specified in cm or in
       to convert PostScript's points (1/72 of an inch) to centimeters or inches.  The -p option can be used  as  an
       alternative,  to  set the paper size to a0, a1, a2, a3, a4, a5, b5, letter, legal, tabloid, statement, execu‐
       tive, folio, quarto or 10x14.  The default paper size is normally a4, but on a Debian system,  /etc/papersize
       is  consulted.  The -W, -H, and -P options set the input paper size, if it is different from the output size.
       This makes it easy to impose pages of one size on a different size of paper.

       The -l option should be used for pages which are in landscape orientation (rotated 90 degrees anticlockwise).
       The  -r option should be used for pages which are in seascape orientation (rotated 90 degrees clockwise), and
       the -f option should be used for pages which have the width and height interchanged, but are not rotated.

       Psnup normally uses `row-major' layout, where adjacent pages are placed in rows across  the  paper.   The  -c
       option changes the order to `column-major', where successive pages are placed in columns down the paper.

       A  margin  to  leave  around the whole page can be specified with the -m option. This is useful for sheets of
       `thumbnail' pages, because the normal page margins are reduced by putting multiple pages on a single sheet.

       The -b option is used to specify an additional margin around each page on a sheet.

       The -d option draws a line around the border of each page, of the specified width.  If the  lwidth  parameter
       is  omitted, a default linewidth of 1 point is assumed. The linewidth is relative to the original page dimen‐
       sions, i.e. it is scaled down with the rest of the page.

       The scale chosen by psnup can be overridden with the -s option. This is  useful  to  merge  pages  which  are
       already reduced.

       The -nup option selects the number of logical pages to put on each sheet of paper. This can be any whole num‐
       ber; psnup tries to optimise the layout so that the minimum amount of space is wasted. If psnup cannot find a
       layout  within  its tolerance limit, it will abort with an error message. The alternative form i nup can also
       be used, for compatibility with other n-up programs.

       Psnup normally prints the page numbers of the pages re-arranged; the -q option suppresses this.

EXAMPLES
       The potential use of this utility is varied but one particular use is in  conjunction  with  psbook(1).   For
       example, using groff to create a PostScript document and lpr as the UNIX print spooler a typical command line
       might look like this:

       groff -Tps -ms file | psbook | psnup -2 | lpr

       Where file is a 4 page document this command will result in a two page document printing two  pages  of  file
       per  page and rearranges the page order to match the input pages 4 and 1 on the first output page and pages 2
       then 3 of the input document on the second output page.
