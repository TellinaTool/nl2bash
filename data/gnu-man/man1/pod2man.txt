DESCRIPTION
       pod2man is a front-end for Pod::Man, using it to generate *roff input from POD source.  The resulting *roff
       code is suitable for display on a terminal using nroff(1), normally via man(1), or printing using troff(1).

       input is the file to read for POD source (the POD can be embedded in code).  If input isn't given, it
       defaults to "STDIN".  output, if given, is the file to which to write the formatted output.  If output isn't
       given, the formatted output is written to "STDOUT".  Several POD files can be processed in the same pod2man
       invocation (saving module load and compile times) by providing multiple pairs of input and output files on
       the command line.

       --section, --release, --center, --date, and --official can be used to set the headers and footers to use; if
       not given, Pod::Man will assume various defaults.  See below or Pod::Man for details.

       pod2man assumes that your *roff formatters have a fixed-width font named "CW".  If yours is called something
       else (like "CR"), use --fixed to specify it.  This generally only matters for troff output for printing.
       Similarly, you can set the fonts used for bold, italic, and bold italic fixed-width output.

       Besides the obvious pod conversions, Pod::Man, and therefore pod2man also takes care of formatting func(),
       func(n), and simple variable references like $foo or @bar so you don't have to use code escapes for them;
       complex expressions like $fred{'stuff'} will still need to be escaped, though.  It also translates dashes
       that aren't used as hyphens into en dashes, makes long dashes--like this--into proper em dashes, fixes
       "paired quotes," and takes care of several other troff-specific tweaks.  See Pod::Man for complete
       information.

OPTIONS
       -c string, --center=string
           Sets the centered page header to string.  The default is "User Contributed Perl Documentation", but also
           see --official below.

       -d string, --date=string
           Set the left-hand footer string to this value.  By default, the modification date of the input file will
           be used, or the current date if input comes from "STDIN".

       -errors=style
           Set the error handling style.  "die" says to throw an exception on any POD formatting error.  "stderr"
           says to report errors on standard error, but not to throw an exception.  "pod" says to include a POD
           ERRORS section in the resulting documentation summarizing the errors.  "none" ignores POD errors
           entirely, as much as possible.

           The default is "die".

       --fixed=font
           The fixed-width font to use for verbatim text and code.  Defaults to "CW".  Some systems may want "CR"
           instead.  Only matters for troff(1) output.

       --fixedbold=font
           Bold version of the fixed-width font.  Defaults to "CB".  Only matters for troff(1) output.

       --fixeditalic=font
           Italic version of the fixed-width font (actually, something of a misnomer, since most fixed-width fonts
           only have an oblique version, not an italic version).  Defaults to "CI".  Only matters for troff(1)
           output.

       --fixedbolditalic=font
           Bold italic (probably actually oblique) version of the fixed-width font.  Pod::Man doesn't assume you
           have this, and defaults to "CB".  Some systems (such as Solaris) have this font available as "CX".  Only
           matters for troff(1) output.

       -h, --help
           Print out usage information.

       -l, --lax
           No longer used.  pod2man used to check its input for validity as a manual page, but this should now be
           done by podchecker(1) instead.  Accepted for backward compatibility; this option no longer does anything.

       -n name, --name=name
           Set the name of the manual page to name.  Without this option, the manual name is set to the uppercased
           base name of the file being converted unless the manual section is 3, in which case the path is parsed to
           see if it is a Perl module path.  If it is, a path like ".../lib/Pod/Man.pm" is converted into a name
           like "Pod::Man".  This option, if given, overrides any automatic determination of the name.

           Note that this option is probably not useful when converting multiple POD files at once.  The convention
           for Unix man pages for commands is for the man page title to be in all-uppercase even if the command
           isn't.

       --nourls
           Normally, L<> formatting codes with a URL but anchor text are formatted to show both the anchor text and
           the URL.  In other words:

               L<foo|http://example.com/>

           is formatted as:

               foo <http://example.com/>

           This flag, if given, suppresses the URL when anchor text is given, so this example would be formatted as
           just "foo".  This can produce less cluttered output in cases where the URLs are not particularly
           important.

       -o, --official
           Set the default header to indicate that this page is part of the standard Perl release, if --center is
           not also given.

       -q quotes, --quotes=quotes
           Sets the quote marks used to surround C<> text to quotes.  If quotes is a single character, it is used as
           both the left and right quote; if quotes is two characters, the first character is used as the left quote
           and the second as the right quoted; and if quotes is four characters, the first two are used as the left
           quote and the second two as the right quote.

           quotes may also be set to the special value "none", in which case no quote marks are added around C<>
           text (but the font is still changed for troff output).

       -r, --release
           Set the centered footer.  By default, this is the version of Perl you run pod2man under.  Note that some
           system an macro sets assume that the centered footer will be a modification date and will prepend
           something like "Last modified: "; if this is the case, you may want to set --release to the last modified
           date and --date to the version number.

       -s, --section
           Set the section for the ".TH" macro.  The standard section numbering convention is to use 1 for user
           commands, 2 for system calls, 3 for functions, 4 for devices, 5 for file formats, 6 for games, 7 for
           miscellaneous information, and 8 for administrator commands.  There is a lot of variation here, however;
           some systems (like Solaris) use 4 for file formats, 5 for miscellaneous information, and 7 for devices.
           Still others use 1m instead of 8, or some mix of both.  About the only section numbers that are reliably
           consistent are 1, 2, and 3.

           By default, section 1 will be used unless the file ends in ".pm", in which case section 3 will be
           selected.

       --stderr
           By default, pod2man dies if any errors are detected in the POD input.  If --stderr is given and no
           --errors flag is present, errors are sent to standard error, but pod2man does not abort.  This is
           equivalent to "--errors=stderr" and is supported for backward compatibility.

       -u, --utf8
           By default, pod2man produces the most conservative possible *roff output to try to ensure that it will
           work with as many different *roff implementations as possible.  Many *roff implementations cannot handle
           non-ASCII characters, so this means all non-ASCII characters are converted either to a *roff escape
           sequence that tries to create a properly accented character (at least for troff output) or to "X".

           This option says to instead output literal UTF-8 characters.  If your *roff implementation can handle it,
           this is the best output format to use and avoids corruption of documents containing non-ASCII characters.
           However, be warned that *roff source with literal UTF-8 characters is not supported by many
           implementations and may even result in segfaults and other bad behavior.

           Be aware that, when using this option, the input encoding of your POD source must be properly declared
           unless it is US-ASCII or Latin-1.  POD input without an "=encoding" command will be assumed to be in
           Latin-1, and if it's actually in UTF-8, the output will be double-encoded.  See perlpod(1) for more
           information on the "=encoding" command.

       -v, --verbose
           Print out the name of each output file as it is being generated.

EXIT STATUS
       As long as all documents processed result in some output, even if that output includes errata (a "POD ERRORS"
       section generated with "--errors=pod"), pod2man will exit with status 0.  If any of the documents being
       processed do not result in an output document, pod2man will exit with status 1.  If there are syntax errors
       in a POD document being processed and the error handling style is set to the default of "die", pod2man will
       abort immediately with exit status 255.

DIAGNOSTICS
       If pod2man fails with errors, see Pod::Man and Pod::Simple for information about what those errors might
       mean.

EXAMPLES
           pod2man program > program.1
           pod2man SomeModule.pm /usr/perl/man/man3/SomeModule.3
           pod2man --section=7 note.pod > note.7

       If you would like to print out a lot of man page continuously, you probably want to set the C and D registers
       to set contiguous page numbering and even/odd paging, at least on some versions of man(7).

           troff -man -rC1 -rD1 perl.1 perldata.1 perlsyn.1 ...

       To get index entries on "STDERR", turn on the F register, as in:

           troff -man -rF1 perl.1

       The indexing merely outputs messages via ".tm" for each major page, section, subsection, item, and any "X<>"
       directives.  See Pod::Man for more details.

BUGS
       Lots of this documentation is duplicated from Pod::Man.
