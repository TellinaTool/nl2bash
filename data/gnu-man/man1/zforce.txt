ZFORCE(1)                                      General Commands Manual                                     ZFORCE(1)



NAME
       zforce - force a '.gz' extension on all gzip files

SYNOPSIS
       zforce [ name ...  ]

DESCRIPTION
       zforce  forces a .gz extension on all gzip files so that gzip will not compress them twice.  This can be use‐
       ful for files with names truncated after a file transfer.  On systems with  a  14  char  limitation  on  file
       names, the original name is truncated to make room for the .gz suffix. For example, 12345678901234 is renamed
       to 12345678901.gz. A file name such as foo.tgz is left intact.
