DESCRIPTION
       This manual page documents ps2eps version 1.68.

       ps2eps  is  a tool (written in Perl) to produce Encapsulated PostScript Files (EPS/EPSF) from usual one-paged
       Postscript documents. It calculates correct Bounding Boxes for those EPS files and filters some special post‐
       script  command  sequences  that  can  produce  erroneous results on printers. EPS files are often needed for
       including (scalable) graphics of high quality into TeX/LaTeX (or even Word) documents.

       Without any argument, ps2eps reads from standard input and writes to standard output.  If filenames are given
       as  arguments they are processed one by one and output files are written to filenames with extension .eps. If
       input filenames have the extension .ps or .prn, this extension is replaced with .eps.   In  all  other  cases
       .eps  is appended to the input filename.  Please note that PostScript files for input should contain only one
       single page (you can possibly use the psselect from the psutils package to extract a single page from a docu‐
       ment that contains multiple pages).

       If  BoundingBox  in output seems to be wrong, please try options --size or --ignoreBB. See also section TROU‐
       BLESHOOTING.

OPTIONS
       ps2eps follows the usual GNU command line syntax, with long options starting with two dashes (`-').   A  sum‐
       mary of options is included below.

       -h, --help
              Show summary of options.

       -V, --version
              Show version of program.

       -f, --force
              Force  overwriting existing files. ps2eps will not overwrite files by default to avoid deleting origi‐
              nal EPS files accidently.

       -q, --quiet
              quiet operation (no output while processing files, except errors).

       -N, --noinsert
              do not insert any postscript code. Normally a few postscript instructions are added around the  origi‐
              nal postscript code by ps2eps which can be turned off by this option.

       -O, --preserveorientation
              do not filter %%Orientation: header comment.

       -n, --nofix
              do not try to fix postscript code by filtering some instructions.

       -P, --removepreview
              remove preview image (smaller file, but no preview anymore).

       -F, --fixps
              fix postscript code unconditionally. Otherwise, filtering is usually triggered by detection of certain
              drivers only.

       -c, --comments
              preserve document structure comments.

       -C, --clip
              insert postscript code for clipping. Unless --nohires is specified, the HiResBoundingBox (enlarged  by
              0.1 points) is used for clipping.

       -m, --mono
              use black/white bitmap as base for calculation (default: off).

       -s, --size=pagedim
              where  pagedim is a pre-defined standard page size (e.g., a4,a0,b0,letter,...) or explicitly specified
              in a format pagedim:=XxY[cm|in], where X and Y are numbers (floating points are accepted) followed  by
              units  centimeter  (cm)  or  inch (in), (default: cm).  Use --size=list to list pre-defined pagesizes.
              See also environment variable PS2EPS_SIZE.

       -t, --translate=x,y
              specify an x,y offset (may be negative) in postscript points (1/72 dpi) for drawing. This  option  may
              be  required  if your drawing has negative coordinates which usually lets ghostscript cut the negative
              part of your picture, because it starts to render at positive coordinates. The resulting  output  will
              also be shifted.

       -r, --resolution=dpi
              specify  a  resolution in dpi (dots per inch) for drawing under ghostscript. Default resolution is 144
              dpi which is the double of the typical 72 dpi.  This option may help if there is a hardware  dependent
              resolution encoded in the postscript, e.g., 600dpi. Example: ps2eps -l -r 600 test.ps

       -R, --rotate=direction
              This  option  rotates  the  resulting EPS output.  The parameter direction determines the direction of
              rotation: + means +90 degrees (clockwise),- means -90 degrees (counter-clockwise), and   ^  means  180
              degrees (up-side down).

       -l, --loose
              expand the original tight bounding box by one point in each direction.

       -B, --ignoreBB
              do not use existing bounding box as page size for rendering.

       -E, --ignoreEOF
              do  not  use  %%EOF as hint for end of file. Otherwise, ps2eps assumes that postscript code ends after
              the last %%EOF comment, because some drivers add trailing binary ``garbage'' code which  gets  deleted
              by ps2eps by default.

       -g, --gsbbox
              use  internal  bbox  device  of  ghostscript instead of the external C program bbox. The internal bbox
              device of ghostscript generates different values (sometimes even incorrect),  so  using  the  provided
              bbox should be more robust.  See also environment variable PS2EPS_GSBBOX.

       -H, --nohires
              do not generate a %%HiResBoundingBox comment for output.

       -a, --accuracy
              increase the accuracy by turning subsample antialiasing on (may be slower)

       -L, --license
              show licensing information.

       -d, --debuggs
              show ghostscript call. This may be helpful for solving problems that occur during a ghostscript call.

       -W, --warnings
              show  warnings about sanity of generated EPS file. Certain postscript commands should not be contained
              in an EPS file.  With this option set ps2eps will issue a warning if it detects at least one of them.

TROUBLESHOOTING
       Based on the given postscript source code (in most cases generated by some postscript printer  driver)  there
       are  many  potential obstacles or problems that may occur when trying to create proper EPS files. Please read
       this section carefully to be aware of common pitfalls.

   INCOMPLETE/CLIPPED IMAGES
       or how to determine the right size for ghostscript.

       If you have documents that are larger than your ghostscript default (usually A4 or US letter),  you  have  to
       specify  the  page dimensions explicitly using the -s option. Otherwise your EPS might be cut off during ras‐
       terizing by ghostscript resulting in a wrongly calculated bounding box. You can  pass  all  pre-defined  page
       sizes  to  -s  that  ghostscript understands. These are currently: 11x17, ledger, legal, letter, lettersmall,
       archA, archB, archC, archD, archE a0, a1, a2, a3, a4, a5, a6, a7, a8, a9, a10, isob0,  isob1,  isob2,  isob3,
       isob4,  isob5,  isob6, b0, b1, b2, b3, b4, b5, c0, c1, c2, c3, c4, c5, c6, jisb0, jisb1, jisb2, jisb3, jisb4,
       jisb5, jisb6, flsa, flse, halfletter.  Unfortunately, all sizes are currently only available in portrait ori‐
       entation (not landscape).

       By  default,  ps2eps uses an already given %%BoundingBox from the source file, which often corresponds to the
       size of the physical page format for which the document was printed. However, you should be aware  that  this
       already  specified  bounding  box may be not correct, thus resulting in a wrongly cropped (or even no usable)
       .eps-file.  ps2eps can only do as good as ghostscript does in rendering the original postscript file  (though
       ps2eps  even  works  with  negative and fractional values are contained in the original bounding box by using
       automatic translation). Therefore, if the given bounding box is to small or incorrect anyway, you can  ignore
       the  existing  bounding box with the -B option, which will cause ghostscript to use its internal default size
       (or use -s). However, if the BoundingBox has negative coordinates, which is not allowed by the specification,
       ps2eps will shift the output to positive values.

       Hint:  to  avoid  rotating  the picture if you have the original drawing in landscape format, you may use the
       ``Encapsulated Postscript'' option in the printer driver which should generate an EPS file (but with a bound‐
       ing  box  of the sheet size!). But some Windows printer drivers are drawing the image with an offset from the
       bottom of the portrait page, so that a part of it is drawn outside the  landscape  oriented  page.   In  this
       case, you'll have to specify a square size of the page using the maximum length, e.g., 29.7cm x 29.7cm for an
       A4 page.

   CLIPPING
       or why gets some of my text deleted above the included .eps file?

       Some postscript drivers draw a white rectangle from the top left corner of the page to the right lower corner
       of  the  object.  This  may  erase some or even all text above your imported/included EPS file, which is very
       annoying. In order to prevent this, most programs have a clipping option  for  imported  .eps  files  (within
       LaTeX  you  can use \includegraphics*{}) for this purpose. If this is unfortunately not the case, you can use
       the -C option of ps2eps which will (hopefully) do it for you. Unfortunately,  PScript.dll  5.2  (Windows  XP)
       introduced  new  very  badly behaving Postscript code (initclip) which will even override the outer clipping!
       Thus, a new filter had to be installed in ps2eps which will fix it.

       However, because most programs clip directly on the bounding box, you still may loose  some  pixels  of  your
       image,  because the bounding box is described in the coarse resolution of postscript points, i.e. 72 dpi.  In
       order to prevent this, you can use the -l option or -C option (for the latter, clipping by the importing pro‐
       gram should be disabled then) to allow for a 1 point larger bounding box.  -C clips around a 1 point enlarged
       bounding box and -l enlarges the bounding box values by 1 point (you can also combine both options).

   INCLUDED FILTERS
       Some postscript sequences, e.g., for using specific printer features (featurebegin ...), are not working well
       within an .eps file, so ps2eps tries to filter them out. But please note that filters for postscript code may
       not work properly for your printer driver (ps2eps was mainly  tested  with  HP  and  Adobe  printer  drivers,
       although  it  may work for all printers using the PScript.dll). In this case you can try to turn of filtering
       by using option -n, or try to find the bad sequence in the postscript code and adapt the filter rule  in  the
       ps2eps  script  (variables $linefilter, $rangefilter_begin, $rangefilter_end; linefilter is an expression for
       filtering single lines, rangefilter_... are expressions that filter all  lines  between  a  pattern  matching
       $rangefilter_begin  and  $rangefilter_end;  drop  me  an e-mail with your modifications). However, things may
       change as the printer drivers (e.g., PScript.dll) or postscript language evolve.

       Some applications or drivers generate postscript code with leading or trailing binary code, which often  con‐
       fuses  older  postscript  interpreters.  ps2eps  tries to remove such code, but it may sometimes make a wrong
       guess about start and end of the real postscript code (drop me an e-mail with a zipped postscript source, see
       section BUGS).

       Comment  lines  or  even blank lines are removed (which is the default to make .eps files smaller), which may
       corrupt your output. Please check the next section how to fix this.  ps2eps removes blank lines and also <CR>
       (carriage ceturn ``\r'') at the end of lines. However, nicely formatted postscript code gives a hint by using
       ``%%BeginBinary'' ``%%EndBinary'' comments. When ps2eps detects these comments it will refrain from any  fil‐
       tering action within the marked binary sections.

       ps2eps filters also %%Orientation: comments by default (you can use option -O to turn off filtering), because
       ghostscript may ``automagically'' rotate images when generating PDF images, which  is  not  desired  in  most
       cases.  Hint:  you  can  turn  off  that  feature  in  ghostscript  unconditionally  by  specifying -dAutoRo‐
       tatePages=/None.

   CORRUPTED OUTPUT
       Some postscript code may get corrupted when comment lines or even blank  lines  are  removed  (which  is  the
       default  to  make  .eps files smaller), because those files may contain encoded images which also have a % as
       first character in a line or use a special comment as end of image delimiter. If this is the case, use the -c
       option to prevent filtering comments.

   COLOR AND MEMORY
       ps2eps  supports  colored postscript, consequently letting ghostscript consume more resources for drawing its
       bitmap (roughly 6MBytes for an A4 page). bbox is reading the bitmap line by line so it consumes only  minimal
       memory.  If  you  experience  problems  with memory consumption of ghostscript, you may use the -m option for
       using a monochrome image. But this will probably result in wrongly determined  bounding  boxes  with  colored
       images, because ghostscript has to do black/white dithering and may thus suppress objects drawn in light col‐
       ors.

       Another option in case of memory problems and too long run times is to use the  much  more  memory  efficient
       internal ghostscript bbox by using the -g option.

ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES
       Please note that a command line option always takes precedence over the related environment variable.

       The  environment  variable  PS2EPS_SIZE can be used to specify a default page size and take any argument that
       --size accepts.  Examples: export PS2EPS_SIZE=a0 (bash-like syntax) or setenv PS2EPS_SIZE  letter  (csh  syn‐
       tax).

       If the environment variable PS2EPS_GSBBOX is set the internal bbox device of ghostscript will be used instead
       of the external command bbox. Examples: export PS2EPS_GSBBOX=true  (bash-like syntax) or setenv PS2EPS_GSBBOX
       1 (csh syntax).

EXAMPLES
       The usual call is simply: ps2eps -l file

       A relatively failsafe call would be (if your postscript is smaller than iso b0 [100cm x 141.4cm] and you have
       a fast computer with enough memory): ps2eps -l -B -s b0 -c -n file

       If output is not correct try: ps2eps -l -B -s b0 -F file

AUTHOR
       ps2eps was written by Roland Bless.

   WHY?
       Other programs like ps2epsi do not calculate the bounding box always correctly (because the values are put on
       the  postscript  stack which may get corrupted by bad postscript code) or rounded it off so that clipping the
       EPS cut off some part of the image. ps2eps uses a double precision resolution  of  144  dpi  and  appropriate
       rounding  to  get  a  proper bounding box. The internal bbox device of ghostscript generates different values
       (sometimes even incorrect), so using the provided bbox should be more robust.  However, because normal  clip‐
       ping  has only a resolution of 1/72dpi (postscript point), the clipping process may still erase parts of your
       EPS image. In this case please use the -l option to add an additional point of white space around  the  tight
       bounding box.
