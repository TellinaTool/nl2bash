h5cc(1)                                        General Commands Manual                                       h5cc(1)



NAME
       h5cc - Helper script to compile HDF5 applications.

SYNOPSIS
       h5cc [OPTIONS] <compile line>

DESCRIPTION
       h5cc  can  be used in much the same way MPIch is used to compile an HDF5 program. It takes care of specifying
       where the HDF5 header files and libraries are on the command line.

       h5cc supercedes all other compiler scripts in that if you've used them to compile the HDF5 library, then h5cc
       also  uses  those  scripts. For example, when compiling an MPIch program, you use the mpicc script. If you've
       built HDF5 using MPIch, then h5cc uses the MPIch program for compilation.

       Some programs use HDF5 in only a few modules. It isn't necessary to use h5cc to compile those  modules  which
       don't  use HDF5. In fact, since h5cc is only a convenience script, you are still able to compile HDF5 modules
       in the normal way. In that case, you will have to specify the HDF5 libraries and include paths yourself.

       An example of how to use h5cc to compile the program hdf_prog, which consists of modules prog1.c and  prog2.c
       and uses the HDF5 shared library, would be as follows:
              # h5cc -c prog1.c # h5cc -c prog2.c # h5cc -shlib -o hdf_prog prog1.o prog2.o

OPTIONS
       -help  Prints a help message.

       -echo  Show all the shell commands executed.

       -prefix=DIR
              Use  the  directory  DIR to find the HDF5 lib/ and include/ subdirectories.  Default: prefix specified
              when configuring HDF5.

       -show  Show the commands without executing them.

       -shlib Compile using shared HDF5 libraries.

       -noshlib
              Compile using static HDF5 libraries [default].

       <compile line>
              The normal compile line options for your compiler. h5cc uses the same compiler  you  used  to  compile
              HDF5. Check your compiler's manual for more information on which options are needed.

ENVIRONMENT
       HDF5_CC
              Use a different C compiler.

       HDF5_CLINKER
              Use a different linker.

       HDF5_USE_SHLIB=[yes|no]
              Use shared version of the HDF5 library [default: no].
