NAME
       vbetool - run real-mode video BIOS code to alter hardware state


SYNOPSIS
       vbetool   [[vbestate  save|restore]|[vbemode  set|get]|[vgamode]|[dpms  on|off|standby|suspend|reduced]|[post
       [romfile]]|[vgastate on|off]|[vbefp panelid|panelsize|getbrightness|setbrightness|invert]]


DESCRIPTION
       vbetool uses lrmi in order to run code from the video BIOS. Currently, it  is  able  to  alter  DPMS  states,
       save/restore video card state and attempt to initialize the video card from scratch.


OPTIONS
       vbetool takes the following options:

       vbestate
              vbetool will use the VESA 0x4f0f extensions to save or restore hardware state. This will be sent to or
              read from stdin. This information is highly hardware specific - do not attempt to restore state  saved
              from  a  different  machine. This command will not work unless you are at a text console, as it inter‐
              feres badly with X.


       dpms   vbetool will use the VESA 0x4f10 extensions to alter the power management state of your screen.  "On",
              "off",  "standby",  "suspend"  and  "reduced" are acceptable further options and determine which state
              will be activated.


       vbemode
              vbetool will get or set the current VESA mode. "get" will return the current mode number on  stdout  -
              "set" will set the mode to the next argument.


       vgamode
              vbetool will set the legacy VGA mode to the following numeric argument.


       post   vbetool will attempt to run BIOS code located at c000:0003. This is the code run by the system BIOS at
              boot in order to intialise the video hardware. Note that on some machines  (especially  laptops),  not
              all  of  this  code  is  present after system boot - as a result, executing this command may result in
              undefined behaviour. This command must be run from a text console, as it will otherwise interfere with
              the operation of X. This command takes an optional argument which is the location of a file containing
              a ROM image. If provided, this image will be mapped to the c000 segment and used instead of  the  sys‐
              tem's video BIOS.


       vgastate
              vbetool  will  enable  or  disable  the current video card. On most hardware, disabling will cause the
              hardware to stop responding until it is reenabled. You probably don't want to do this if you're  using
              a framebuffer.


       vbefp  vbetool will execute a VESA flat panel interface call.

              panelid will provide information about the panel

              panelsize will provide the size of the panel

              getbrightness will provide the current screen brightness as an integer

              setbrightness accepts an integer as an argument and will set the screen brightness to that

              invert will invert the colours of the screen


BUGS
       Switching dpms modes may interact badly with X on some systems.

       The vbestate command may behave in strange ways.

       The  post  command  may result in the execution of arbitrary code that happens to be lying around in the area
       where chunks of your video BIOS used to be.

       The VESA specification does not require that "vbemode get" provides the correct mode if the current mode  was
       set via some means other than the VESA BIOS extensions.

       The  VESA  flat panel interface ceased development at the proposal stage.  panelid and panelsize will work on
       many machines, but the other arguments are unlikely to be implemented on available hardware.
