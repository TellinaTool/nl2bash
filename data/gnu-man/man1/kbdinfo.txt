NAME
       kbdinfo - obtain information about the status of a console

SYNOPSIS
       kbdinfo [-C DEVICE] getmode [text|graphics]

DESCRIPTION
       kbdinfo  is  an interface to KDGETMODE, GKBMODE, GKBMETA and GKBLED ioctls.  Its primary use case is to query
       the status of the given CONSOLE (or the currently active one, if no  -C  option  is  present)  from  a  shell
       script.

       If the final value argument is not specified, kbdinfo will print the result of the desired ioctl to the stan‐
       dard output.  Otherwise, the given value is compared to the actual result, and the utility will exit  with  a
       status code of 0 for a match, 1 otherwise.  No text is printed for this style of invocation.
