NAME
       dvibook - rearrange pages in DVI file into signatures

SYNOPSIS
       dvibook [ -q ] [ -s<num> ] [ -i infile ] [ -o outfile ] [ infile [ outfile ] ]

DESCRIPTION
       Dvibook  rearranges pages from a DVI file produced by TeX into ``signatures'' for printing books or booklets,
       creating a new DVI file usable by any of the TeX conversion programs.

       The -s option selects the size of signature which will be used. The signature size is  the  number  of  sides
       which will be folded and bound together; the number given should be a multiple of four. The default is to use
       one signature for the whole file. Extra blank sides will be added if the file does not contain a multiple  of
       four pages.

       Dvibook normally prints the page numbers of the pages rearranged; the -q option suppresses this.

BUGS
       Dvibook  does  not adjust the parameters in the postamble; however, since these values are normally used only
       to size certain structures in the output conversion programs, and the parameters never need  to  be  adjusted
       upward, this has not proven to be a problem.
