NAME
       gst-launch - build and run a GStreamer pipeline

SYNOPSIS
       gst-launch [OPTION...] PIPELINE-DESCRIPTION

DESCRIPTION
       gst-launch is a tool that builds and runs basic GStreamer pipelines.

       In  simple  form, a PIPELINE-DESCRIPTION is a list of elements separated by exclamation marks (!). Properties
       may be appended to elements, in the form property=value.

       For a complete description of possible PIPELINE-DESCRIPTIONS see the section pipeline  description  below  or
       consult the GStreamer documentation.

       Please  note  that  gst-launch  is  primarily a debugging tool for developers and users. You should not build
       applications on top of it. For applications, use the gst_parse_launch() function of the GStreamer API  as  an
       easy way to construct pipelines from pipeline descriptions.

OPTIONS
       gst-launch accepts the following options:

       --help  Print help synopsis and available FLAGS

       -v, --verbose
               Output status information and property notifications

       -q, --quiet
               Do not print any progress information

       -m, --messages
               Output messages posted on the pipeline's bus

       -t, --tags
               Output tags (also known as metadata)

       -e, --eos-on-shutdown
               Force  an  EOS event on sources before shutting the pipeline down. This is useful to make sure muxers
               create readable files when a muxing pipeline is shut down forcefully via Control-C.

       -i, --index
               Gather and print index statistics. This is mostly useful for playback or recording pipelines.

       -o FILE, --output=FILE
               Save XML representation of pipeline to FILE and exit (DEPRECATED, DO NOT USE)

       -f, --no-fault
               Do not install a fault handler

       --no-sigusr-handler
               Do not install signal handlers for SIGUSR1 (play) and SIGUSR2 (stop)

       -T, --trace
               Print memory allocation traces. The feature must be enabled at compile time to work.



       GSTREAMER OPTIONS
              gst-launch also accepts the following options that are common to all GStreamer applications:

       --gst-version
               Prints the version string of the GStreamer core library.

       --gst-fatal-warnings
               Causes GStreamer to abort if a warning message occurs. This is equivalent to setting the  environment
               variable  G_DEBUG to 'fatal_warnings' (see the section environment variables below for further infor‐
               mation).

       --gst-debug=STRING
               A comma separated list of category_name:level pairs to specify debugging levels  for  each  category.
               Level is in the range 0-5 where 0 will show no messages, and 5 will show all messages. The wildcard *
               can be used to match category names.

               Use --gst-debug-help to show category names

               Example: GST_CAT:5,GST_ELEMENT_*:3,oggdemux:5


       --gst-debug-level=LEVEL
               Sets the threshold for printing debugging messages.  A higher level will print  more  messages.   The
               useful range is 0-5, with the default being 0.

       --gst-debug-no-color
               GStreamer  normally  prints debugging messages so that the messages are color-coded when printed to a
               terminal that handles ANSI escape sequences.  Using this option causes GStreamer  to  print  messages
               without color. Setting the GST_DEBUG_NO_COLOR environment variable will achieve the same thing.

       --gst-debug-disable
               Disables debugging.

       --gst-debug-help
               Prints a list of available debug categories and their default debugging level.

       --gst-plugin-spew
               GStreamer info flags to set Enable printout of errors while loading GStreamer plugins

       --gst-plugin-path=PATH
               Add directories separated with ':' to the plugin search path

       --gst-plugin-load=PLUGINS
               Preload  plugins specified in a comma-separated list. Another way to specify plugins to preload is to
               use the environment variable GST_PLUGIN_PATH


PIPELINE DESCRIPTION
       A pipeline consists elements and links. Elements can be put into bins of different sorts. Elements, links and
       bins can be specified in a pipeline description in any order.

       Elements

       ELEMENTTYPE [PROPERTY1 ...]

       Creates an element of type ELEMENTTYPE and sets the PROPERTIES.

       Properties

       PROPERTY=VALUE ...

       Sets the property to the specified value. You can use gst-inspect(1) to find out about properties and allowed
       values of different elements.
       Enumeration properties can be set by name, nick or value.

       Bins

       [BINTYPE.] ( [PROPERTY1 ...] PIPELINE-DESCRIPTION )

       Specifies that a bin of type BINTYPE is created and the given properties are set. Every element  between  the
       braces  is put into the bin. Please note the dot that has to be used after the BINTYPE. You will almost never
       need this functionality, it is only really useful for applications  using  the  gst_launch_parse()  API  with
       'bin'  as  bintype.  That  way  it is possible to build partial pipelines instead of a full-fledged top-level
       pipeline.

       Links

       [[SRCELEMENT].[PAD1,...]]  !  [[SINKELEMENT].[PAD1,...]]   [[SRCELEMENT].[PAD1,...]]  !  CAPS  !   [[SINKELE‐
       MENT].[PAD1,...]]

       Links the element with name SRCELEMENT to the element with name SINKELEMENT, using the caps specified in CAPS
       as a filter.  Names can be set on elements with the name property. If the name is omitted, the  element  that
       was  specified directly in front of or after the link is used. This works across bins. If a padname is given,
       the link is done with these pads. If no pad names are given all possibilities are tried and a matching pad is
       used.   If  multiple  padnames are given, both sides must have the same number of pads specified and multiple
       links are done in the given order.
       So the simplest link is a simple exclamation mark, that links the element to the left of it  to  the  element
       right of it.

       Caps

       MIMETYPE [, PROPERTY[, PROPERTY ...]]] [; CAPS[; CAPS ...]]

       Creates  a  capability  with  the  given  mimetype  and optionally with given properties. The mimetype can be
       escaped using " or '.  If you want to chain caps, you can add more caps in the same format afterwards.

       Properties

       NAME=[(TYPE)]VALUE
       in lists and ranges: [(TYPE)]VALUE

       Sets the requested property in capabilities. The name is an alphanumeric value and the type can have the fol‐
       lowing case-insensitive values:
       - i or int for integer values or ranges
       - f or float for float values or ranges
       - 4 or fourcc for FOURCC values
       - b, bool or boolean for boolean values
       - s, str or string for strings
       - fraction for fractions (framerate, pixel-aspect-ratio)
       - l or list for lists
       If no type was given, the following order is tried: integer, float, boolean, string.
       Integer  values  must  be  parsable  by strtol(), floats by strtod(). FOURCC values may either be integers or
       strings. Boolean values are (case insensitive) yes, no, true or false and may like strings be escaped with  "
       or '.
       Ranges are in this format:  [ VALUE, VALUE ]
       Lists use this format:      ( VALUE [, VALUE ...] )


PIPELINE CONTROL
       A pipeline can be controlled by signals. SIGUSR2 will stop the pipeline (GST_STATE_NULL); SIGUSR1 will put it
       back to play (GST_STATE_PLAYING).  By default, the pipeline will start in the playing state.
       There are currently no signals defined to go into the ready or pause (GST_STATE_READY  and  GST_STATE_PAUSED)
       state explicitly.


PIPELINE EXAMPLES
       The examples below assume that you have the correct plug-ins available.  In general, "osssink" can be substi‐
       tuted with another audio output plug-in such as "esdsink", "alsasink", "osxaudiosink", or "artsdsink".  Like‐
       wise,  "xvimagesink"  can be substituted with "ximagesink", "sdlvideosink", "osxvideosink", or "aasink". Keep
       in mind though that different sinks might accept different formats and even the same sink might  accept  dif‐
       ferent  formats  on  different  machines,  so  you might need to add converter elements like audioconvert and
       audioresample (for audio) or ffmpegcolorspace (for video) in front of the sink to make things work.

       Audio playback

               gst-launch filesrc location=music.mp3 ! mad ! audioconvert ! audioresample ! osssink
       Play the mp3 music file "music.mp3" using a libmad-based plug-in and output to an OSS device

               gst-launch filesrc location=music.ogg ! oggdemux ! vorbisdec ! audioconvert ! audioresample ! osssink
       Play an Ogg Vorbis format file

               gst-launch gnomevfssrc location=music.mp3 ! mad ! osssink
               gst-launch gnomevfssrc location=http://domain.com/music.mp3 ! mad ! audioconvert  !  audioresample  !
       osssink
       Play an mp3 file or an http stream using GNOME-VFS

               gst-launch  gnomevfssrc  location=smb://computer/music.mp3  !  mad  !  audioconvert ! audioresample !
       osssink
       Use GNOME-VFS to play an mp3 file located on an SMB server

       Format conversion

               gst-launch filesrc location=music.mp3 ! mad ! audioconvert ! vorbisenc  !  oggmux  !  filesink  loca‐
       tion=music.ogg
       Convert an mp3 music file to an Ogg Vorbis file

               gst-launch filesrc location=music.mp3 ! mad ! audioconvert ! flacenc ! filesink location=test.flac
       Convert to the FLAC format

       Other

               gst-launch filesrc location=music.wav ! wavparse ! audioconvert ! audioresample ! osssink
       Plays a .WAV file that contains raw audio data (PCM).

               gst-launch filesrc location=music.wav ! wavparse ! audioconvert ! vorbisenc ! oggmux ! filesink loca‐
       tion=music.ogg
               gst-launch filesrc location=music.wav ! wavparse ! audioconvert ! lame ! filesink location=music.mp3
       Convert a .WAV file containing raw audio data into an Ogg Vorbis or mp3 file

               gst-launch cdparanoiasrc mode=continuous ! audioconvert ! lame ! id3v2mux ! filesink location=cd.mp3
       rips all tracks from compact disc and convert them into a single mp3 file

               gst-launch cdparanoiasrc track=5 ! audioconvert ! lame ! id3v2mux ! filesink location=track5.mp3
       rips track 5 from the CD and converts it into a single mp3 file

       Using gst-inspect(1), it is possible to discover settings like the above for cdparanoiasrc that will tell  it
       to  rip  the entire cd or only tracks of it.  Alternatively, you can use an URI and gst-launch-0.10 will find
       an element (such as cdparanoia) that supports that protocol for you, e.g.:
              gst-launch cdda://5 ! lame vbr=new vbr-quality=6 ! filesink location=track5.mp3

               gst-launch osssrc ! audioconvert ! vorbisenc ! oggmux ! filesink location=input.ogg
       records sound from your audio input and encodes it into an ogg file

       Video

               gst-launch filesrc location=JB_FF9_TheGravityOfLove.mpg ! dvddemux ! mpeg2dec ! xvimagesink
       Display only the video portion of an MPEG-1 video file, outputting to an X display window

               gst-launch filesrc location=/flflfj.vob ! dvddemux ! mpeg2dec ! sdlvideosink
       Display the video portion of a .vob file (used on DVDs), outputting to an SDL window

               gst-launch filesrc location=movie.mpg  !  dvddemux  name=demuxer   demuxer.  !  queue  !  mpeg2dec  !
       sdlvideosink  demuxer. ! queue ! mad ! audioconvert ! audioresample ! osssink
       Play both video and audio portions of an MPEG movie

               gst-launch filesrc location=movie.mpg ! mpegdemux name=demuxer  demuxer. ! queue ! mpeg2dec ! ffmpeg‐
       colorspace ! sdlvideosink   demuxer. ! queue ! mad ! audioconvert ! audioresample ! osssink
       Play an AVI movie with an external text subtitle stream

       This example also shows how to refer to specific pads by name if an element (here: textoverlay) has  multiple
       sink or source pads.

               gst-launch  textoverlay  name=overlay ! ffmpegcolorspace ! videoscale ! autovideosink   filesrc loca‐
       tion=movie.avi ! decodebin2 ! ffmpegcolorspace ! overlay.video_sink   filesrc location=movie.srt ! subparse !
       overlay.text_sink

       Play an AVI movie with an external text subtitle stream using playbin2

               gst-launch playbin2 uri=file:///path/to/movie.avi suburi=file:///path/to/movie.srt

       Network streaming

       Stream video using RTP and network elements.

               gst-launch  v4l2src  ! video/x-raw-yuv,width=128,height=96,format='(fourcc)'UYVY ! ffmpegcolorspace !
       ffenc_h263 ! video/x-h263 ! rtph263ppay pt=96 ! udpsink host=192.168.1.1 port=5000 sync=false
       This command would be run on the transmitter

               gst-launch udpsrc port=5000 ! application/x-rtp, clock-rate=90000,payload=96 !  rtph263pdepay  queue-
       delay=0 ! ffdec_h263 ! xvimagesink
       Use this command on the receiver

       Diagnostic

               gst-launch -v fakesrc num-buffers=16 ! fakesink
       Generate a null stream and ignore it (and print out details).

               gst-launch audiotestsrc ! audioconvert ! audioresample ! osssink
       Generate a pure sine tone to test the audio output

               gst-launch videotestsrc ! xvimagesink
               gst-launch videotestsrc ! ximagesink
       Generate a familiar test pattern to test the video output

       Automatic linking

       You can use the decodebin element to automatically select the right elements to get a working pipeline.

               gst-launch filesrc location=musicfile ! decodebin ! audioconvert ! audioresample ! osssink
       Play any supported audio format

               gst-launch  filesrc  location=videofile  !  decodebin name=decoder  decoder. ! queue ! audioconvert !
       audioresample ! osssink   decoder. ! ffmpegcolorspace ! xvimagesink
       Play any supported video format with video and audio output. Threads are used  automatically.  To  make  this
       even easier, you can use the playbin element:

               gst-launch playbin uri=file:///home/joe/foo.avi


       Filtered connections

       These examples show you how to use filtered caps.

               gst-launch videotestsrc ! 'video/x-raw-yuv,format=(fourcc)YUY2;video/x-raw-yuv,format=(fourcc)YV12' !
       xvimagesink
       Show a test image and use the YUY2 or YV12 video format for this.

               gst-launch osssrc !  'audio/x-raw-int,rate=[32000,64000],width=[16,32],depth={16,24,32},signed=(bool‐
       ean)true' ! wavenc ! filesink location=recording.wav
       record  audio  and  write  it  to  a  .wav file. Force usage of signed 16 to 32 bit samples and a sample rate
       between 32kHz and 64KHz.



ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES
       GST_DEBUG
              Comma-separated list of debug categories and levels, e.g.  GST_DEBUG=totem:4,typefind:5

       GST_DEBUG_NO_COLOR
              When this environment variable is set, coloured debug output is disabled.

       GST_DEBUG_DUMP_DOT_DIR
              When set to a filesystem path, store dot files of pipeline graphs there.

       GST_REGISTRY
              Path of the plugin registry file. Default  is  ~/.gstreamer-0.10/registry-CPU.xml  where  CPU  is  the
              machine/cpu  type  GStreamer  was  compiled for, e.g. 'i486', 'i686', 'x86-64', 'ppc', etc. (check the
              output of "uname -i" and "uname -m" for details).

       GST_REGISTRY_UPDATE
              Set to "no" to force GStreamer to assume that no plugins have changed, been  added  or  been  removed.
              This will make GStreamer skip the initial check whether a rebuild of the registry cache is required or
              not. This may be useful in embedded environments where the installed plugins never change. Do not  use
              this option in any other setup.

       GST_PLUGIN_PATH
              Specifies a list of directories to scan for additional plugins.  These take precedence over the system
              plugins.

       GST_PLUGIN_SYSTEM_PATH
              Specifies a list of plugins that are always loaded by default.  If not set, this defaults to the  sys‐
              tem-installed path, and the plugins installed in the user's home directory

       ORC_CODE
              Useful  Orc  environment variable. Set ORC_CODE=debug to enable debuggers such as gdb to create useful
              backtraces from Orc-generated code.  Set ORC_CODE=backup or ORC_CODE=emulate if you suspect Orc's SIMD
              code  generator is producing incorrect code.  (Quite a few important GStreamer plugins like videotest‐
              src, audioconvert or audioresample use Orc).

       G_DEBUG
              Useful GLib environment variable. Set G_DEBUG=fatal_warnings to make GStreamer programs abort  when  a
              critical  warning  such  as  an assertion failure occurs. This is useful if you want to find out which
              part of the code caused that warning to be triggered and under what circumstances. Simply set  G_DEBUG
              as  mentioned  above  and  run the program in gdb (or let it core dump). Then get a stack trace in the
              usual way.

FILES
       ~/.gstreamer-0.10/registry-*.xml
               The xml plugin database; can be deleted at any time, will be re-created automatically  when  it  does
               not exist yet or plugins change.
