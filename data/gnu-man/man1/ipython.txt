ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES
       IPYTHONDIR
           This is the location where IPython stores all its configuration files.  The default is $HOME/.ipython  if
           IPYTHONDIR is not defined.

           You can see the computed value of IPYTHONDIR with `ipython locate`.


FILES
       IPython  uses various configuration files stored in profiles within IPYTHONDIR.  To generate the default con‐
       figuration files and start configuring IPython, do 'ipython profile create',  and  edit  '*_config.py'  files
       located in IPYTHONDIR/profile_default.
