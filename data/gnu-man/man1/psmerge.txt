NAME
       psmerge - filter to merge several PostScript files into one

SYNOPSIS
       psmerge [ -oout.ps ] file.ps ...

DESCRIPTION
       Psmerge  merges PostScript documents into a single document. It only works in the specific case the the files
       were created using the same application, with the same device setup and resources (fonts, procsets, patterns,
       files, etc) loaded.

       If the -o option is used, output will be sent to the file named, otherwise it will go to standard output.

       Psmerge will merge multiple files concatenated into a single file as if they were in separate files.
