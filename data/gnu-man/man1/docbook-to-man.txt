docbook-to-man(1)                              General Commands Manual                             docbook-to-man(1)



NAME
       docbook-to-man — convert DocBook       SGML into roff -man macros

SYNOPSIS
       docbook-to-man [source.sgml]  [>]  [destination.1]

DESCRIPTION
       The  docbook-to-man  tool  is  a  batch  converter  that transforms UNIX-style manpages from the DocBook SGML
       DTD into nroff/troff -man macros.

       docbook-to-man is the shell command that runs the low-level components to translate  a  single  DocBook  SGML
       document  instance  (whose  document element is <RefEntry>) into pretty-much vanilla -man macros, with tables
       rendered in tbl.

       This is not the original version by Fred Dalrymple, but  one  with  the  ANS  Modifications  by  David  Bolen
       (db3l@ans.net).

White space and special characters
       If you want to use tabs in your manpage you should use <programlisting>, <literal>  or  <screen>  and  invoke
       docbook-to-man  with  INSTANT_OPT  set to a tab character. Be aware that multiple tabs will be collapsed into
       one.

       When you want to collapse white space into one, you should invoke docbook-to-man with INSTANT_OPT  set  to  a
       space character.

       Special characters like \, ' or . will not be interpreted if you set INSTANT_OPT to a space or tab character.

ENVIRONMENT
       If the variable INSTANT_OPT is not set, the instant(1) is called with the parameter -d by docbook-to-man.  If
       you don't want this, e.g. if you want to use some special characters literally in your SGML file, you can set
       INSTANT_OPT to just a space character:

       INSTANT_OPT=" " docbook-to-man src.sgml > dst.1

       Note:  The better way to use special characters like ^ or > is to write them in the SGML way, i.e. &caret; or
       &gt;.
