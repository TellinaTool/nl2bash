NAME
       git - the stupid content tracker

SYNOPSIS
       git [--version] [--help] [-C <path>] [-c <name>=<value>]
           [--exec-path[=<path>]] [--html-path] [--man-path] [--info-path]
           [-p|--paginate|--no-pager] [--no-replace-objects] [--bare]
           [--git-dir=<path>] [--work-tree=<path>] [--namespace=<name>]
           <command> [<args>]


DESCRIPTION
       Git is a fast, scalable, distributed revision control system with an unusually rich command set that provides
       both high-level operations and full access to internals.

       See gittutorial(7) to get started, then see Everyday Git[1] for a useful minimum set of commands. The Git
       User’s Manual[2] has a more in-depth introduction.

       After you mastered the basic concepts, you can come back to this page to learn what commands Git offers. You
       can learn more about individual Git commands with "git help command". gitcli(7) manual page gives you an
       overview of the command line command syntax.

       Formatted and hyperlinked version of the latest Git documentation can be viewed at
       http://git-htmldocs.googlecode.com/git/git.html.

OPTIONS
       --version
           Prints the Git suite version that the git program came from.

       --help
           Prints the synopsis and a list of the most commonly used commands. If the option --all or -a is given
           then all available commands are printed. If a Git command is named this option will bring up the manual
           page for that command.

           Other options are available to control how the manual page is displayed. See git-help(1) for more
           information, because git --help ...  is converted internally into git help ....

       -C <path>
           Run as if git was started in <path> instead of the current working directory. When multiple -C options
           are given, each subsequent non-absolute -C <path> is interpreted relative to the preceding -C <path>.

           This option affects options that expect path name like --git-dir and --work-tree in that their
           interpretations of the path names would be made relative to the working directory caused by the -C
           option. For example the following invocations are equivalent:

               git --git-dir=a.git --work-tree=b -C c status
               git --git-dir=c/a.git --work-tree=c/b status

       -c <name>=<value>
           Pass a configuration parameter to the command. The value given will override values from configuration
           files. The <name> is expected in the same format as listed by git config (subkeys separated by dots).

       --exec-path[=<path>]
           Path to wherever your core Git programs are installed. This can also be controlled by setting the
           GIT_EXEC_PATH environment variable. If no path is given, git will print the current setting and then
           exit.

       --html-path
           Print the path, without trailing slash, where Git’s HTML documentation is installed and exit.

       --man-path
           Print the manpath (see man(1)) for the man pages for this version of Git and exit.

       --info-path
           Print the path where the Info files documenting this version of Git are installed and exit.

       -p, --paginate
           Pipe all output into less (or if set, $PAGER) if standard output is a terminal. This overrides the
           pager.<cmd> configuration options (see the "Configuration Mechanism" section below).

       --no-pager
           Do not pipe Git output into a pager.

       --git-dir=<path>
           Set the path to the repository. This can also be controlled by setting the GIT_DIR environment variable.
           It can be an absolute path or relative path to current working directory.

       --work-tree=<path>
           Set the path to the working tree. It can be an absolute path or a path relative to the current working
           directory. This can also be controlled by setting the GIT_WORK_TREE environment variable and the
           core.worktree configuration variable (see core.worktree in git-config(1) for a more detailed discussion).

       --namespace=<path>
           Set the Git namespace. See gitnamespaces(7) for more details. Equivalent to setting the GIT_NAMESPACE
           environment variable.

       --bare
           Treat the repository as a bare repository. If GIT_DIR environment is not set, it is set to the current
           working directory.

       --no-replace-objects
           Do not use replacement refs to replace Git objects. See git-replace(1) for more information.

       --literal-pathspecs
           Treat pathspecs literally (i.e. no globbing, no pathspec magic). This is equivalent to setting the
           GIT_LITERAL_PATHSPECS environment variable to 1.

       --glob-pathspecs
           Add "glob" magic to all pathspec. This is equivalent to setting the GIT_GLOB_PATHSPECS environment
           variable to 1. Disabling globbing on individual pathspecs can be done using pathspec magic ":(literal)"

       --noglob-pathspecs
           Add "literal" magic to all pathspec. This is equivalent to setting the GIT_NOGLOB_PATHSPECS environment
           variable to 1. Enabling globbing on individual pathspecs can be done using pathspec magic ":(glob)"

       --icase-pathspecs
           Add "icase" magic to all pathspec. This is equivalent to setting the GIT_ICASE_PATHSPECS environment
           variable to 1.

LOW-LEVEL COMMANDS (PLUMBING)
       Although Git includes its own porcelain layer, its low-level commands are sufficient to support development
       of alternative porcelains. Developers of such porcelains might start by reading about git-update-index(1) and
       git-read-tree(1).

       The interface (input, output, set of options and the semantics) to these low-level commands are meant to be a
       lot more stable than Porcelain level commands, because these commands are primarily for scripted use. The
       interface to Porcelain commands on the other hand are subject to change in order to improve the end user
       experience.

       The following description divides the low-level commands into commands that manipulate objects (in the
       repository, index, and working tree), commands that interrogate and compare objects, and commands that move
       objects and references between repositories.

CONFIGURATION MECHANISM
       Git uses a simple text format to store customizations that are per repository and are per user. Such a
       configuration file may look like this:

           #
           # A '#' or ';' character indicates a comment.
           #

           ; core variables
           [core]
                   ; Don't trust file modes
                   filemode = false

           ; user identity
           [user]
                   name = "Junio C Hamano"
                   email = "gitster@pobox.com"


       Various commands read from the configuration file and adjust their operation accordingly. See git-config(1)
       for a list and more details about the configuration mechanism.

IDENTIFIER TERMINOLOGY
       <object>
           Indicates the object name for any type of object.

       <blob>
           Indicates a blob object name.

       <tree>
           Indicates a tree object name.

       <commit>
           Indicates a commit object name.

       <tree-ish>
           Indicates a tree, commit or tag object name. A command that takes a <tree-ish> argument ultimately wants
           to operate on a <tree> object but automatically dereferences <commit> and <tag> objects that point at a
           <tree>.

       <commit-ish>
           Indicates a commit or tag object name. A command that takes a <commit-ish> argument ultimately wants to
           operate on a <commit> object but automatically dereferences <tag> objects that point at a <commit>.

       <type>
           Indicates that an object type is required. Currently one of: blob, tree, commit, or tag.

       <file>
           Indicates a filename - almost always relative to the root of the tree structure GIT_INDEX_FILE describes.

SYMBOLIC IDENTIFIERS
       Any Git command accepting any <object> can also use the following symbolic notation:

       HEAD
           indicates the head of the current branch.

       <tag>
           a valid tag name (i.e. a refs/tags/<tag> reference).

       <head>
           a valid head name (i.e. a refs/heads/<head> reference).

       For a more complete list of ways to spell object names, see "SPECIFYING REVISIONS" section in
       gitrevisions(7).

FILE/DIRECTORY STRUCTURE
       Please see the gitrepository-layout(5) document.

       Read githooks(5) for more details about each hook.

       Higher level SCMs may provide and manage additional information in the $GIT_DIR.

TERMINOLOGY
       Please see gitglossary(7).

ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES
       Various Git commands use the following environment variables:

   The Git Repository
       These environment variables apply to all core Git commands. Nb: it is worth noting that they may be
       used/overridden by SCMS sitting above Git so take care if using Cogito etc.

       GIT_INDEX_FILE
           This environment allows the specification of an alternate index file. If not specified, the default of
           $GIT_DIR/index is used.

       GIT_OBJECT_DIRECTORY
           If the object storage directory is specified via this environment variable then the sha1 directories are
           created underneath - otherwise the default $GIT_DIR/objects directory is used.

       GIT_ALTERNATE_OBJECT_DIRECTORIES
           Due to the immutable nature of Git objects, old objects can be archived into shared, read-only
           directories. This variable specifies a ":" separated (on Windows ";" separated) list of Git object
           directories which can be used to search for Git objects. New objects will not be written to these
           directories.

       GIT_DIR
           If the GIT_DIR environment variable is set then it specifies a path to use instead of the default .git
           for the base of the repository. The --git-dir command-line option also sets this value.

       GIT_WORK_TREE
           Set the path to the root of the working tree. This can also be controlled by the --work-tree command line
           option and the core.worktree configuration variable.

       GIT_NAMESPACE
           Set the Git namespace; see gitnamespaces(7) for details. The --namespace command-line option also sets
           this value.

       GIT_CEILING_DIRECTORIES
           This should be a colon-separated list of absolute paths. If set, it is a list of directories that Git
           should not chdir up into while looking for a repository directory (useful for excluding slow-loading
           network directories). It will not exclude the current working directory or a GIT_DIR set on the command
           line or in the environment. Normally, Git has to read the entries in this list and resolve any symlink
           that might be present in order to compare them with the current directory. However, if even this access
           is slow, you can add an empty entry to the list to tell Git that the subsequent entries are not symlinks
           and needn’t be resolved; e.g., GIT_CEILING_DIRECTORIES=/maybe/symlink::/very/slow/non/symlink.

       GIT_DISCOVERY_ACROSS_FILESYSTEM
           When run in a directory that does not have ".git" repository directory, Git tries to find such a
           directory in the parent directories to find the top of the working tree, but by default it does not cross
           filesystem boundaries. This environment variable can be set to true to tell Git not to stop at filesystem
           boundaries. Like GIT_CEILING_DIRECTORIES, this will not affect an explicit repository directory set via
           GIT_DIR or on the command line.

   Git Commits
       GIT_AUTHOR_NAME, GIT_AUTHOR_EMAIL, GIT_AUTHOR_DATE, GIT_COMMITTER_NAME, GIT_COMMITTER_EMAIL,
       GIT_COMMITTER_DATE, EMAIL
           see git-commit-tree(1)

   Git Diffs
       GIT_DIFF_OPTS
           Only valid setting is "--unified=??" or "-u??" to set the number of context lines shown when a unified
           diff is created. This takes precedence over any "-U" or "--unified" option value passed on the Git diff
           command line.

       GIT_EXTERNAL_DIFF
           When the environment variable GIT_EXTERNAL_DIFF is set, the program named by it is called, instead of the
           diff invocation described above. For a path that is added, removed, or modified, GIT_EXTERNAL_DIFF is
           called with 7 parameters:

               path old-file old-hex old-mode new-file new-hex new-mode

           where:

       <old|new>-file
           are files GIT_EXTERNAL_DIFF can use to read the contents of <old|new>,

       <old|new>-hex
           are the 40-hexdigit SHA-1 hashes,

       <old|new>-mode
           are the octal representation of the file modes.

           The file parameters can point at the user’s working file (e.g.  new-file in "git-diff-files"), /dev/null
           (e.g.  old-file when a new file is added), or a temporary file (e.g.  old-file in the index).
           GIT_EXTERNAL_DIFF should not worry about unlinking the temporary file --- it is removed when
           GIT_EXTERNAL_DIFF exits.

           For a path that is unmerged, GIT_EXTERNAL_DIFF is called with 1 parameter, <path>.

           For each path GIT_EXTERNAL_DIFF is called, two environment variables, GIT_DIFF_PATH_COUNTER and
           GIT_DIFF_PATH_TOTAL are set.

       GIT_DIFF_PATH_COUNTER
           A 1-based counter incremented by one for every path.

       GIT_DIFF_PATH_TOTAL
           The total number of paths.

   other
       GIT_MERGE_VERBOSITY
           A number controlling the amount of output shown by the recursive merge strategy. Overrides
           merge.verbosity. See git-merge(1)

       GIT_PAGER
           This environment variable overrides $PAGER. If it is set to an empty string or to the value "cat", Git
           will not launch a pager. See also the core.pager option in git-config(1).

       GIT_EDITOR
           This environment variable overrides $EDITOR and $VISUAL. It is used by several Git commands when, on
           interactive mode, an editor is to be launched. See also git-var(1) and the core.editor option in git-
           config(1).

       GIT_SSH
           If this environment variable is set then git fetch and git push will use this command instead of ssh when
           they need to connect to a remote system. The $GIT_SSH command will be given exactly two or four
           arguments: the username@host (or just host) from the URL and the shell command to execute on that remote
           system, optionally preceded by -p (literally) and the port from the URL when it specifies something other
           than the default SSH port.

           To pass options to the program that you want to list in GIT_SSH you will need to wrap the program and
           options into a shell script, then set GIT_SSH to refer to the shell script.

           Usually it is easier to configure any desired options through your personal .ssh/config file. Please
           consult your ssh documentation for further details.

       GIT_ASKPASS
           If this environment variable is set, then Git commands which need to acquire passwords or passphrases
           (e.g. for HTTP or IMAP authentication) will call this program with a suitable prompt as command line
           argument and read the password from its STDOUT. See also the core.askpass option in git-config(1).

       GIT_CONFIG_NOSYSTEM
           Whether to skip reading settings from the system-wide $(prefix)/etc/gitconfig file. This environment
           variable can be used along with $HOME and $XDG_CONFIG_HOME to create a predictable environment for a
           picky script, or you can set it temporarily to avoid using a buggy /etc/gitconfig file while waiting for
           someone with sufficient permissions to fix it.

       GIT_FLUSH
           If this environment variable is set to "1", then commands such as git blame (in incremental mode), git
           rev-list, git log, git check-attr and git check-ignore will force a flush of the output stream after each
           record have been flushed. If this variable is set to "0", the output of these commands will be done using
           completely buffered I/O. If this environment variable is not set, Git will choose buffered or
           record-oriented flushing based on whether stdout appears to be redirected to a file or not.

       GIT_TRACE
           If this variable is set to "1", "2" or "true" (comparison is case insensitive), Git will print trace:
           messages on stderr telling about alias expansion, built-in command execution and external command
           execution. If this variable is set to an integer value greater than 1 and lower than 10 (strictly) then
           Git will interpret this value as an open file descriptor and will try to write the trace messages into
           this file descriptor. Alternatively, if this variable is set to an absolute path (starting with a /
           character), Git will interpret this as a file path and will try to write the trace messages into it.

       GIT_TRACE_PACK_ACCESS
           If this variable is set to a path, a file will be created at the given path logging all accesses to any
           packs. For each access, the pack file name and an offset in the pack is recorded. This may be helpful for
           troubleshooting some pack-related performance problems.

       GIT_TRACE_PACKET
           If this variable is set, it shows a trace of all packets coming in or out of a given program. This can
           help with debugging object negotiation or other protocol issues. Tracing is turned off at a packet
           starting with "PACK".

       GIT_LITERAL_PATHSPECS
           Setting this variable to 1 will cause Git to treat all pathspecs literally, rather than as glob patterns.
           For example, running GIT_LITERAL_PATHSPECS=1 git log -- '*.c' will search for commits that touch the path
           *.c, not any paths that the glob *.c matches. You might want this if you are feeding literal paths to Git
           (e.g., paths previously given to you by git ls-tree, --raw diff output, etc).

       GIT_GLOB_PATHSPECS
           Setting this variable to 1 will cause Git to treat all pathspecs as glob patterns (aka "glob" magic).

       GIT_NOGLOB_PATHSPECS
           Setting this variable to 1 will cause Git to treat all pathspecs as literal (aka "literal" magic).

       GIT_ICASE_PATHSPECS
           Setting this variable to 1 will cause Git to treat all pathspecs as case-insensitive.

       GIT_REFLOG_ACTION
           When a ref is updated, reflog entries are created to keep track of the reason why the ref was updated
           (which is typically the name of the high-level command that updated the ref), in addition to the old and
           new values of the ref. A scripted Porcelain command can use set_reflog_action helper function in
           git-sh-setup to set its name to this variable when it is invoked as the top level command by the end
           user, to be recorded in the body of the reflog.

DISCUSSION
       More detail on the following is available from the Git concepts chapter of the user-manual[3] and gitcore-
       tutorial(7).

       A Git project normally consists of a working directory with a ".git" subdirectory at the top level. The .git
       directory contains, among other things, a compressed object database representing the complete history of the
       project, an "index" file which links that history to the current contents of the working tree, and named
       pointers into that history such as tags and branch heads.

       The object database contains objects of three main types: blobs, which hold file data; trees, which point to
       blobs and other trees to build up directory hierarchies; and commits, which each reference a single tree and
       some number of parent commits.

       The commit, equivalent to what other systems call a "changeset" or "version", represents a step in the
       project’s history, and each parent represents an immediately preceding step. Commits with more than one
       parent represent merges of independent lines of development.

       All objects are named by the SHA-1 hash of their contents, normally written as a string of 40 hex digits.
       Such names are globally unique. The entire history leading up to a commit can be vouched for by signing just
       that commit. A fourth object type, the tag, is provided for this purpose.

       When first created, objects are stored in individual files, but for efficiency may later be compressed
       together into "pack files".

       Named pointers called refs mark interesting points in history. A ref may contain the SHA-1 name of an object
       or the name of another ref. Refs with names beginning ref/head/ contain the SHA-1 name of the most recent
       commit (or "head") of a branch under development. SHA-1 names of tags of interest are stored under ref/tags/.
       A special ref named HEAD contains the name of the currently checked-out branch.

       The index file is initialized with a list of all paths and, for each path, a blob object and a set of
       attributes. The blob object represents the contents of the file as of the head of the current branch. The
       attributes (last modified time, size, etc.) are taken from the corresponding file in the working tree.
       Subsequent changes to the working tree can be found by comparing these attributes. The index may be updated
       with new content, and new commits may be created from the content stored in the index.

       The index is also capable of storing multiple entries (called "stages") for a given pathname. These stages
       are used to hold the various unmerged version of a file when a merge is in progress.

FURTHER DOCUMENTATION
       See the references in the "description" section to get started using Git. The following is probably more
       detail than necessary for a first-time user.

       The Git concepts chapter of the user-manual[3] and gitcore-tutorial(7) both provide introductions to the
       underlying Git architecture.

       See gitworkflows(7) for an overview of recommended workflows.

       See also the howto[4] documents for some useful examples.

       The internals are documented in the Git API documentation[5].

       Users migrating from CVS may also want to read gitcvs-migration(7).

       GIT_ALLOW_PROTOCOL
           If set, provide a colon-separated list of protocols which are allowed to be used with fetch/push/clone.
           This is useful to restrict recursive submodule initialization from an untrusted repository. Any protocol
           not mentioned will be disallowed (i.e., this is a whitelist, not a blacklist). If the variable is not set
           at all, all protocols are enabled. The protocol names currently used by git are:

           ·   file: any local file-based path (including file:// URLs, or local paths)

           ·   git: the anonymous git protocol over a direct TCP connection (or proxy, if configured)

           ·   ssh: git over ssh (including host:path syntax, git+ssh://, etc).

           ·   rsync: git over rsync

           ·   http: git over http, both "smart http" and "dumb http". Note that this does not include https; if you
               want both, you should specify both as http:https.

           ·   any external helpers are named by their protocol (e.g., use hg to allow the git-remote-hg helper)
