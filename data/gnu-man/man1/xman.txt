NAME
       xman - Manual page display program for the X Window System

SYNOPSIS
       xman [ -options ... ]

DESCRIPTION
       Xman is a manual page browser.  The default size of the initial xman window is small so that you can leave it
       running throughout your entire login session.  In the initial window there are three options: Help  will  pop
       up  a  window  with  on-line  help,  Quit  will exit, and Manual Page will pop up a window with a manual page
       browser in it.  Typing Control-S will pop up a window prompting for a specific manual page to  display.   You
       may display more than one manual page browser window at a time from a single execution of xman.

       For  further  information  on using xman, please read the on-line help information.  Most of this manual will
       discuss customization of xman.

OPTIONS
       Xman supports all standard Toolkit command line arguments (see X(7)).  The following additional arguments are
       supported.


       -helpfile filename
              Specifies a helpfile to use other than the default.

       -bothshown
              Allows both the manual page and manual directory to be on the screen at the same time.

       -notopbox
              Starts without the Top Menu with the three buttons in it.

       -geometry WxH+X+Y
              Sets the size and location of the Top Menu with the three buttons in it.

       -pagesize WxH+X+Y
              Sets the size and location of all the Manual Pages.

CUSTOMIZING XMAN
       Xman  allows  customization  of  both the directories to be searched for manual pages, and the name that each
       directory will map to in the Sections menu.  Xman determines which directories it will search by reading  the
       MANPATH  environment  variable.   If  no MANPATH is found then the directory is /usr/man is searched on POSIX
       systems.  This environment is expected to be a colon-separated list of directories for xman to search.

       setenv MANPATH /mit/kit/man:/usr/man

       By default, xman will search each of the following directories (in each of the directories specified  in  the
       users MANPATH) for manual pages.  If manual pages exist in that directory then they are added to list of man‐
       ual pages for the corresponding menu item.  A menu item is only displayed for those  sections  that  actually
       contain manual pages.


       Directory   Section Name
       -           -
       man1        (1) User Commands
       man2        (2) System Calls
       man3        (3) Subroutines
       man4        (4) Devices
       man5        (5) File Formats
       man6        (6) Games
       man7        (7) Miscellaneous
       man8        (8) Sys. Administration
       manl        (l) Local

       mann        (n) New
       mano        (o) Old

       For  instance, a user has three directories in her manual path and each contain a directory called man3.  All
       these manual pages will appear alphabetically sorted when the user selects the menu item called  (3)  Subrou‐
       tines.  If there is no directory called mano in any of the directories in her MANPATH, or there are no manual
       pages in any of the directories called mano then no menu item will be displayed for the  section  called  (o)
       Old.

BSD AND LINUX SYSTEMS
       In  newer  BSD and Linux systems, Xman will search for a file named /etc/man.conf which will contain the list
       of directories containing manual pages. See man.conf(5) for a complete description of the file format.

THE MANDESC FILE
       By using the mandesc file a user or system manager is able to more closely control which  manual  pages  will
       appear  in  each  of the sections represented by menu items in the Sections menu.  This functionality is only
       available on a section by section basis, and individual manual pages may  not  be  handled  in  this  manner.
       (Although generous use of symbolic links — see ln(1) — will allow almost any configuration you can imagine.)

       The  format  of  the  mandesc file is a character followed by a label.  The character determines which of the
       sections will be added under this label.  For instance suppose that you would like to create  an  extra  menu
       item  that  contains all programmer subroutines.  This label should contain all manual pages in both sections
       two and three.  The mandesc file would look like this:

       2Programmer Subroutines
       3Programmer Subroutines

       This will add a menu item to the Sections menu that would bring up a listing of all manual pages in  sections
       two  and  three  of the Programmers Manual.  Since the label names are exactly the same they will be added to
       the same section. Note, however, that the original sections still exist.

       If you want to completely ignore the default sections in a manual directory then add the line:

       no default sections

       anywhere in your mandesc file.  This keeps xman from searching the default manual sections In that  directory
       only.   As  an example, suppose you want to do the same thing as above, but you don't think that it is useful
       to have the System Calls or Subroutines sections any  longer.   You  would  need  to  duplicate  the  default
       entries, as well as adding your new one.

       no default sections
       1(1) User Commands
       2Programmer Subroutines
       3Programmer Subroutines
       4(4) Devices
       5(5) File Formats
       6(6) Games
       7(7) Miscellaneous
       8(8) Sys. Administration
       l(l) Local
       n(n) New
       o(o) Old

       Xman  will  read  any section that is of the from man<character>, where <character> is an upper or lower case
       letter (they are treated distinctly) or a numeral (0-9).  Be warned, however, that man(1) and catman(8)  will
       not search directories that are non-standard.

WIDGETS
       In  order to specify resources, it is useful to know the hierarchy of the widgets which compose xman.  In the
       notation below, indentation indicates hierarchical structure.  The widget class name is given first, followed
       by the widget instance name.

APPLICATION RESOURCES
       xman has the following application-specific resources which allow customizations unique to xman.

       manualFontNormal (Class Font)
                         The font to use for normal text in the manual pages.

       manualFontBold (Class Font)
                         The font to use for bold text in the manual pages.

       manualFontItalic (Class Font)
                         The font to use for italic text in the manual pages.

       directoryFontNormal (Class Font)
                         The font to use for the directory text.

       bothShown (Class Boolean)
                         Either `true' or `false,' specifies whether or not you want both the directory and the man‐
                         ual page shown at start up.

       directoryHeight (Class DirectoryHeight)
                         The height in pixels of the directory, when the directory and the  manual  page  are  shown
                         simultaneously.

       topCursor (Class Cursor)
                         The cursor to use in the top box.

       helpCursor (Class Cursor)
                         The cursor to use in the help window.

       manpageCursor (Class Cursor)
                         The cursor to use in the manual page window.

       searchEntryCursor (Class Cursor)
                         The cursor to use in the search entry text widget.

       pointerColor (Class Foreground)
                         This is the color of all the cursors (pointers) specified above.  The name was chosen to be
                         compatible with xterm.

       helpFile  (Class File)
                         Use this rather than the system default helpfile.

       topBox (Class Boolean)
                         Either `true' or `false,' determines whether the top box (containing  the  help,  quit  and
                         manual  page  buttons)  or  a manual page is put on the screen at start-up.  The default is
                         true.

       verticalList (Class Boolean)
                         Either `true' or `false,' determines whether the directory listing is vertically  or  hori‐
                         zontally organized.  The default is horizontal (false).

GLOBAL ACTIONS
       Xman defines all user interaction through global actions.  This allows the user to modify the translation ta‐
       ble of any widget, and bind any event to the new user action.  The list of actions supported by xman are:

       GotoPage(page) When used in a manual page display window this will allow the user to move between a directory
                      and manual page display.  The page argument can be either Directory or ManualPage.

       Quit()         This action may be used anywhere, and will exit xman.

       Search(type, action)
                      Only  useful  when used in a search popup, this action will cause the search widget to perform
                      the named search type on the string in the search popup's value widget. This action will  also
                      pop down the search widget. The type argument can be either Apropos, Manpage or Cancel.  If an
                      action of Open is specified then xman will open a new manual page to display  the  results  of
                      the  search,  otherwise  xman  will attempt to display the results in the parent of the search
                      popup.

       PopupHelp()    This action may be used anywhere, and will popup the help widget.

       PopupSearch()  This action may be used anywhere except in a help window.  It will cause the search  popup  to
                      become active and visible on the screen, allowing the user search for a manual page.

       CreateNewManpage()
                      This action may be used anywhere, and will create a new manual page display window.

       RemoveThisManpage()
                      This action may be used in any manual page or help display window.  When called it will remove
                      the window, and clean up all resources associated with it.

       SaveFormattedPage(action)
                      This action can only be used in the likeToSave popup widget, and tells xman whether to Save or
                      Cancel a save of the manual page that has just been formatted.

       ShowVersion()  This  action  may  be  called  from any manual page or help display window, and will cause the
                      informational display line to show the current version of xman.

FILES
       <manpath directory>/man<character>

       <manpath directory>/cat<character>

       <manpath directory>/mandesc

       /etc/X11/app-defaults/Xman
                                specifies required resources.

       /tmp                     Xman creates temporary files in /tmp for all unformatted man pages and  all  apropos
                                searches.
