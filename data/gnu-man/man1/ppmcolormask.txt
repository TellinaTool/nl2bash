NAME
       ppmcolormask - produce mask of areas of a certain color in a PPM file

SYNOPSIS
       ppmcolormask color [ppmfile]

DESCRIPTION
       Reads  a  PPM file as input.  Produces a PBM (bitmap) file as output.  The output file is the same dimensions
       as the input file and is black in all places where the input file is the color color,  and  white  everywhere
       else.

       The  output  of ppmcolormask is useful as an alpha mask input to pnmcomp.  Note that you can generate such an
       alpha mask automatically as you convert to PNG format with pnmtopng(1).  Use its -transparent option.

       ppmfile is the input file.  If you don't specify ppmfile, the input is from Standard Input.

       The output goes to Standard Output.

       You can specify color five ways:

       o      An X11-style color name (e.g.  black).

       o      An X11-style hexadecimal specifier: rgb:r/g/b, where r g and b are each 1- to 4-digit hexadecimal num‐
              bers.

       o      An  X11-style  decimal specifier: rgbi:r/g/b, where r g and b are floating point numbers between 0 and
              1.

       o      For backwards compatibility, an  old-X11-style  hexadecimal  number:  #rgb,  #rrggbb,  #rrrgggbbb,  or
              #rrrrggggbbbb.

       o      For  backwards  compatibility,  a  triplet  of numbers separated by commas: r,g,b, where r g and b are
              floating point numbers between 0 and 1.  (This style was added before MIT came  up  with  the  similar
              rgbi style.)
