NAME
       twistd - run Twisted applications (TACs, TAPs)

SYNOPSIS
       twistd [options]

DESCRIPTION
       Read a twisted.application.service.Application out of a file and run it.

OPTIONS
       -n, --nodaemon Don't daemonize (stay in foreground).

       -q, --quiet
              No-op for backwards compatibility.

       -p, --profile <profile output>
              Run the application under the profiler, dumping results to the specified file.

       --profiler <profiler name>
              Specify the profiler to use. Defaults to the 'hotshot' profiler.

       --savestats
              Save the Stats object rather than the text output of the profiler.

       -b, --debug
              Run  the  application in the Python Debugger (implies --nodaemon option).  Sending a SIGINT or SIGUSR2
              signal to the process will drop it into the debugger.

       -e, --encrypted <file>
              The specified tap/aos file is encrypted.

       --euid Set only effective user-id rather than real user-id. This option has no effect unless  the  server  is
              running  as root, in which case it means not to shed all privileges after binding ports, retaining the
              option to regain privileges in cases such as spawning processes. Use with caution.

       -o, --no_save
              Do not save shutdown state.

       --originalname
              Behave as though the specified Application has no process name set, and run with the standard  process
              name (the Python binary in most cases).

       -l, --logfile <logfile>
              Log to a specified file, - for stdout (default: twistd.log).  The log file will be rotated on SIGUSR1.

       -l, --logger <fully qualified python name>
              A fully-qualified name to a log observer factory to use for the initial log observer. Takes precedence
              over --logfile and --syslog.

       --pidfile <pidfile>
              Save pid in specified file (default: twistd.pid).

       --chroot <directory>
              Chroot to a supplied directory before running (default:  don't  chroot).   Chrooting  is  done  before
              changing the current directory.

       -d, --rundir <directory>
              Change to a supplied directory before running (default: .).

       -u, --uid <uid>
              The uid to run as (default: don't change).

       -g, --gid <gid>
              The gid to run as (default: don't change).

       --umask <mask>
              The (octal) file creation mask to apply. (default: 0077 for daemons, no change otherwise).

       -r, --reactor <reactor>
              Choose which reactor to use. See --help-reactors for a list of possibilities.

       --help-reactors
              List the names of possibly available reactors.

       --spew Write  an  extremely  verbose log of everything that happens. Useful for debugging freezes or locks in
              complex code.

       -f, --file <tap file>
              Read the given .tap file (default: twistd.tap).

       -s, --source <tas file>
              Load an Application from the given .tas (AOT Python source) file.

       -y, --python <python file>
              Use the variable "application" from the given Python file.  This  option  overrides  -f.  This  option
              implies --no_save.

       --syslog
              Log to syslog instead of a file.

       --version
              Print version information and exit.

       --prefix <prefix>
              Use the specified prefix when logging to logfile. Default is "twisted".

       Note that if twistd is run as root, the working directory is not searched for Python modules.

SIGNALS
       A running twistd accepts SIGINT for a clean shutdown and SIGUSR1 to rotate log files.
