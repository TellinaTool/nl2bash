DH_CLEAN(1)                                           Debhelper                                          DH_CLEAN(1)



NAME
       dh_clean - clean up package build directories

SYNOPSIS
       dh_clean [debhelper options] [-k] [-d] [-Xitem] [file ...]

DESCRIPTION
       dh_clean is a debhelper program that is responsible for cleaning up after a package is built. It removes the
       package build directories, and removes some other files including debian/files, and any detritus left behind
       by other debhelper commands. It also removes common files that should not appear in a Debian diff:
         #*# *~ DEADJOE *.orig *.rej *.SUMS TAGS .deps/* *.P *-stamp

       It does not run "make clean" to clean up after the build process. Use dh_auto_clean(1) to do things like
       that.

       dh_clean should be the last debhelper command run in the clean target in debian/rules.

FILES
       debian/clean
           Can list other files to be removed.

OPTIONS
       -k, --keep
           This is deprecated, use dh_prep(1) instead.

       -d, --dirs-only
           Only clean the package build directories, do not clean up any other files at all.

       -Xitem --exclude=item
           Exclude files that contain item anywhere in their filename from being deleted, even if they would
           normally be deleted. You may use this option multiple times to build up a list of things to exclude.

       file ...
           Delete these files too.
