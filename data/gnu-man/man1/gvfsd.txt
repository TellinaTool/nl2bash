NAME
       gvfsd - Main daemon for gvfs

SYNOPSIS
       gvfsd [OPTION...]

DESCRIPTION
       gvfsd is the main daemon for the gvfs virtual filesystem. It provides the org.gtk.vfs.Daemon name on the
       session bus. gvfsd is autostarted by GIO clients if it is not running.

       The primary task of gvfsd is to act as a mount tracker/manager. It spawns new backends when requested and
       keeps track fo their lifecycle, maintaining a list of active mounts and creates direct connections to them.

       Since gvfs backends are running as children of the gvfsd process, it is possible to start gvfsd in a terminal
       and set environment variables to get debug output from individual backends.

       gvfsd also starts the gvfsd-fuse(1), and provides it the mount point where the fuse file system should be
       mounted.

OPTIONS
       -h, --help
           Prints a short help text and exits.

       -r, --replace
           Replace the currently running gvfsd instance.

       --no-fuse
           Don't start the fuse filesystem.

ENVIRONMENT
       GVFS_DISABLE_FUSE
           If this environment variable is set, gvfsd will not start the fuse filesystem.

EXIT STATUS
       On success 0 is returned, a non-zero failure code otherwise.
