NAME
       env - run a program in a modified environment

SYNOPSIS
       env [OPTION]... [-] [NAME=VALUE]... [COMMAND [ARG]...]

DESCRIPTION
       Set each NAME to VALUE in the environment and run COMMAND.

       Mandatory arguments to long options are mandatory for short options too.

       -i, --ignore-environment
              start with an empty environment

       -0, --null
              end each output line with 0 byte rather than newline

       -u, --unset=NAME
              remove variable from the environment

       --help display this help and exit

       --version
              output version information and exit

       A mere - implies -i.  If no COMMAND, print the resulting environment.
