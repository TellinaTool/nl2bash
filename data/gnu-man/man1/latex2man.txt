LATEX2MAN(1)                                    Documentation Tools                                     LATEX2MAN(1)



NAME
       Latex2man  is  a  tool  to translate UNIX manual pages written with LaTeXinto a format understood by the UNIX
       man(1)-command.  Alternatively HTML, TexInfo, or LaTeX code can be produced too.  Output of parts of the text
       may be suppressed using the conditional text feature (for this, LaTeX generation may be used).

SYNOPSIS
       latex2man [-ttransfile] [-cCSSfile] [-HMTL] [-h] [-V] [-Cname] [-achar] infile outfile

DESCRIPTION
       Latex2man  reads  the file infile and writes outfile.  The input must be a LaTeX document using the latex2man
       LaTeXpackage.  Latex2man translates that document into the troff(1) format using the -man macro package.

       Using the -H option, HTML code can be produced, instead of troff(1).  With this option you  can,  optionally,
       specify  a  CSSfile as an argument.  CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) allows you to control the appearance of the
       resulting HTML page.  See below for the names  of  CSS  classes  that  are  included  in  the  HTML  tags  as
       attributes.

       Using the -T option, TexInfo code can be produced, instead of troff(1).

       Using the -M option, troff(1) input is produced.

       Using the -L option, LaTeX ouput can be produced, instead of troff(1).

OPTIONS
       -ttransfile
               Translation for user defined LaTeX macros.

       -cCSSfile
               If  you  use  the  -H you can also specify a file that contains CSS style sheets. The link to the CSS
              file is inserted into the generatedHTML output using the specified CSSfile filename.

       -M
               Produce output suitable for the man(1) command (default).

       -H
               Instead of producing output suitable for the man(1) command, HTML code is produced (despite the  name
              of the command).

       -T
               Instead  of  producing  output suitable for the man(1) command, TexInfo code is produced (despite the
              name of the command). The generated .texi-file may  be  processed  with  makeinfo(1)  (to  produce  an
              .info-file)  which  in  turn  may  be installed using install-info(1).  The Info tags @dircategory and
              @direntry are provided.

       -L
               The LaTeX source is written to the outfile.  This is useful in conjunction with the -Cname option.

       -Cname
               Output the conditional text for name.  If more than one name should be  given  use  quotes:  -C'name1
              name2 ...'
              The following names are defined automatically:

              *      -H defines HTML

              *      -T defines TEXI

              *      -M defines MAN

              *      -L defines LATEX

       -achar
               Is used only in conjunction with -T.
              Background:
              TexInfo  ignores  all  blanks before the first word on a new line. In order to produce some additional
              space before that word (using \SP) some character has to be printed before the  additional  space.  By
              default  this is a . (dot). The char specifies an alternative for that first character. Giving a blank
              to -a supresses the indentation of a line.
              Note: only for the first \SP of a series that char is printed.

       -h
               Show a help text.

       -V
               Show version information.

LaTeX COMMANDS
       The LaTeX package latex2man is used to write the Man-pages with LaTeX.Since we translate into other text for‐
       mats, not all LaTeX stuff can be translated.

   PACKAGE OPTIONS
       The latex2man package accepts the following options:

       fancy  use the LaTeX package fancyheadings.

       fancyhdr
              use the LaTeX package fancyhdr.

       nofancy
              neither the LaTeX package fancyheadings nor fancyhdr are used.

       The default option may be specified in the file latex2man.cfg.

   PACKAGE SPECIFIC ENVIRONMENTS
       The following environments are provided by the package:

       \begin{Name}{chapter}{name}{author}{info}{title}
              The  Name environment takes five arguments: 1.  the Man-page chapter, 2.  the name of the Man-page, 3.
              the author, 4.  some short information about the tool printed in the footline of the Man-page, and  5.
              a text which is used as title, for HTML and LaTeX (it's ignored for output of the Man-page or TeXinfo.
              The Name environment must be the first environment in the document. Processing starts with this  envi‐
              ronment.  Any text before this is ignored (exception: the setVersion and setDate commands). (Note: all
              arguments of \begin{Name} must be written on one line).

       \begin{Table}[width]{columns}
              The Table environment takes two arguments: the first optional one specifies a width of the  last  col‐
              umn, the second one gives the number of columns.  For example:

       \begin{Table}[2cm]{3}
       Here & am & I \\\hline
       A 1 & A 2 & A 3 1 2 3 4 5 A 3 1 2 3 4 5 \\
       B 1 & B 2 & B 3 \\
       \end{Table}

       will be typeset as:

       Here   am    I
       ──────────────────────
       A 1    A 2   A  3 1 2
                    3 4 5  A
                    3  1 2 3
                    4 5
       B 1    B 2   B 3

       If no optional width argument is given, all entries are typeset left justified.  The width is a  length  mea‐
       sured absolutly in cm.  Processing with LaTeX a p{width} column is typeset as last column. The translation to
       troff(1) commands results in a lw(width) column specification. Translating to HTML and  TexInfo  ignores  the
       width parameter.

       \hline may be used.

       If  the  Man-page  is  formatted with troff(1) and tables are used, the tbl(1) preprocessor should be called,
       usually by giving a -t to the call of troff(1).  When viewing the generated manula page using man(1),  tbl(1)
       is called automatically.

       \begin{Description}
              is the same as \begin{description}

       \begin{Description}[label]
              is similar to \begin{description}, but the item labels have at minimum the size of the (optional) word
              label.  The difference is visible only in the DVI and PDF-output, not in the troff,  TexInfo  or  HTML
              output.

              a      |a \begin{description}

              ab     |ab

              abc    |abc

              a      |a \begin{Description}

              ab     |ab

              abc    |abc

              a      |a \begin{Description}[aa]

              ab     |ab

              abc    |abc

   ACCEPTED LaTeX ENVIRONMENTS
       The following environments are accepted:

       *      description

       *      enumerate

       *      itemize

              eral sections.  Usually there are the following sections in a  Man-page:  Name  (special  handling  as
              environment,  c.f.   above), Synopsis, Description, Options, Files, See Also, Diagnostics, Return Val‐
              ues, Bugs, Author, version, etc.

       \today 22 December 2010(see also the rcsinfo LaTeXpackage).

       \ss,\"a, ...
              \ss = ß, \"a= ä, \"o= ö, \"u= ü, \"A= Ä, \"O= Ö, \"U= Ü. It is allowed to surround these macros  in  {
              and } in all places, even inside other macros, e.g.
                   \textbf{\"a\"o\"u\"A\"O\"U\ss}
                   \textbf{\"a}{\"o}{\"u}{\"A}{\"O}{\"U}{\ss}}
                   \textbf{äöüÄÖÜß}


       äöüÄÖÜß äöüÄÖÜß äöüÄÖÜß

       If  these  letters  are used in their LATIN-1 8-bit coding, they are translated into the equivalent letter of
       the desired output format.  E.g. Ä becomes &Auml; in HTML and @"A in texinfo.

   CONDITIONAL TEXT
       latex2man preprocesses the LaTeX input to allow text to be used conditionally. A special sort of  LaTeX  com‐
       ment is used for that purpose.

       *      %@% IF condition %@%

       *      %@% ELSE %@%

       *      %@% END-IF %@%

       A  line  must  contain  only  such  a  comment and nothing else. condition is a boolean expression containing
       ``names'' and operators. The names given with the -Cname option have the  value  ``true'',  while  all  other
       names  occuring  in  the  expression are assumed to be ``false''. If the evaluation of the boolean expression
       results in the value ``true'', the  text  in  the  ``then''-part  is  used  and  the  text  in  the  optional
       ``else''-part is skipped (and vice versa). The IF/ELSE/END-IF may be nested. As boolean operators the follow‐
       ing are allowed:

       ( and ) for grouping are allowed.

       For example:
       %@% IF abc %@%
       abc set
       %@%  IF xyz %@%
       xyz set
       %@%  ELSE %@%
       xyz NOT set
       %@%  END-IF %@%
       %@% ELSE %@%
       abc NOT set
       %@%  IF xyz || !XYZ %@%
       xyz OR !XYZ set
       %@%  ELSE %@%
       xyz OR !XYZ NOT set
       %@%  END-IF %@%
       %@% END-IF %@%

       Run this manual page through latex2man with e.g.  -C'abc XYZ' and have a look to the generated  output.   (If
       simply running the LaTeX-document through LaTeX,all lines are shown in the .dvi file).
       abc NOT set
       xyz OR !XYZ set

       To check the conditional text feature, when latex2man is called with

       -CHTML
               the lines 1a, 2b, 3b, and 4b;

       -CTEXI
               the lines 1b, 2a, 3b, and 4b;

       -CMAN
               the lines 1b, 2b, 3a, and 4b;

       -CLATEX
               the lines 1b, 2b, 3b, and 4a;

       calling LaTeX without preprocessing
              all lines

       should be shown:

       1b. The HTML conditional was not set.

       2b. The TEXI conditional was not set.

       3a. This text occurs only when viewing the MAN output

       4b. The LATEX conditional was not set.

   TRANSLATION OF USER DEFINED MACROS
       The  user  macro translation file (given by the [-ttransfile]) contains Perl commands specifying the transla‐
       tion of LaTeX macros defined by the user. These macros may have none, one or  two  arguments.  The  following
       code is expected:

       *      Comments start with a # up to the end of the line.

       *      For a macro \foo with no arguments, the following code must be specified:

              Translation to Man-Pages
                     $manMacro{'foo'} = '...';

              Translation to HTML
                     $htmlMacro{'foo'} = '...';

              Translation to TexInfo
                     $texiMacro{'foo'} = '...';

              where ... is the translation.

       *      For a macro \foo{..} with one argument, the following code must be specified:

              Translation to Man-Pages
                     $manMacro1a{'foo'} = '...';
                     $manMacro1b{'foo'} = '...';

              Translation to HTML

                     $texiMacro1b{'foo'} = '...';

              where  ...  is the translation. The 1a code is used before the argument, while 1b is typeset after the
              argument is set.

       *      For a macro \foo{..}{..} with two arguments, the following code must be specified:

              Translation to Man-Pages
                     $manMacro2a{'foo'} = '...';
                     $manMacro2b{'foo'} = '...';
                     $manMacro2c{'foo'} = '...';

              Translation to HTML

                     $texiMacro2b{'foo'} = '...';
                     $texiMacro2c{'foo'} = '...';

              where ... is the translation. The 2a code is used before the first argument, 2b between the two  argu‐
              ments and 2c is typeset after the second argument is set.

   GENERAL REMARKS
       1.     Empty lines are typeset as paragraph separators.

       2.     The arguments of the LaTeX commands must not be split over several lines.

       3.     Do not nest calls to macros.

       4.     Except  the  mentioned environment and macros, the usage of other LaTeX environments or macros are not
              translated. Their usage will cause garbage in the output.

       5.     latex2man requires Perl version >= 5.0004_03.

       6.     If you want to install the system with the distributed Makefile, you need GNU-make.  If you don't have
              it, you should execute the steps shown in the Makefile manually.

SOME BUG FIX TESTS
       Leading . and '
              Now  leading  .  and ' in generation troff output should work propperly, since a \& is added. Therfore
              the \Dot macro has been deleted.
              Thanks to Frank.Schilder@Mathematik.Tu-Ilmenau.De.
