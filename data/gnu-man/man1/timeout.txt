NAME
       timeout - run a command with a time limit

SYNOPSIS
       timeout [OPTION] DURATION COMMAND [ARG]...
       timeout [OPTION]

DESCRIPTION
       Start COMMAND, and kill it if still running after DURATION.

       Mandatory arguments to long options are mandatory for short options too.

       --preserve-status

              exit with the same status as COMMAND, even when the command times out

       --foreground

              When  not running timeout directly from a shell prompt, allow COMMAND to read from the TTY and receive
              TTY signals.  In this mode, children of COMMAND will not be timed out.

       -k, --kill-after=DURATION

              also send a KILL signal if COMMAND is still running this long after the initial signal was sent.

       -s, --signal=SIGNAL

              specify the signal to be sent on timeout.  SIGNAL may be a name like 'HUP' or a number.  See 'kill -l'
              for a list of signals

       --help
              display this help and exit

       --version
              output version information and exit

       DURATION  is a floating point number with an optional suffix: 's' for seconds (the default), 'm' for minutes,
       'h' for hours or 'd' for days.

       If the command times out, and --preserve-status is not set, then exit with status 124.  Otherwise, exit  with
       the  status of COMMAND.  If no signal is specified, send the TERM signal upon timeout.  The TERM signal kills
       any process that does not block or catch that signal.  It may be necessary to use the KILL (9) signal,  since
       this signal cannot be caught, in which case the exit status is 128+9 rather than 124.

BUGS
       Some platforms don't curently support timeouts beyond 2038
