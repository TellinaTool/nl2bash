NAME
       ppmflash - brighten a picture up to complete white-out

SYNOPSIS
       ppmflash flashfactor [ppmfile]

DESCRIPTION
       Reads  a portable pixmap as input. Increases its brightness by the specified flashfactor up to a total white-
       out image.  The flashfactor may be in the range from 0.0 (original picture's brightness) to 1.0 (full  white-
       out, The Second After).

       As pnmgamma does not do the brightness correction in the way I wanted it, this small program was written.

       This program is similar to ppmbrighten , but not exactly the same.
