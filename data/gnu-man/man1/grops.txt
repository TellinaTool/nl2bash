NAME
       grops - PostScript driver for groff

SYNOPSIS
       grops [-glmv] [-b n] [-c n] [-F dir] [-I dir] [-p papersize] [-P prologue] [-w n] [files ...]

DESCRIPTION
       grops  translates the output of GNU troff to PostScript.  Normally grops should be invoked by using the groff
       command with a -Tps option.  (Actually, this is the default for groff.)  If no files are given,  grops  reads
       the  standard  input.   A  filename  of - also causes grops to read the standard input.  PostScript output is
       written to the standard output.  When grops is run by groff options can be passed to grops using  groff's  -P
       option.

       Note  that  grops  doesn't produce a valid document structure (conforming to the Document Structuring Conven‐
       tion) if called with multiple file arguments.  To print such concatenated output it is necessary  to  deacti‐
       vate  DSC handling in the printing program or previewer.  See section FONT INSTALLATION below for a guide how
       to install fonts for grops.

OPTIONS
       It is possible to have whitespace between a command line option and its parameter.

       -bn    Provide workarounds for older printers, broken spoolers, and previewers.  Normally grops produces out‐
              put  at  PostScript LanguageLevel 2 that conforms to the Document Structuring Conventions version 3.0.
              Some older printers, spoolers, and previewers can't handle such output.  The value of n controls  what
              grops  does  to  make its output acceptable to such programs.  A value of 0 causes grops not to employ
              any workarounds.

              Add 1 if no %%BeginDocumentSetup and %%EndDocumentSetup comments should be generated; this  is  needed
              for early versions of TranScript that get confused by anything between the %%EndProlog comment and the
              first %%Page comment.

              Add 2 if lines in included files beginning with %! should be stripped out; this is  needed  for  Sun's
              pageview previewer.

              Add  4 if %%Page, %%Trailer and %%EndProlog comments should be stripped out of included files; this is
              needed for spoolers that don't understand the %%BeginDocument and %%EndDocument comments.

              Add 8 if the first line of the PostScript output should be %!PS-Adobe-2.0 rather than  %!PS-Adobe-3.0;
              this is needed when using Sun's Newsprint with a printer that requires page reversal.

              Add  16  if  no  media  size  information  should  be  included  in the document (this is, neither use
              %%DocumentMedia nor the setpagedevice PostScript command).  This was the behaviour  of  groff  version
              1.18.1 and earlier; it is needed for older printers which don't understand PostScript LanguageLevel 2.
              It is also necessary if the output is further processed to get an encapsulated PS  (EPS)  file  –  see
              below.

              The default value can be specified by a

                     broken n

              command in the DESC file.  Otherwise the default value is 0.

       -cn    Print n copies of each page.

       -Fdir  Prepend  directory  dir/devname  to  the search path for prologue, font, and device description files;
              name is the name of the device, usually ps.

       -g     Guess the page length.  This generates PostScript code that guesses the page  length.   The  guess  is
              correct only if the imageable area is vertically centered on the page.  This option allows you to gen‐
              erate documents that can be printed both on letter (8.5×11) paper and on A4 paper without change.

       -Idir  This option may be used to add a directory to the search path for files on the command line and  files
              named  in  \X'ps:  import'  and \X'ps: file' escapes.  The search path is initialized with the current
              directory.  This option may be specified more than once; the directories  are  then  searched  in  the
              order specified (but before the current directory).  If you want to make the current directory be read
              before other directories, add -I. at the appropriate place.

              No directory search is performed for files with an absolute file name.

       -l     Print the document in landscape format.

       -m     Turn manual feed on for the document.

       -ppaper-size
              Set physical dimension of output medium.  This overrides the papersize,  paperlength,  and  paperwidth
              commands in the DESC file; it accepts the same arguments as the papersize command.  See groff_font (5)
              for details.

       -Pprologue-file
              Use the file prologue-file (in the font path) as the prologue instead of  the  default  prologue  file
              prologue.  This option overrides the environment variable GROPS_PROLOGUE.

       -wn    Lines  should  be drawn using a thickness of n thousandths of an em.  If this option is not given, the
              line thickness defaults to 0.04 em.

       -v     Print the version number.

USAGE
       The input to grops must be in the format output by troff(1).  This is described in groff_out(5).

       In addition, the device and font description files for the device used must meet  certain  requirements:  The
       resolution  must  be an integer multiple of 72 times the sizescale.  The ps device uses a resolution of 72000
       and a sizescale of 1000.

       The device description file must contain a valid paper size; see groff_font(5) for more information.

       Each font description file must contain a command

              internalname psname

       which says that the PostScript name of the font is psname.  It may also contain a command

              encoding enc_file

       which says that the PostScript font should be reencoded using the encoding described in enc_file;  this  file
       should consist of a sequence of lines of the form:

              pschar code

       where pschar is the PostScript name of the character, and code is its position in the encoding expressed as a
       decimal integer; valid values are in the range 0 to 255.  Lines starting with # and blank lines are  ignored.
       The  code for each character given in the font file must correspond to the code for the character in encoding
       file, or to the code in the default encoding for the font if the PostScript font  is  not  to  be  reencoded.
       This  code  can  be  used with the \N escape sequence in troff to select the character, even if the character
       does not have a groff name.  Every character in the font file must exist in  the  PostScript  font,  and  the
       widths  given in the font file must match the widths used in the PostScript font.  grops assumes that a char‐
       acter with a groff name of space is blank (makes no marks on the page); it can make use of such  a  character
       to generate more efficient and compact PostScript output.

       Note  that  grops is able to display all glyphs in a PostScript font, not only 256.  enc_file (or the default
       encoding if no encoding file specified) just defines the order of glyphs for the first  256  characters;  all
       other glyphs are accessed with additional encoding vectors which grops produces on the fly.

       grops  can  automatically include the downloadable fonts necessary to print the document.  Such fonts must be
       in PFA format.  Use pfbtops(1) to convert a Type 1 font in PFB format.  Any downloadable fonts which  should,
       when  required,  be included by grops must be listed in the file /usr/share/groff/1.22.2/font/devps/download;
       this should consist of lines of the form

              font filename

       where font is the PostScript name of the font, and filename is the name of  the  file  containing  the  font;
       lines  beginning  with  # and blank lines are ignored; fields may be separated by tabs or spaces; filename is
       searched for using the same mechanism that is used for groff font metric files.  The download file itself  is
       also searched for using this mechanism; currently, only the first found file in the font path is used.

       If  the  file  containing a downloadable font or imported document conforms to the Adobe Document Structuring
       Conventions, then grops interprets any comments in the files sufficiently to ensure that its  own  output  is
       conforming.   It  also supplies any needed font resources that are listed in the download file as well as any
       needed file resources.  It is also able to handle inter-resource dependencies.  For example, suppose that you
       have  a downloadable font called Garamond, and also a downloadable font called Garamond-Outline which depends
       on Garamond (typically it would be defined to copy Garamond's font dictionary,  and  change  the  PaintType),
       then  it  is necessary for Garamond to appear before Garamond-Outline in the PostScript document.  grops han‐
       dles this automatically provided that the downloadable font file for Garamond-Outline  indicates  its  depen‐
       dence on Garamond by means of the Document Structuring Conventions, for example by beginning with the follow‐
       ing lines

              %!PS-Adobe-3.0 Resource-Font
              %%DocumentNeededResources: font Garamond
              %%EndComments
              %%IncludeResource: font Garamond

       In this case both Garamond and Garamond-Outline would need to be listed in the download file.  A downloadable
       font should not include its own name in a %%DocumentSuppliedResources comment.

       grops  does  not  interpret  %%DocumentFonts  comments.   The  %%DocumentNeededResources, %%DocumentSupplied‐
       Resources, %%IncludeResource, %%BeginResource, and %%EndResource comments (or possibly  the  old  %%Document‐
       NeededFonts, %%DocumentSuppliedFonts, %%IncludeFont, %%BeginFont, and %%EndFont comments) should be used.

       In the default setup there are styles called R, I, B, and BI mounted at font positions 1 to 4.  The fonts are
       grouped into families A, BM, C, H, HN, N, P, and T having members in each of these styles:

              AR     AvantGarde-Book
              AI     AvantGarde-BookOblique
              AB     AvantGarde-Demi
              ABI    AvantGarde-DemiOblique
              BMR    Bookman-Light
              BMI    Bookman-LightItalic
              BMB    Bookman-Demi
              BMBI   Bookman-DemiItalic
              CR     Courier
              CI     Courier-Oblique
              CB     Courier-Bold
              CBI    Courier-BoldOblique
              HR     Helvetica
              HI     Helvetica-Oblique
              HB     Helvetica-Bold
              HBI    Helvetica-BoldOblique
              HNR    Helvetica-Narrow
              HNI    Helvetica-Narrow-Oblique
              HNB    Helvetica-Narrow-Bold
              HNBI   Helvetica-Narrow-BoldOblique
              NR     NewCenturySchlbk-Roman
              NI     NewCenturySchlbk-Italic
              NB     NewCenturySchlbk-Bold
              NBI    NewCenturySchlbk-BoldItalic
              PR     Palatino-Roman
              PI     Palatino-Italic
              PB     Palatino-Bold
              PBI    Palatino-BoldItalic
              TR     Times-Roman
              TI     Times-Italic
              TB     Times-Bold
              TBI    Times-BoldItalic

       There is also the following font which is not a member of a family:

              ZCMI   ZapfChancery-MediumItalic

       There are also some special fonts called S for the PS Symbol font, and SS, containing slanted lowercase Greek
       letters taken from PS Symbol.  Zapf Dingbats is available as ZD, and a reversed version of ZapfDingbats (with
       symbols pointing in the opposite direction) is available as ZDR; most characters in these fonts  are  unnamed
       and must be accessed using \N.

       The  default  color  for \m and \M is black; for colors defined in the `rgb' color space setrgbcolor is used,
       for `cmy' and `cmyk' setcmykcolor, and for `gray' setgray.  Note  that  setcmykcolor  is  a  PostScript  Lan‐
       guageLevel 2 command and thus not available on some older printers.

       grops  understands  various  X commands produced using the \X escape sequence; grops only interprets commands
       that begin with a ps: tag.

       \X'ps: exec code'
              This executes the arbitrary PostScript commands in code.  The PostScript currentpoint is  set  to  the
              position  of  the \X command before executing code.  The origin is at the top left corner of the page,
              and y coordinates increase down the page.  A procedure u is defined that converts groff units  to  the
              coordinate system in effect (provided the user doesn't change the scale).  For example,

                     .nr x 1i
                     \X'ps: exec \nx u 0 rlineto stroke'

              draws  a  horizontal line one inch long.  code may make changes to the graphics state, but any changes
              persist only to the end of the page.  A dictionary containing the definitions specified by the def and
              mdef  is on top of the dictionary stack.  If your code adds definitions to this dictionary, you should
              allocate space for them using \X'ps mdef n'.  Any definitions persist only until the end of the  page.
              If  you  use the \Y escape sequence with an argument that names a macro, code can extend over multiple
              lines.  For example,

                     .nr x 1i
                     .de y
                     ps: exec
                     \nx u 0 rlineto
                     stroke
                     ..
                     \Yy

              is another way to draw a horizontal line one inch long.  Note the single backslash before `nx'  –  the
              only  reason  to  use  a  number  register while defining the macro `y' is to convert a user-specified
              dimension `1i' to internal groff units which are in turn converted to PS units with the u procedure.

              grops wraps user-specified PostScript code into a dictionary, nothing more.  In particular, it doesn't
              start  and  end  the  inserted code with save and restore, respectively.  This must be supplied by the
              user, if necessary.

       \X'ps: file name'
              This is the same as the exec command except that the PostScript code is read from file name.

       \X'ps: def code'
              Place a PostScript definition contained in code in the prologue.  There should be at most one  defini‐
              tion  per  \X command.  Long definitions can be split over several \X commands; all the code arguments
              are simply joined together separated by newlines.  The definitions are placed in a dictionary which is
              automatically  pushed  on  the  dictionary  stack when an exec command is executed.  If you use the \Y
              escape sequence with an argument that names a macro, code can extend over multiple lines.

       \X'ps: mdef n code'
              Like def, except that code may contain up to n definitions.  grops needs to know how many  definitions
              code contains so that it can create an appropriately sized PostScript dictionary to contain them.

       \X'ps: import file llx lly urx ury width [ height ]'
              Import  a PostScript graphic from file.  The arguments llx, lly, urx, and ury give the bounding box of
              the graphic in the default PostScript coordinate system; they should all be integers; llx and lly  are
              the  x  and y coordinates of the lower left corner of the graphic; urx and ury are the x and y coordi‐
              nates of the upper right corner of the graphic; width and height are integers that  give  the  desired
              width and height in groff units of the graphic.

              The  graphic is scaled so that it has this width and height and translated so that the lower left cor‐
              ner of the graphic is located at the position associated with \X command.  If the height  argument  is
              omitted it is scaled uniformly in the x and y directions so that it has the specified width.

              Note  that  the  contents  of  the  \X command are not interpreted by troff; so vertical space for the
              graphic is not automatically added, and the width  and  height  arguments  are  not  allowed  to  have
              attached scaling indicators.

              If  the  PostScript  file  complies  with  the  Adobe  Document Structuring Conventions and contains a
              %%BoundingBox comment, then the bounding box can be automatically extracted from within groff by using
              the psbb request.

              See  groff_tmac(5)  for a description of the PSPIC macro which provides a convenient high-level inter‐
              face for inclusion of PostScript graphics.

       \X'ps: invis'
       \X'ps: endinvis'
              No output is generated for text and drawing commands that are bracketed with these \X commands.  These
              commands  are  intended for use when output from troff is previewed before being processed with grops;
              if the previewer is unable to display certain characters or other constructs,  then  other  substitute
              characters or constructs can be used for previewing by bracketing them with these \X commands.

              For  example,  gxditview is not able to display a proper \(em character because the standard X11 fonts
              do not provide it; this problem can be overcome by executing the following request

                     .char \(em \X'ps: invis'\
                     \Z'\v'-.25m'\h'.05m'\D'l .9m 0'\h'.05m''\
                     \X'ps: endinvis'\(em

              In this case, gxditview is unable to display the \(em character and  draws  the  line,  whereas  grops
              prints  the \(em character and ignores the line (this code is already in file Xps.tmac which is loaded
              if a document intended for grops is previewed with gxditview).

       If a PostScript procedure BPhook has been defined via a `ps: def' or `ps: mdef' device command,  it  is  exe‐
       cuted  at the beginning of every page (before anything is drawn or written by groff).  For example, to under‐
       lay the page contents with the word `DRAFT' in light gray, you might use

              .de XX
              ps: def
              /BPhook
              { gsave .9 setgray clippath pathbbox exch 2 copy
                .5 mul exch .5 mul translate atan rotate pop pop
                /NewCenturySchlbk-Roman findfont 200 scalefont setfont
                (DRAFT) dup stringwidth pop -.5 mul -70 moveto show
                grestore }
              def
              ..
              .devicem XX

       Or, to cause lines and polygons to be drawn with square linecaps and mitered linejoins instead of  the  round
       linecaps and linejoins normally used by grops, use

              .de XX
              ps: def
              /BPhook { 2 setlinecap 0 setlinejoin } def
              ..
              .devicem XX

       (square  linecaps,  as opposed to butt linecaps (0 setlinecap), give true corners in boxed tables even though
       the lines are drawn unconnected).

   Encapsulated PostScript
       grops itself doesn't emit bounding box information.  With  the  help  of  Ghostscript  the  following  simple
       script, groff2eps, produces an encapsulated PS file.

              #! /bin/sh
              groff -P-b16 $1 >$1.ps
              gs -dNOPAUSE -sDEVICE=bbox -- $1.ps 2>$1.bbox
              cat $1.ps \
              | sed -e "/^%%Orientation/r$1.bbox" \
                    -e "/^%!PS-Adobe-3.0/s/$/ EPSF-3.0/" >$1.eps
              rm $1.ps $1.bbox

       Just say

              groff2eps foo

       to convert file foo to foo.eps.

   TrueType and other font formats
       TrueType  fonts  can  be  used  with grops if converted first to Type 42 format, a special PostScript wrapper
       equivalent to the PFA format mentioned in pfbtops(1).  There are several  different  methods  to  generate  a
       type42 wrapper and most of them involve the use of a PostScript interpreter such as Ghostscript – see gs(1).

       Yet, the easiest method involves the use of the application ttftot42(1).  This program uses freetype(3) (ver‐
       sion 1.3.1) to generate type42 font wrappers and well-formed AFM files that can be  fed  to  the  afmtodit(1)
       script to create appropriate metric files.  The resulting font wrappers should be added to the download file.
       ttftot42 source code can be downloaded from ftp://www.giga.or.at/pub/nih/ttftot42/ ⟨ftp://www.giga.or.at/pub/
       nih/ttftot42/⟩.

       Another  solution  for  creating  type42 wrappers is to use FontForge, available from http://fontforge.sf.net
       ⟨http://fontforge.sf.net⟩.  This font editor can convert most outline font formats.

FONT INSTALLATION
       This section gives a summary of the above explanations; it can serve  as  a  step-by-step  font  installation
       guide for grops.

        ·  Convert  your font to something groff understands.  This is either a PostScript Type 1 font in PFA format
           or a PostScript Type 42 font, together with an AFM file.

           The very first characters in a PFA file look like this:

                  %!PS-AdobeFont-1.0:

           A PFB file has this also in the first line, but the string is preceded with some binary bytes.

           The very first characters in a Type 42 font file look like this:

                  %!PS-TrueTypeFont

           This is a wrapper format for TrueType fonts.  Old PS printers might not support it (this is,  they  don't
           have a built-in TrueType font interpreter).

           If  your  font  is  in  PFB format (such fonts normally have `.pfb' as the file extension), you might use
           groff's pfbtops(1) program to convert it to PFA.  For TrueType fonts, try ttftot42 or fontforge.  For all
           other font formats use fontforge which can convert most outline font formats.

        ·  Convert the AFM file to a groff font description file with the afmtodit(1) program.  An example call is

                  afmtodit Foo-Bar-Bold.afm textmap FBB

           which  converts  the  metric  file `Foo-Bar-Bold.afm' to the groff font `FBB'.  If you have a font family
           which comes with normal, bold, italic, and bold italic faces, it is recommended to use the letters R,  B,
           I,  and  BI,  respectively, as postfixes in the groff font names to make groff's `.fam' request work.  An
           example is groff's built-in Times-Roman font: The font family name is T, and the groff font names are TR,
           TB, TI, and TBI.

        ·  Install  both  the  groff font description files and the fonts in a `devps' subdirectory of the font path
           which groff finds.  See the ENVIRONMENT section in the troff(1) man page which lists the actual value  of
           the font path.  Note that groff doesn't use the AFM files (but it is a good idea to store them anyway).

        ·  Register  all fonts which must be downloaded to the printer in the `devps/download' file.  Only the first
           occurrence of this file in the font path is read.  This means that you should copy the default `download'
           file to the first directory in your font path and add your fonts there.  To continue the above example we
           assume that the PS font name for Foo-Bar-Bold.pfa is `XY-Foo-Bar-Bold' (the PS font name is stored in the
           internalname field in the `FBB' file), thus the following line should be added to `download'.

                  XY-Foo-Bar-Bold Foo-Bar-Bold.pfa

OLD FONTS
       groff versions 1.19.2 and earlier contain a slightly different set of the 35 Adobe core fonts; the difference
       is mainly the lack of the `Euro' glyph and a reduced set of  kerning  pairs.   For  backwards  compatibility,
       these old fonts are installed also in the

              /usr/share/groff/1.22.2/oldfont/devps

       directory.

       To  use  them,  make  sure  that grops finds the fonts before the default system fonts (with the same names):
       Either add command line option -F to grops

              groff -Tps -P-F -P/usr/share/groff/1.22.2/oldfont ...

       or add the directory to groff's font path environment variable

              GROFF_FONT_PATH=/usr/share/groff/1.22.2/oldfont

ENVIRONMENT
       GROPS_PROLOGUE
              If this is set to foo, then grops uses the file foo (in the font path) instead of the default prologue
              file prologue.  The option -P overrides this environment variable.

       GROFF_FONT_PATH
              A  list  of  directories in which to search for the devname directory in addition to the default ones.
              See troff(1) and groff_font(5) for more details.
