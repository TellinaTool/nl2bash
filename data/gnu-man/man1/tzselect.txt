TZSELECT(1)                                 Debian Timezone Configuration                                TZSELECT(1)



NAME
       tzselect - view timezones

SYNOPSIS
       tzselect

DESCRIPTION
       This manual page explains how you can use the tzselect utility to view the installed timezone. It comes handy
       when you want to know what time it is in other countries, or if you just wonder what timezones exist.

       tzselect is called without any parameters from the shell. It shows a list of about one dozen geographic areas
       one  can roughly recognize as continents. After choosing a geographic area by number, a list of countries and
       cities in this area will be shown.

       You can press the Enter key to reprint the list. To choose a timezone, just press the number left to it.   If
       your input is invalid, the list will be reprinted.

       You may press Ctrl-C to interrupt the script at any time.

       Note  that  tzselect  will not actually change the timezone for you. Use 'dpkg-reconfigure tzdata' to achieve
       this.
