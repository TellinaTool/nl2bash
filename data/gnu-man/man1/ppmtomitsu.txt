NAME
       ppmtomitsu - convert a portable pixmap to a Mitsubishi S340-10 file

SYNOPSIS
       ppmtomitsu [-sharpness val] [-enlarge val] [-media string] [-copy val] [-dpi300] [-tiny] [ppmfile]

DESCRIPTION
       Reads a portable pixmap as input and converts it into a format suitable to be printed by a Mitsubishi S340-10
       printer, or any other Mitsubishi color sublimation printer.

       The Mitsubishi S340-10 Color Sublimation printer supports 24bit color.  Images of the available sizes take so
       long to transfer that there is a fast method, employing a lookuptable, that ppmtomitsu will use if there is a
       maximum of 256 colors in the pixmap.  ppmtomitsu will try to position your image to the center of the  paper,
       and  will  rotate  your  image for you if xsize is larger than ysize.  If your image is larger than the media
       allows, ppmtomitsu will quit with an error message. (We decided that the media were  too  expensive  to  have
       careless  users  produce  misprints.)  Once data transmission has started, the job can't be stopped in a sane
       way without resetting the printer.  The printer understands putting together images in the  printers  memory;
       ppmtomitsu  doesn't utilize this as pnmcat etc provide the same functionality and let you view the result on-
       screen, too.  The S340-10 is the lowest common denominator printer; for higher  resolution  printers  there's
       the  dpi300  option.  The  other printers also support higher values for enlarge eg, but I don't think that's
       essential enough to warrant a change in the program.

       -sharpness 1-4
               'sharpness' designation. Default is to use the current sharpness.

       -enlarge 1-3
              Enlarge by a factor; Default is 1 (no enlarge)

       -media A, A4, AS, A4S
              Designate the media you're using. Default is 1184 x 1350, which will fit on any media.  A  is  1216  x
              1350, A4 is 1184 x 1452, AS is 1216 x 1650 and A4S is 1184 x 1754. A warning: If you specify a differ‐
              ent media than the printer currently has, the printer will wait until you put in the correct media  or
              switch it off.

       -copy 1-9
              The number of copies to produce. Default is 1.

       -dpi300
              Double  the  number  of  allowed  pixels  for  a  S3600-30 Printer in S340-10 compatibility mode. (The
              S3600-30 has 300 dpi).

       -tiny  Memory-safing, but always slow. The printer will get the data line-by-line in 24bit. It's  probably  a
              good idea to use this if your machine starts paging a lot without this option.
