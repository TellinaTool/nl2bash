XINIT(1)                                       General Commands Manual                                      XINIT(1)



NAME
       xinit - X Window System initializer

SYNOPSIS
       xinit [ [ client ] options ... ] [ -- [ server ] [ display ] options ... ]

DESCRIPTION
       The  xinit program is used to start the X Window System server and a first client program on systems that are
       not using a display manager such as xdm(1) or in environments that use multiple window  systems.   When  this
       first client exits, xinit will kill the X server and then terminate.

       If  no  specific  client  program is given on the command line, xinit will look for a file in the user's home
       directory called .xinitrc to run as a shell script to start up client programs.   If  no  such  file  exists,
       xinit will use the following as a default:

            xterm  -geometry  +1+1  -n  login  -display  :0


       If  no  specific  server  program is given on the command line, xinit will look for a file in the user's home
       directory called .xserverrc to run as a shell script to start up the server.  If no such file  exists,  xinit
       will use the following as a default:

            X  :0

       Note  that  this  assumes that there is a program named X in the current search path.  The site administrator
       should, therefore, make a link to the appropriate type of server on the machine, or  create  a  shell  script
       that runs xinit with the appropriate server.

       Note,  when using a .xserverrc script be sure to ``exec'' the real X server.  Failing to do this can make the
       X server slow to start and exit.  For example:

            exec Xdisplaytype

       An important point is that programs which are run by .xinitrc should be run in the background if they do  not
       exit  right  away,  so that they don't prevent other programs from starting up.  However, the last long-lived
       program started (usually a window manager or terminal emulator) should be left in the foreground so that  the
       script won't exit (which indicates that the user is done and that xinit should exit).

       An  alternate  client and/or server may be specified on the command line.  The desired client program and its
       arguments should be given as the first command line arguments to xinit.  To specify a particular server  com‐
       mand  line,  append a double dash (--) to the xinit command line (after any client and arguments) followed by
       the desired server command.

       Both the client program name and the server program name must begin with a slash (/) or a period (.).  Other‐
       wise,  they are treated as an arguments to be appended to their respective startup lines.  This makes it pos‐
       sible to add arguments (for example, foreground and background colors) without having  to  retype  the  whole
       command line.

       If an explicit server name is not given and the first argument following the double dash (--) is a colon fol‐
       lowed by a digit, xinit will use that number as the display number instead of zero.  All remaining  arguments
       are appended to the server command line.

EXAMPLES
       Below are several examples of how command line arguments in xinit are used.

       xinit   This  will  start  up  a  server  named X and run the user's .xinitrc, if it exists, or else start an
               xterm.

       xinit -- /usr/local/bin/Xvnc  :1
               This is how one could start a specific type of server on an alternate display.

       xinit -geometry =80x65+10+10 -fn 8x13 -j -fg white -bg navy
               This will start up a server named X, and will append the given arguments to the  default  xterm  com‐
               mand.  It will ignore .xinitrc.

       xinit -e widgets -- ./Xorg -l -c
               This will use the command .Xorg -l -c to start the server and will append the arguments -e widgets to
               the default xterm command.

       xinit /usr/ucb/rsh fasthost cpupig -display ws:1 --  :1 -a 2 -t 5
               This will start a server named X on display 1 with the arguments -a 2 -t 5.  It  will  then  start  a
               remote  shell  on the machine fasthost in which it will run the command cpupig, telling it to display
               back on the local workstation.

       Below is a sample .xinitrc that starts a clock, several terminals, and leaves the window manager  running  as
       the  ``last''  application.   Assuming  that  the  window manager has been configured properly, the user then
       chooses the ``Exit'' menu item to shut down X.

               xrdb -load $HOME/.Xresources
               xsetroot -solid gray &
               xclock -g 50x50-0+0 -bw 0 &
               xload -g 50x50-50+0 -bw 0 &
               xterm -g 80x24+0+0 &
               xterm -g 80x24+0-0 &
               twm

       Sites that want to create a common startup environment could simply create a default .xinitrc that references
       a site-wide startup file:

               #!/bin/sh
               . /usr/local/lib/site.xinitrc

       Another  approach is to write a script that starts xinit with a specific shell script.  Such scripts are usu‐
       ally named x11, xstart, or startx and are a convenient way to provide a simple interface for novice users:

               #!/bin/sh
               xinit /usr/local/lib/site.xinitrc -- /usr/bin/X -br


ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES
       DISPLAY        This variable gets set to the name of the display to which clients should connect.

       XINITRC        This variable specifies an init file containing shell commands to start up  the  initial  win‐
                      dows.  By default, .xinitrc in the home directory will be used.

FILES
       .xinitrc       default client script

       xterm          client to run if .xinitrc does not exist

       .xserverrc     default server script

       X              server to run if .xserverrc does not exist
