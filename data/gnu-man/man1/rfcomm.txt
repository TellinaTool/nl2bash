RFCOMM(1)                                                                                                  RFCOMM(1)



NAME
       rfcomm - RFCOMM configuration utility

SYNOPSIS
       rfcomm [ options ] < command > < dev >

DESCRIPTION
       rfcomm  is  used  to set up, maintain, and inspect the RFCOMM configuration of the Bluetooth subsystem in the
       Linux kernel. If no command is given, or if the option -a is used, rfcomm prints information about  the  con‐
       figured RFCOMM devices.

OPTIONS
       -h     Gives a list of possible commands.

       -a     Prints information about all configured RFCOMM devices.

       -r     Switch TTY into raw mode (doesn't work with "bind").

       -f <file>
              Specify alternate config file.

       -i <hciX> | <bdaddr>
              The  command  is applied to device -A Enable authentication.  -E Enable encryption.  -S Secure connec‐
              tion.  -M Become the master of a piconet.  hciX , which  must  be  the  name  or  the  address  of  an
              installed  Bluetooth  device.  If not specified, the command will be use the first available Bluetooth
              device.

       -A     Enable authentification

       -E     Enable encryption

       -S     Secure connection

       -M     Become the master of a piconet

       -L <seconds>
              Set linger timeout

COMMANDS
       show <dev>
              Display the information about the specified device.

       connect <dev> [bdaddr] [channel]
              Connect the RFCOMM device to the remote Bluetooth device on the specified channel. If  no  channel  is
              specified,  it  will  use the channel number 1. If also the Bluetooth address is left out, it tries to
              read the data from the config file. This command can be terminated with the key sequence CTRL-C.

       listen <dev> [channel] [cmd]
              Listen on a specified RFCOMM channel for incoming connections.  If no channel is  specified,  it  will
              use the channel number 1, but a channel must be specified before cmd. If cmd is given, it will be exe‐
              cuted as soon as a client connects. When the child process terminates or the  client  disconnect,  the
              command  will  terminate.  Occurrences of {} in cmd will be replaced by the name of the device used by
              the connection. This command can be terminated with the key sequence CTRL-C.

       watch <dev> [channel] [cmd]
              Watch is identical to listen except that when the child process terminates or the  client  disconnect,
              the command will restart listening with the same parameters.

       bind <dev> [bdaddr] [channel]
              This  binds the RFCOMM device to a remote Bluetooth device. The command did not establish a connection
              to the remote device, it only creates the binding. The connection will be established right  after  an
              application  tries  to  open the RFCOMM device. If no channel number is specified, it uses the channel
              number 1. If the Bluetooth address is also left out, it tries to read the data from the config file.

              If all is specified for the RFCOMM device, then all devices that have bind yes set in the config  will
              be bound.

       release <dev>
              This command releases a defined RFCOMM binding.

              If  all  is  specified  for the RFCOMM device, then all bindings will be removed.  This command didn't
              care about the settings in the config file.
