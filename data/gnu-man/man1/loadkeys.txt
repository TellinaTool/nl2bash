LOADKEYS(1)                                    General Commands Manual                                   LOADKEYS(1)



NAME
       loadkeys - load keyboard translation tables

SYNOPSIS
       loadkeys  [  -b  --bkeymap  ]  [ -c --clearcompose ] [ -C '<FILE>' | --console=<FILE> ] [ -d --default ] [ -h
       --help ] [ -m --mktable ] [ -q --quiet ] [ -s --clearstrings ] [ -u --unicode ] [  -v  --verbose  ]  [  file‐
       name...  ]

DESCRIPTION
       The  program loadkeys reads the file or files specified by filename....  Its main purpose is to load the ker‐
       nel keymap for the console.  You can specify console device by the -C (or --console ) option.

RESET TO DEFAULT
       If the -d (or --default ) option is given, loadkeys loads a default keymap, probably the  file  defkeymap.map
       either in /usr/share/keymaps or in /usr/src/linux/drivers/char.  (Probably the former was user-defined, while
       the latter is a qwerty keyboard map for PCs - maybe not what was desired.)  Sometimes, with a strange  keymap
       loaded  (with  the  minus  on  some  obscure  unknown  modifier  combination)  it is easier to type `loadkeys
       defkeymap'.

LOAD KERNEL KEYMAP
       The main function of loadkeys is to load or modify the keyboard driver's translation tables.  When specifying
       the file names, standard input can be denoted by dash (-). If no file is specified, the data is read from the
       standard input.

       For many countries and keyboard types appropriate keymaps are available already, and a command like `loadkeys
       uk' might do what you want. On the other hand, it is easy to construct one's own keymap. The user has to tell
       what symbols belong to each key. She can find the keycode for a key by use of showkey(1),  while  the  keymap
       format is given in keymaps(5) and can also be seen from the output of dumpkeys(1).

LOAD KERNEL ACCENT TABLE
       If  the  input  file does not contain any compose key definitions, the kernel accent table is left unchanged,
       unless the -c (or --clearcompose ) option is given, in which case the kernel accent table is emptied.  If the
       input  file  does  contain compose key definitions, then all old definitions are removed, and replaced by the
       specified new entries.  The kernel accent table is a sequence of (by default 68) entries describing how  dead
       diacritical signs and compose keys behave.  For example, a line

              compose ',' 'c' to ccedilla

       means  that  <ComposeKey><,><c> must be combined to <ccedilla>.  The current content of this table can be see
       using `dumpkeys --compose-only'.

LOAD KERNEL STRING TABLE
       The option -s (or --clearstrings ) clears the kernel string table. If this option is not given, loadkeys will
       only  add  or  replace  strings,  not  remove them.  (Thus, the option -s is required to reach a well-defined
       state.)  The kernel string table is a sequence of strings with names like F31. One can make function  key  F5
       (on an ordinary PC keyboard) produce the text `Hello!', and Shift+F5 `Goodbye!' using lines

              keycode 63 = F70 F71
              string F70 = "Hello!"
              string F71 = "Goodbye!"

       in  the  keymap.   The default bindings for the function keys are certain escape sequences mostly inspired by
       the VT100 terminal.

CREATE KERNEL SOURCE TABLE
       If the -m (or --mktable ) option is given loadkeys prints to the standard output a file that may be  used  as
       /usr/src/linux/drivers/char/defkeymap.c,  specifying the default key bindings for a kernel (and does not mod‐
       ify the current keymap).

CREATE BINARY KEYMAP
       If the -b (or --bkeymap ) option is given loadkeys prints to the standard output a file that may be used as a
       binary keymap as expected by Busybox loadkmap command (and does not modify the current keymap).

UNICODE MODE
       loadkeys  automatically  detects  whether  the console is in Unicode or ASCII (XLATE) mode.  When a keymap is
       loaded, literal keysyms (such as section) are resolved accordingly; numerical keysyms are  converted  to  fit
       the current console mode, regardless of the way they are specified (decimal, octal, hexadecimal or Unicode).

       The -u (or --unicode) switch forces loadkeys to convert all keymaps to Unicode.  If the keyboard is in a non-
       Unicode mode, such as XLATE, loadkeys will change it to Unicode for the time of  its  execution.   A  warning
       message will be printed in this case.

       It is recommended to run kbd_mode(1) before loadkeys instead of using the -u option.

OTHER OPTIONS
       -h --help
              loadkeys prints its version number and a short usage message to the programs standard error output and
              exits.

       -q --quiet
              loadkeys suppresses all normal output.

WARNING
       Note that anyone having read access to /dev/console can run loadkeys and thus  change  the  keyboard  layout,
       possibly making it unusable. Note that the keyboard translation table is common for all the virtual consoles,
       so any changes to the keyboard bindings affect all the virtual consoles simultaneously.

       Note that because the changes affect all the virtual consoles, they also outlive  your  session.  This  means
       that even at the login prompt the key bindings may not be what the user expects.

FILES
       /usr/share/keymaps
              default directory for keymaps

       /usr/src/linux/drivers/char/defkeymap.map
              default kernel keymap
