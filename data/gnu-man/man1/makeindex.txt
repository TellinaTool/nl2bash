NAME
       makeindex - a general purpose, formatter-independent index processor

SYNOPSIS
       makeindex [-c] [-g] [-i] [-l] [-o ind] [-p num] [-q] [-r] [-s sfile] [-t log] [-L] [-T] [idx0 idx1 idx2...]

DESCRIPTION
       The  program  makeindex is a general purpose hierarchical index generator; it accepts one or more input files
       (often produced by a text formatter such as TeX (tex(1L)) or troff(1), sorts the  entries,  and  produces  an
       output  file which can be formatted.  The index can have up to three levels (0, 1, and 2) of subitem nesting.
       The way in which words are flagged for indexing within the main document is specific to the  formatter  used;
       makeindex  does  not  automate  the  process  of selecting these words.  As the output index is hierarchical,
       makeindex can be considered complimentary to the awk(1)-based make.index(1L) system of Bentley and Kernighan,
       which  is  specific  to  troff(1),  generates non-hierarchical indices, and employs a much simpler syntax for
       indicating index entries.  For illustration of use with troff and TeX, see the section EXAMPLES below.

       The formats of the input and output files are specified in a style file; by default, input is assumed to be a
       .idx file, as generated by LaTeX.

       Unless  specified  explicitly, the base name of the first input file (idx0) is used to determine the names of
       other files.  For each input file name specified, a file of that name is sought.  If this file is  not  found
       and  the  file  name  has  no extension, the extension .idx is appended.  If no file with this name is found,
       makeindex aborts.

       If exactly one input file was given and no explicit style file was specified using -s, makeindex uses a  file
       with the extension .mst as default style file (when present).

       For  important  notes  on how to select index keywords, see the document by Lamport cited below.  As an issue
       separate from selecting index keywords, a systematic mechanism for placing index terms in a document is  sug‐
       gested in Index Preparation and Processing, a paper cited below.

OPTIONS
       -c        Compress  intermediate  blanks (ignoring leading and trailing blanks and tabs).  By default, blanks
                 in the index key are retained.

       -g        Employ German word ordering in the index, in accord with rules set forth in DIN 5007.  By  default,
                 makeindex employs a word ordering in which precedence is: symbols, numbers, uppercase letters, low‐
                 ercase letters.  The sequence in German word ordering is:  symbols,  lowercase  letters,  uppercase
                 letters, numbers.  Additionally, this option enables makeindex to recognize the German TeX-commands
                 {"a, "o, "u and "s} as {ae, oe, ue and ss} during the sorting of the entries.  The quote  character
                 must  be redefined in a style file (for example, redefine quote as '+').  If the quote character is
                 not redefined, makeindex will produce an error message and abort.

       -i        Take input from stdin.  When this option is specified and -o is not, output is written to stdout.

       -l        Letter ordering; by default, word ordering is used (see the ORDERING section).

       -o ind    Employ ind as the output index file.  By default, the file name is created by appending the  exten‐
                 sion .ind to the base name of the first input file (idx0).

       -p num    Set  the  starting page number of the output index file to be num (useful when the index file is to
                 be formatted separately).  The argument num may be numerical or one of the following:

                 any       The starting page is the last source page number plus 1.

                 odd       The starting page is the first odd page following the last source page number.

                 even      The starting page is the first even page following the last source page number.

                 The last source page is obtained by searching backward in the log file for the first instance of  a
                 number included within paired square brackets ([...]).  If a page number is missing or the log file
                 is not found, no attempt will be made to set the starting page number.  The source log file name is
                 determined by appending the extension .log to the base name of the first input file (idx0).

       -q        Quiet mode; send no messages to stderr.  By default, progress and error messages are sent to stderr
                 as well as to the transcript file.

       -r        Disable implicit page range formation; page ranges must be created by using explicit  range  opera‐
                 tors;  see  SPECIAL  EFFECTS  below.   By default, three or more successive pages are automatically
                 abbreviated as a range (e.g. 1—5).

       -s sty    Employ sty as the style file (no default).  The environment variable INDEXSTYLE  defines  the  path
                 where the style file should be found.

       -t log    Employ log as the transcript file.  By default, the file name is created by appending the extension
                 .ilg to the base name of the first input file (idx0).

       -L        sort based on locale settings. Not available on all systems.

       -T        special support for Thai documents. Not available on all systems.

STYLE FILE
       The style file informs makeindex about the format of the .idx input files and  the  intended  format  of  the
       final  output file; examples appear below.  This file can reside anywhere in the path defined by the environ‐
       ment variable INDEXSTYLE.  The style file contains a list of <specifier, attribute>  pairs.   There  are  two
       types of specifiers: input and output.  Pairs do not have to appear in any particular order.  A line begun by
       `%' is a comment.  In the following list of specifiers and arguments, <string> is an arbitrary string  delim‐
       ited by double quotes ("..."), <char> is a single letter embraced by single quotes ('...'), and <number> is a
       nonnegative integer.  The maximum length of a <string> is 2048.  A literal backslash or quote must be escaped
       (by  a backslash).  Anything not specified in the style file will be assigned a default value, which is shown
       at the head of the rightmost column.

   INPUT STYLE SPECIFIERS
       actual <char>            ´@´
                                Symbol indicating that the next entry is to appear in the output file.

       arg_close <char>         ´}´
                                Closing delimiter for the index entry argument.

       arg_open <char>          ´{´
                                Opening delimiter for the index entry argument.

       encap <char>             ´|´
                                Symbol indicating that the rest of the argument list is to be used as  the  encapsu‐
                                lating command for the page number.

       escape <char>            ´\\´
                                Symbol  which  escapes  the following letter, unless its preceding letter is escape.
                                Note: quote is used to escape the letter which immediately follows it, but if it  is
                                preceded  by  escape, it is treated as a ordinary character.  These two symbols must
                                be distinct.

       keyword <string>         "\\indexentry"
                                Command which tells makeindex that its argument is an index entry.

       level <char>             ´!´
                                Delimiter denoting a new level of subitem.

       page_compositor <string> "-"
                                Delimiter separating parts of a composite page number (see SPECIAL EFFECTS below).

       quote <char>             ´"´
                                Note: quote is used to escape the letter which immediately follows it, but if it  is
                                preceded  by  escape, it is treated as a ordinary character.  These two symbols must
                                be distinct.

       range_close <char>       ´)´
                                Closing delimiter indicating the end of an explicit page range.

       range_open <char>        ´(´
                                Opening delimiter indicating the beginning of an explicit page range.

                                group  (symbols,  numbers,  and  the 26 letters): positive values cause an uppercase
                                letter to be inserted between prefix and suffix, and negative values cause a  lower‐
                                case letter to be inserted (default is 0, which produces no header).

       item_x1 <string>         "\n    \\subitem "
                                Command  to be inserted between a level 0 item and a level 1 item, where the level 0

EXAMPLES
   TeX EXAMPLE
       The following example shows a style file called book.ist, which defines an index for a book which can be for‐
       matted independently of the main source:

              preamble
              "\\documentstyle[12pt]{book}
              \\begin{document}
              \\begin{theindex}
              {\\small\n"
              postamble
              "\n\n}
              \\end{theindex}
              \\end{document}\n"

       Assuming that a particular book style requires the index (as well as any chapters) to start from an odd  page
       number,  and  that  the  input  file  is  named  foo.idx,  the following command line produces output in file
       footmp.ind:

              makeindex  -s book.ist  -o footmp.ind  -p odd  foo

       Here a non-default output file name is used to avoid clobbering the output for the  book  itself  (presumably
       foo.dvi, which would have been the default name for the index output file!).

   TROFF EXAMPLE
       A sample control file for creating an index, which we will assume resides in the file sample.ist:

              keyword "IX:"
              preamble

       The  local macro package may require modification, as in this example of an extension to the -ms macros (note
       that at some sites, this macro should replace a pre-existing macro of the same name):

              .
              .de IX
              .ie '\\n(.z'' .tm IX: \\$1 \\$2 \\$3 \\$4 \\$5 \\$6 \\$7 \\$8 \\$9 {\\n(PN}
              .el \\!.IX \\$1 \\$2 \\$3 \\$4 \\$5 \\$6 \\$7 \\$8 \\$9 {\\n(PN}
              ..

       (note that the string {\\n(PN} is separated from the rest of the line by a tab.  If your local macro  package
       does  not  contain  this extension, just include those lines at the beginning of your file.  Here is a simple
       troff(1) input file, which we will assume is named sample.txt:

              This is a sample file to test the \fImakeindex\fP(1L)
              program, and see
              .IX {indexing!programs!C language}
              .IX {makeindex@\fImakeindex\fP(1L)}
              .bp
              .rs
              .IX {Knuth}
              .IX {typesetting!computer-aided}
              how well it functions in the \fItroff\fP(1) environment.

       Note that index entries are indicated by the .IX macro, which causes the following text to be written to std‐
       out along with the current page number.

   CREATING THE INDEX FILE IN THE BOURNE SHELL
       To create an input file for makeindex, in the Bourne shell environment, do the equivalent at your site of the
       command:

       psroff -ms -Tpsc -t sample.txt > /dev/null 2> sample.tmp

       Some sites will require ditroff instead of psroff.  To filter out any genuine error messages, invoke grep(1):

              grep '^IX: ' sample.tmp > sample.idx

   CREATING THE INDEX FILE USING UCSF ENHANCED TROFF/TRANSCRIPT
       With UCSF Enhanced troff/TRANSCRIPT, the -I option of psroff(1L) can produce both  formatter  output  and  an
       index file:

              psroff -ms -I sample.inp -Tpsc sample.txt

       If it is wished to suppress the formatter output:

              psroff -ms -I sample.inp -Tpsc -t sample.txt > /dev/null

   COMPLETING THE INDEX
       Any of the above procedures leaves the input for makeindex in sample.inp.  The next step is to invoke makein‐
       dex:

              makeindex -s sample.ist sample.idx

       This leaves troff(1)-ready output in the file sample.ind.

ORDERING
       By default, makeindex assumes word ordering; if the -l option is in effect, letter ordering is used.  In word
       ordering,  a blank precedes any letter in the alphabet, whereas in letter ordering, it does not count at all.
       This is illustrated by the following example:

              word order                      letter order
              sea lion                        seal
              seal                            sea lion

       Numbers are always sorted in numeric order.  For instance,

              9 (nine),  123
              10 (ten), see Derek, Bo

       Letters are first sorted without regard to case; when words are identical, the uppercase version precedes its
       lowercase counterpart.

       A  special  symbol  is  defined here to be any character not appearing in the union of digits and the English
       alphabetic characters.  Patterns starting with special symbols precede numbers, which precede patterns start‐
       ing  with letters.  As a special case, a string starting with a digit but mixed with non-digits is considered
       to be a pattern starting with a special character.

SPECIAL EFFECTS
       Entries such as

              \indexentry{alpha}{1}
              \indexentry{alpha!beta}{3}
              \indexentry{alpha!beta!gamma}{10}

       in the input file will be converted to

              \item alpha, 1
                 \subitem beta, 3
                    \subsubitem gamma, 10

       in the output index file.  Notice that the level symbol (`!') is used above to delimit hierarchical levels.

       It is possible to make an item appear in a designated form by using the actual (`@') operator.  For instance,

              \indexentry{alpha@{\it alpha\/}}{1}

       will become

              \item {\it alpha\/},  1

       after processing.  The pattern preceding `@' is used as sort key, whereas the one following it is written  to
       the  output  file.   Note that two appearances of the same key, one with and one without the actual operator,
       are regarded as distinct entries.

       The item, subitem, and subsubitem fields may have individual sort keys:

              \indexentry{aa@{\it aa\/}!bb@{\it bb\/}!cc@{\it cc\/}}{1}

       This will be converted to

              \item {\it aa}, 1
                 \subitem {\it bb}, 3
                    \subsubitem {\it cc}, 10

       It is possible to encapsulate a page number with a designated command using the encap (`|') operator:

              \indexentry{alpha|bold}{1}

       will be converted to

              \item alpha, \bold{1}

       where, with a suitable definition for TeX, \bold{n} will expand to {\bf n}.  In this example, the three  out‐
       put  attributes associated with page encapsulation encap_prefix, encap_infix, and encap_suffix, correspond to
       backslash, left brace, and right brace, respectively.  This mechanism allows page numbers to be set  in  dif‐
       ferent  fonts.  For example, the page where the definition of a keyword appears can be in one font, the loca‐
       tion of a primary example can be in another font, and other appearances in yet a third font.

       The encap operator can also be used to create cross references in the index:

              \indexentry{alpha|see{beta}}{1}

       will become

              \item alpha, \see{beta}{1}

       in the output file, where

              \see{beta}{1}

       will expand to

              {\it see\/} beta

       Note that in a cross reference like this the page number disappears.

       A pair of encap concatenated with range_open (`|(') and range_close (`|)') creates an explicit page range:

              \indexentry{alpha|(}{1}
              \indexentry{alpha|)}{5}

       will become

              \item alpha, 1—5

       Intermediate pages indexed by the same key will be merged into the range implicitly.  This is especially use‐
       ful  when an entire section about a particular subject is to be indexed, in which case only the range opening
       and closing operators need to be inserted at the beginning and end of the section.  Explicit page range  for‐
       mation can also include an extra command to set the page range in a designated font:

              \indexentry{alpha|(bold}{1}
              \indexentry{alpha|)}{5}

       will become

              \item alpha, \bold{1--5}

       Several potential problems are worth mentioning.  First, entries like

              \indexentry{alpha|(}{1}
              \indexentry{alpha|bold}{3}
              \indexentry{alpha|)}{5}

       will be interpreted as

              \item alpha, \bold{3}, 1--5

       but  with  a  warning  message  in  the  transcript about encountering an inconsistent page encapsulator.  An
       explicit range beginning in a Roman page number and ending in Arabic is also considered an  error.   In  this
       instance,  (if  possible)  the range is broken into two subranges, one in Roman and the other in Arabic.  For
       instance,

              \indexentry{alpha|(}{i}
              \indexentry{alpha}{iv}
              \indexentry{alpha}{3}
              \indexentry{alpha|)}{7}

       will be turned into

              \item alpha, i--iv, 3--7

       with a warning message in the transcript file complaining about an illegal range formation.

       Every special symbol mentioned in this section may be escaped by the quote operator (`"').  Thus

              \indexentry{alpha"@beta}{1}

       will actually become

              \item alpha@beta,  1

       as a result of executing makeindex.  The quoting power of quote is eliminated if it is  immediately  preceded
       by escape (`\').  For example,

              \indexentry{f\"ur}{1}

       becomes

              \item f\"ur, 1

       which represents an umlaut-accented `u' to the TeX family of processors.

       A  page  number  can be a composite of one or more fields separated by the delimiter bound to page_compositor
       (`-'), e.g., II-12 for page 12 of Chapter II.  Page numbers may contain up to ten fields.

       Since version 2.11 of makeindex, the quote operator may quote any character in the range 1 ... 255.   Charac‐
       ter  0  is  excluded because it is used internally in the makeindex source code as a string terminator.  With
       this change, sort keys can be created for all eight-bit characters except 0.  The sorting order is

              punctuation characters (in ASCII order),
              digits,
              control characters (1 ... 31),
              space (32),
              letters (ignoring case),
              characters 127 ... 255.

       Here is an example showing the indexing of all printable ASCII characters  other  than  letters  and  digits,
       assuming  the  default  TeX  format.  For convenience, the page number references are the corresponding ASCII
       ordinal values.

              \indexentry{" @"  (space)}{32}
              \indexentry{"!@"! (exclamation point)}{33}
              \indexentry{""@"" (quotation mark)}{34}
              \indexentry{"#@"\# (sharp sign)}{35}
              \indexentry{"$@"\$ (dollar sign)}{36}
              \indexentry{"%@"\% (percent sign)}{37}
              \indexentry{"&@"\& (ampersand)}{38}
              \indexentry{"<@"$<$ (left angle bracket)}{60}
              \indexentry{"=@"= (equals)}{61}
              \indexentry{">@"$>$ (right angle bracket)}{62}
              \indexentry{"?@"? (query)}{63}
              \indexentry{"@@"@ (at sign)}{64}
              \indexentry{"[@"[ (left square bracket)}{91}
              \indexentry{"\@"\verb=\= (backslash)}{92}
              \indexentry{"]@"] (right square bracket)}{93}
              \indexentry{"^@"\verb=^= (caret)}{94}
              \indexentry{"_@"\verb=_= (underscore)}{95}
              \indexentry{"`@"\verb=~= (grave accent)}{96}
              \indexentry{"{@"\"{ (left brace)}{123}
              \indexentry{"|@"\verb="|= (vertical bar)}{124}
              \indexentry{"}@"\"} (right brace)}{125}
              \indexentry{"~@"\verb=~= (tilde)}{126}

       Characters in the actual fields following the `@' character which have special significance to  TeX  must  be
       represented  as  control sequences, or as math mode characters.  Note particularly how the entries for the at
       sign, left and right braces, and the vertical bar, are coded.  The index file output by  makeindex  for  this
       example looks like this:

              \begin{theindex}

                \item ! (exclamation point), 33
                \item " (quotation mark), 34
                \item \# (sharp sign), 35
                \item \$ (dollar sign), 36
                \item \% (percent sign), 37
                \item \& (ampersand), 38
                \item $<$ (left angle bracket), 60
                \item = (equals), 61
                \item $>$ (right angle bracket), 62
                \item ? (query), 63
                \item @ (at sign), 64
                \item [ (left square bracket), 91
                \item \verb=\= (backslash), 92
                \item ] (right square bracket), 93
                \item \verb=^= (caret), 94
                \item \verb=_= (underscore), 95
                \item \verb=~= (grave accent), 96
                \item \{ (left brace), 123
                \item \verb=|= (vertical bar), 124
                \item \} (right brace), 125
                \item \verb=~= (tilde), 126

                \indexspace

                \item   (space), 32

              \end{theindex}
