NAME
       devdump, isoinfo, isovfy, isodump - Utility programs for dumping and verifying iso9660 images.

SYNOPSIS
       devdump isoimage

       isodump isoimage

       isoinfo  [  -d  ]  [  -h ] [ -R ] [ -J ] [ -j charset ] [ -f ] [ -l ] [ -p ] [ -T sector ] [ -N sector ] [ -i
       isoimage ] [ -x path ]

       isovfy isoimage

DESCRIPTION
       devdump is a crude utility to interactively display the contents of device or filesystem images.  The initial
       screen  is a display of the first 256 bytes of the first 2048 byte sector.  The commands are the same as with
       isodump.

       isodump is a crude utility to interactively display the contents of iso9660 images in order to verify  direc‐
       tory  integrity.   The  initial  screen  is a display of the first part of the root directory, and the prompt
       shows you the extent number and offset in the extent.

              You can use the 'a' and 'b' commands to move backwards and forwards within the image. The 'g'  command
              allows  you to goto an arbitrary extent, and the 'f' command specifies a search string to be used. The
              '+' command searches forward for the next instance of the search string, and  the  'q'  command  exits
              devdump or isodump.

       isoinfo is a utility to perform directory like listings of iso9660 images.

       isovfy is a utility to verify the integrity of an iso9660 image. Most of the tests in isovfy were added after
       bugs were discovered in early versions of genisoimage.  It isn't all that clear how useful this  is  anymore,
       but it doesn't hurt to have this around.


OPTIONS
       The  options  common  to  all programs are -help,-h,-version, i=name,dev=name.  The isoinfo program has addi‐
       tional command line options. The options are:

       -help

       -h     print a summary of all options.

       -d     Print information from the primary volume descriptor (PVD) of the iso9660 image. This includes  infor‐
              mation about Rock Ridge, Joliet extensions and Eltorito boot information if present.

       -f     generate  output as if a 'find . -print' command had been run on the iso9660 image. You should not use
              the -l image with the -f option.

       -i iso_image
              Specifies the path of the iso9660 image that we wish to examine.  The options -i  and  dev=target  are
              mutual exclusive.

       dev=target
              Sets  the SCSI target for the drive, see notes above.  A typical device specification is dev=6,0 .  If
              a filename must be provided together with the numerical target specification, the filename  is  imple‐
              mentation  specific.  The correct filename in this case can be found in the system specific manuals of
              the target operating system.  On a FreeBSD system without CAM support, you need  to  use  the  control
              device  (e.g.  /dev/rcd0.ctl).  A correct device specification in this case may be dev=/dev/rcd0.ctl:@
              .

              On Linux, drives connected to a parallel port adapter are mapped to  a  virtual  SCSI  bus.  Different
              adapters are mapped to different targets on this virtual SCSI bus.

              If no dev option is present, the program will try to get the device from the CDR_DEVICE environment.

              If  the argument to the dev= option does not contain the characters ',', '/', '@' or ':', it is inter‐
              preted as an label name that may be found in the file /etc/wodim.conf (see FILES section).

              The options -i and dev=target are mutual exclusive.

       -l     generate output as if a 'ls -lR' command had been run on the iso9660 image.  You should not use the -f
              image with the -l option.

       -N sector
              Quick  hack  to help examine single session disc files that are to be written to a multi-session disc.
              The sector number specified is the sector number at which the iso9660 image  should  be  written  when
              send to the cd-writer. Not used for the first session on the disc.

       -p     Print path table information.

       -R     Extract  information  from  Rock  Ridge extensions (if present) for permissions, file names and owner‐
              ships.

       -J     Extract information from Joliet extensions (if present) for file names.

       -j charset
              Convert Joliet file names (if present) to the supplied charset. See genisoimage(8) for details.

       -T sector
              Quick hack to help examine multi-session images that have already been burned to a multi-session disc.
              The sector number specified is the sector number for the start of the session we wish to display.

       -x pathname
              Extract specified file to stdout.

       This manpage describes the program implementation of isoinfo as  shipped  by  the  cdrkit  distribution.  See
       http://alioth.debian.org/projects/debburn/ for details. It is a spinoff from the original program distributed
       in the cdrtools package [1]. However, the cdrtools developers are not involved in  the  development  of  this
       spinoff  and  therefore shall not be made responsible for any problem caused by it. Do not try to get support
       for this program by contacting the original author(s).

       If you have support questions, send them to

BUGS
       The user interface really sucks.

FUTURE IMPROVEMENTS
       These  utilities are really quick hacks, which are very useful for debugging problems in genisoimage or in an
       iso9660 filesystem. In the long run, it would be nice to have a daemon that would NFS export a iso9660 image.

       The isoinfo program is probably the program that is of the most use to the general user.

AVAILABILITY
       These  utilities  come  with  the  cdrkit  package,  and   the   primary   download   site   is   http://deb‐
       burn.alioth.debian.org/ and FTP mirrors of distributions.  Despite the name, the software is not beta.


ENVIRONMENT
       CDR_DEVICE
              This  may  either  hold  a  device  identifier that is suitable to the open call of the SCSI transport
              library or a label in the file /etc/wodim.conf.

       RSH    If the RSH environment is present, the remote connection will not be created via rcmd(3) but by  call‐
              ing the program pointed to by RSH.  Use e.g.  RSH=/usr/bin/ssh to create a secure shell connection.

              Note  that this forces the program to create a pipe to the rsh(1) program and disallows the program to
              directly access the network socket to the remote server.  This makes it impossible to set  up  perfor‐
              mance parameters and slows down the connection compared to a root initiated rcmd(3) connection.

       RSCSI  If   the   RSCSI   environment   is   present,  the  remote  SCSI  server  will  not  be  the  program
              /opt/schily/sbin/rscsi but the program pointed to by RSCSI.  Note that the remote SCSI server  program
              name  will  be  ignored if you log in using an account that has been created with a remote SCSI server
              program as login shell.


FILES
       /etc/wodim.conf
              Default values can be set for the following options in /etc/wodim.conf.

              CDR_DEVICE
                     This may either hold a device identifier that is suitable to the open call of the  SCSI  trans‐
                     port library or a label in the file /etc/wodim.conf that allows to identify a specific drive on
                     the system.

              Any other label
                     is an identifier for a specific drive on the system.  Such an identifier may  not  contain  the
                     characters ',', '/', '@' or ':'.

                     Each  line  that follows a label contains a TAB separated list of items.  Currently, four items
                     are recognized: the SCSI ID of the drive, the default speed that should be used for this drive,
                     the default FIFO size that should be used for this drive and drive specific options. The values
                     for speed and fifosize may be set to -1 to tell the program to use the  global  defaults.   The
                     value  for driveropts may be set to "" if no driveropts are used.  A typical line may look this
                     way:

                     teac1= 0,5,0   4    8m   ""

                     yamaha= 1,6,0  -1   -1   burnfree

                     This tells the program that a drive named teac1 is at scsibus 0, target 5, lun 0 and should  be
                     used with speed 4 and a FIFO size of 8 MB.  A second drive may be found at scsibus 1, target 6,
                     lun 0 and uses the default speed and the default FIFO size.
