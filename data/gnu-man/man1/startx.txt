STARTX(1)                                      General Commands Manual                                     STARTX(1)



NAME
       startx - initialize an X session

SYNOPSIS
       startx [ [ client ] options ... ] [ -- [ server ] [ display ] options ... ]

DESCRIPTION
       The startx script is a front end to xinit(1) that provides a somewhat nicer user interface for running a sin‐
       gle session of the X Window System.  It is often run with no arguments.

       Arguments immediately following the startx command are used to start a client in the same manner as xinit(1).
       The  special  argument '--' marks the end of client arguments and the beginning of server options.  It may be
       convenient to specify server options with startx to change on a per-session basis the  default  color  depth,
       the  server's  notion of the number of dots-per-inch the display device presents, or take advantage of a dif‐
       ferent server layout, as permitted by the Xorg(1) server and specified  in  the  xorg.conf(5)  configuration.
       Some  examples  of specifying server arguments follow; consult the manual page for your X server to determine
       which arguments are legal.

              startx -- -depth 16

              startx -- -dpi 100

              startx -- -layout Multihead

       To determine the client to run, startx first looks for a file called .xinitrc in the user's  home  directory.
       If  that  is  not  found,  it  uses  the file xinitrc in the xinit library directory.  If command line client
       options are given, they override this behavior and revert to the xinit(1) behavior.  To determine the  server
       to  run, startx first looks for a file called .xserverrc in the user's home directory.  If that is not found,
       it uses the file xserverrc in the xinit library directory.  If command line server options  are  given,  they
       override  this behavior and revert to the xinit(1) behavior.  Users rarely need to provide a .xserverrc file.
       See the xinit(1) manual page for more details on the arguments.

       The system-wide xinitrc and xserverrc files are found in the /etc/X11/xinit directory.

ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES
       DISPLAY                  This variable gets set to the name of the display to which clients  should  connect.
                                Note that this gets set, not read.

       XAUTHORITY               This  variable, if not already defined, gets set to $(HOME)/.Xauthority.  This is to
                                prevent the X server, if not given the -auth argument, from automatically setting up
                                insecure  host-based authentication for the local host.  See the Xserver(1) and Xse‐
                                curity(7) manual pages for more information on X client/server authentication.

FILES
       $(HOME)/.xinitrc         Client to run.  Typically a shell script which runs many programs in the background.

       $(HOME)/.xserverrc       Server to run.  The default is X.

       /etc/X11/xinit/xinitrc   Client to run if the user has no .xinitrc file.

       /etc/X11/xinit/xserverrc Server to run if the user has no .xserverrc file.
