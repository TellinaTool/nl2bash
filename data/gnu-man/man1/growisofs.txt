NAME
       growisofs - combined genisoimage frontend/DVD recording program.

SYNOPSIS
       growisofs [-dry-run] [-dvd-compat] [-overburn] [-speed=1] -[Z|M] /dev/dvd <genisoimage-options>


DESCRIPTION
       growisofs  was  originally  designed  as a frontend to genisoimage to facilitate appending of data to ISO9660
       volumes residing on random-access media such as DVD+RW, DVD-RAM, plain files, hard disk  partitions.  In  the
       course of development general purpose DVD recording support was implemented, and as of now growisofs supports
       not only random-access media, but even mastering of multisession DVD media such as DVD+R  and  DVD-R/-RW,  as
       well  as  Blu-ray  Disc. In addition growisofs supports first-/single-session recording of arbitrary pre-mas‐
       tered image (formatted as UDF, ISO9660 or any other file system, if formatted at all) to  all  supported  DVD
       media types.


OPTIONS
       -Z /dev/dvd
              Burn an initial session to the selected device. A special form of this option is recognized to support
              burning of pre-mastered images. See EXAMPLES section for further details.

       -M /dev/dvd
              Merge a new session to an existing one.

       -version
              Print version information and invoke genisoimage, also with -version option.

       -dvd-compat
              Provide maximum media compatibility with DVD-ROM/-Video. In write-once DVD+R  or  DVD-R  context  this
              results  in  unappendable  recording (closed disk). In DVD+RW context it instructs the logical unit to
              explicitly burn [otherwise optional] lead-out.

       -dry-run
              At dry-run growisofs performs all the steps till, but not including the first  write  operation.  Most
              notably  check  for  "overburn"  condition is performed, which implies that genisoimage is invoked and
              terminated prematurely.

       -overburn
              Normally single layer DVD media can accommodate up to approximately 4.700.000.000 bytes (in  marketing
              speech  4.7GB). In other words a DVD can contain about 4.377 GiB or 4482 MiB. Same kind of arithmetics
              applies to Blu-ray Disc capacity of 25.000.000.000 bytes. Anyway, growisofs won't start  without  this
              option, if "overburn" condition appears to be unavoidable.

       -speed=N
              An  option  to  control recording velocity. Most commonly you'll use -speed=1 with "no-name" media, if
              default speed setting messes up the media. Keep in mind that N essentially denotes  speed  closest  to
              N*1385KBps in DVD or N*4496KBps in Blu-ray Disc case among those offered by unit for currently mounted
              media. The list can be found in dvd+rw-mediainfo output. Note that Blu-ray Disc  recordings  are  com‐
              monly performed at ~1/2 of advertised speed, because of defect management being in effect.

       <genisoimage-options>
              More options can be found in the manpage for genisoimage.


       There  are  several undocumented options commonly denoted with -use-the-force-luke prefix. Some of them serve
       debugging purposes. Some require certain knowledge about recording process or even OS kernel internals and as
       being  such can induce confusing behaviour. Some are to be used in very specific situations better recognized
       by front-ends or automated scripts. Rationale behind leaving these options undocumented  is  that  those  few
       users  who  would  actually  need to use them directly can as well consult the source code or obtain specific
       instructions elsewhere.


DIFFERENCES WITH RUNNING GENISOIMAGE DIRECTLY
       When using growisofs you may not use the -o option for an output file.  growisofs dumps the image directly to
       the media;

       You  don't  have  to specify the -C option to create a higher level session on a multisession disk, growisofs
       will construct one for you;

       Otherwise everything that applies to [multisession] mastering with genisoimage applies to growisofs as  well.
       growisofs needs at least mkisofs version 1.14, version 2.0 is required for multisession write-once recordings
       or genisoimage.


EXAMPLES
       Actual device names vary from one operating system to another. We use /dev/dvd as a  collective  name  or  as
       symbolic  link  to the actual device if you wish. Under Linux it will most likely be an ide-scsi device  such
       as "/dev/scd0." Under NetBSD/OpenBSD it has to be a character SCSI CD-ROM device such as "/dev/rcd0c."  Under
       Solaris   it   also   has  to  be  a  character  SCSI/ATAPI  CD-ROM  device,  e.g.   "/dev/rdsk/c0t1d0s2"  or
       "/vol/dev/aliases/cdrom0." And likewise in HP-UX, IRIX and Mac OS X...

       To master and burn an ISO9660 volume with Joliet and Rock-Ridge extensions on a DVD or Blu-ray Disc:

            growisofs -Z /dev/dvd -R -J /some/files

       To append more data to same media:

            growisofs -M /dev/dvd -R -J /more/files

       Make sure to use the same options for both initial burning and when appending data.

       To finalize the multisession DVD maintaining maximum compatibility:

            growisofs -M /dev/dvd=/dev/zero

       To use growisofs to write a pre-mastered ISO-image to a DVD:

            growisofs -dvd-compat -Z /dev/dvd=image.iso

       where image.iso represents an arbitrary object in the filesystem, such as file, named pipe or  device  entry.
       Nothing is growing here and command name is not intuitive in this context.


NOTES
       If  executed under sudo(8) growisofs refuses to start. This is done for the following reason. Naturally grow‐
       isofs has to access the data set to be recorded to optical media, either indirectly  by  letting  genisoimage
       generate  ISO9660  layout  on-the-fly  or  directly if a pre-mastered image is to be recorded. Being executed
       under sudo(8), growisofs effectively grants sudoers read access to any file in the file system. The situation
       is  intensified  by  the  fact  that  growisofs parses GENISOIMAGE environment variable in order to determine
       alternative path to genisoimage executable image. This means that being  executed  under  sudo(8),  growisofs
       effectively  grants sudoers right to execute program of their choice with elevated privileges. If you for any
       reason still find the above acceptable and are willing to take the consequences, then consider  running  fol‐
       lowing wrapper script under sudo(8) in place for real growisofs binary.

            #!/bin/ksh
            unset SUDO_COMMAND
            export GENISOIMAGE=/path/to/trusted/genisoimage
            exec growisofs "$@"

       But  note  that  the  recommended  alternative  to  the  above  "workaround" is actually to install growisofs
       set-root-uid, in which case it will drop privileges prior accessing data or executing genisoimage in order to
       preclude unauthorized access to the data.

       If  the  media  already carries isofs and growisofs is invoked with -Z option non-interactively, e.g. through
       cron, it shall fail with "FATAL: /dev/dvd already carries isofs!" Note that only ISO9660 is  recognized,  you
       can perfectly zap e.g. an UDF filesystem non-interactively. Recommendation is to prepare media for unattended
       usage by re-formatting or nullifying first 64KB in advance.

       "Overburn" protection in pre-mastered image context works only with plain files and  ISO9660  formatted  vol‐
       umes.  E.g.  [given  that /dev/root is an ext2 formatted file system larger than 4.7GB] /dev/dvd=/dev/root is
       bound to produce corrupted recording.

       Note that DVD+RW re-formatting procedure does not substitute for blanking. If you want to nullify the  media,
       e.g. for privacy reasons, do it explicitly with 'growisofs -Z /dev/dvd=/dev/zero'.

       Playback  of  re-writable DVD media, both DVD+RW and DVD-RW, might be limited in legacy DVD-ROM/-Video units.
       In most cases this is due to lower reflectivity of such media.

       Even though growisofs supports it, playback of multisession write-once DVD might be limited to the first ses‐
       sion for two reasons:


       ·      not  all DVD-ROM players are capable of multi-border DVD-R playback, even less are aware of DVD+R mul‐
              tisessioning, burner unit therefore might be the only one in your vicinity capable of accessing  files
              written at different occasions;

       ·      OS might fail to mount multisession DVD for various reasons;

       The  above  is not applicable to DVD+RW, DVD-RW Restricted Overwrite, DVD-RAM or Blu-ray Disc, as volumes are
       grown within a single session.

       When growisofs "runs into" blank Blu-ray Disc media, BD-RE or BD-R, it gets pre-formatted with minimal  spare
       area size of 256MB.
