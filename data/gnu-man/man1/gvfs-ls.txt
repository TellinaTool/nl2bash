NAME
       gvfs-ls - List files

SYNOPSIS
       gvfs-ls [OPTION...] [LOCATION...]

DESCRIPTION
       gvfs-ls lists information about the given locations. If no location is given, it defaults to the current
       directory.

       gvfs-ls is similar to the traditional ls utility, but using gvfs locations instead of local files: for
       example you can use something like smb://server/resource/file.txt as location.

       File attributes can be specified with their gvfs name, e.g. standard::icon, or just by namespace, e.g. unix,
       or by '*' which matches all attributes. Several attributes or groups can be specified, separated by comma.

       -?, --help
           Prints a short help text and exits.

       -a, --attributes=ATTRIBUTES

       -h, --hidden
           Show hidden files.

       -l, --long
           Use a long listing format.

       -c, --show-completions=PREFIX
