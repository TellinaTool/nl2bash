NAME
       pnmpsnr - compute the difference between two portable anymaps

SYNOPSIS
       pnmpsnr [pnmfile1] [pnmfile2]


DESCRIPTION
       Reads two PBM, PGM, or PPM files, or PAM equivalents, as input.  Prints the peak signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR)
       difference between the two images.  This metric is typically used in image compression  papers  to  rate  the
       distortion between original and decoded image.

       If  the inputs are PBM or PGM, pnmpsnr prints the PSNR of the luminance only.  Otherwise, it prints the sepa‐
       rate PSNRs of the luminance, and chrominance (Cb and Cr) components of the colors.

       The PSNR of a given component is the ratio of the mean square difference of the component for the two  images
       to  the  maximum  mean  square difference that can exist betwee any two images.  It is expressed as a decibel
       value.

       The mean square difference of a component for two images is the  mean  square  difference  of  the  component
       value, comparing each pixel with the pixel in the same position of the other image.  For the purposes of this
       computation, components are normalized to the scale [0..1].

       The maximum mean square difference is identically 1.

       So the higher the PSNR, the closer the images are.  A luminance PSNR of 20 means the mean  square  difference
       of the luminances of the pixels is 100 times less than the maximum possible difference, i.e. 0.01.
