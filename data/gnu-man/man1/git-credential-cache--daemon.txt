GIT-CREDENTIAL-CAC(1)                                Git Manual                                GIT-CREDENTIAL-CAC(1)



NAME
       git-credential-cache--daemon - Temporarily store user credentials in memory

SYNOPSIS
       git credential-cache—daemon <socket>


DESCRIPTION
           Note
           You probably don’t want to invoke this command yourself; it is started automatically when you use git-
           credential-cache(1).

       This command listens on the Unix domain socket specified by <socket> for git-credential-cache clients.
       Clients may store and retrieve credentials. Each credential is held for a timeout specified by the client;
       once no credentials are held, the daemon exits.
