GIT-MKTAG(1)                                         Git Manual                                         GIT-MKTAG(1)



NAME
       git-mktag - Creates a tag object

SYNOPSIS
       git mktag < signature_file


DESCRIPTION
       Reads a tag contents on standard input and creates a tag object that can also be used to sign other objects.

       The output is the new tag’s <object> identifier.

TAG FORMAT
       A tag signature file has a very simple fixed format: four lines of

           object <sha1>
           type <typename>
           tag <tagname>
           tagger <tagger>

       followed by some optional free-form message (some tags created by older Git may not have tagger line). The
       message, when exists, is separated by a blank line from the header. The message part may contain a signature
       that Git itself doesn’t care about, but that can be verified with gpg.
