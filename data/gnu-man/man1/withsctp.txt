NAME
       withsctp - Run TCP binaries over SCTP


SYNOPSIS
       withsctp


DESCRIPTION
       This  package  enables  you  to use SCTP with your existing TCP-based binaries.  withsctp uses the LD_PRELOAD
       hack to intercept library calls used for TCP connections and use SCTP instead.


EXAMPLES
       withsctp xinetd
              # Start xinetd stream services on SCTP.

       withsctp telnet localhost
              # Make a telnet over SCTP/IP connection.
