NAME
       stubmaker - Generates client stubs from a WSDL file.

OPTIONS
       -d <dirname>
           Specifies the directory you wish to output the files to. The directory must already exist.

       -v  Turns on "verbose" output during the code stub generation process. To be honest, there is not much the
           program outputs, but if you must see something output to the console, then this fits the bill.

       --help
           Outputs a short help message.

       --version
           Outputs the current version of stubmaker.

STUB FILES
   STUB SUBROUTINES
       The "class" or "package" created by stubmaker is actually a sub-class of the core SOAP::Lite object. As a
       result, all methods one can call upon SOAP::Lite one can also call upon generated stubs.

       For example, suppose you wanted to obtain readable output from the generated stub, then simply call
       readable(1) on the stub's instance. See the example below.

       The following subroutines are unique to generated stub classes, and help the user control and configure the
       stub class.

       want_som(boolean)
           When set to 1, SOAP::Lite will return SOAP::SOM objects to the user upon invoking a method on a remote
           service. This is very helpful when you need to check to see if the return value is a SOAP::Fault or not.
           When set to 0, SOAP::Lite will return the return value of the method.

EXAMPLES
   Invoking stubmaker from the command line
       > perl stubmaker http://www.xmethods.net/sd/StockQuoteService.wsdl Or: > perl "-MStockQuoteService qw(:all)"
       -le "print getQuote('MSFT')"

   Working with stub classes
       Command line: > perl stubmaker http://ws1.api.re2.yahoo.com/ws/soap-demo/full.wsdl

       File: echo > use full; > use SOAP::Lite +trace => qw( debug ); > my $f = new full; > $f->use_prefix(0); >
       $f->readable(1); > $f->want_som(1); > $som = $f->echoViaBase64("foo");
