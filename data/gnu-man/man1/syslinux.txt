SYSLINUX(1)                                    General Commands Manual                                   SYSLINUX(1)



NAME
       syslinux - install the SYSLINUX bootloader on a FAT filesystem

SYNOPSIS
       syslinux [OPTIONS] device

DESCRIPTION
       Syslinux is a boot loader for the Linux operating system which operates off an MS-DOS/Windows FAT filesystem.
       It is intended to simplify first-time installation of Linux, and for creation of rescue  and  other  special-
       purpose boot disks.

       In order to create a bootable Linux floppy using Syslinux, prepare a normal MS-DOS formatted floppy. Copy one
       or more Linux kernel files to it, then execute the command:

              syslinux --install /dev/fd0

       This will alter the boot sector on the disk and copy a file named ldlinux.sys into its root directory.

       On boot time, by default, the kernel will be loaded from the image named LINUX  on  the  boot  floppy.   This
       default can be changed, see the section on the syslinux configuration file.

       If  the  Shift or Alt keys are held down during boot, or the Caps or Scroll locks are set, syslinux will dis‐
       play a lilo(8) -style "boot:" prompt. The user can then type a kernel file name followed by any kernel param‐
       eters.  The  SYSLINUX bootloader does not need to know about the kernel file in advance; all that is required
       is that it is a file located in the root directory on the disk.

       Syslinux supports the loading of initial ramdisks (initrd) and the bzImage kernel format.

OPTIONS
       -i, --install
              Install SYSLINUX on a new medium, overwriting any previously installed bootloader.

       -U, --update
              Install SYSLINUX on a new medium if and only if a version of SYSLINUX is already installed.

       -s, --stupid
              Install a "safe, slow and stupid" version of SYSLINUX. This version may work on some very buggy BIOSes
              on  which  SYSLINUX would otherwise fail.  If you find a machine on which the -s option is required to
              make it boot reliably, please send as much info about your machine as you can, and include the failure
              mode.

       -f, --force
              Force install even if it appears unsafe.

       -r, --raid
              RAID  mode.   If  boot  fails, tell the BIOS to boot the next device in the boot sequence (usually the
              next hard disk) instead of stopping with an error message.  This is useful for RAID-1 booting.

       -d, --directory subdirectory
              Install the SYSLINUX control files in a subdirectory with the specified name  (relative  to  the  root
              directory on the device).

       -t, --offset offset
              Indicates that the filesystem is at an offset from the base of the device or file.

       --once command
              Declare a boot command to be tried on the first boot only.

       -O, --clear-once
              Clear the boot-once command.

       -H, --heads head-count
              Override the detected number of heads for the geometry.

       -S, --sectors sector-count
              Override the detected number of sectors for the geometry.

       -z, --zipdrive
              Assume zipdrive geometry (--heads 64 --sectors 32).

FILES
   Configuration file
       All the configurable defaults in SYSLINUX can be changed by putting a file called syslinux.cfg in the install
       directory of the boot disk. This is a text file in either UNIX or DOS format, containing one or more  of  the
       following items (case is insensitive for keywords).

       This list is out of date.

       In the configuration file blank lines and comment lines beginning with a hash mark (#) are ignored.

       default kernel [ options ... ]
              Sets  the  default  command  line. If syslinux boots automatically, it will act just as if the entries
              after "default" had been typed in at the "boot:" prompt.

              If no DEFAULT or UI statement is found, or the configuration file is missing entirely, SYSLINUX  drops
              to  the boot: prompt with an error message (if NOESCAPE is set, it stops with a "boot failed" message;
              this is also the case for PXELINUX if the configuration file is not found.)

       NOTE: Until SYSLINUX 3.85, if no configuration file is present, or no
              "default" entry is present in the configuration file, the default is "linux auto".

       Even earlier versions of SYSLINUX used to automatically
              append the string "auto" to whatever the user specified using the  DEFAULT  command.   As  of  version
              1.54,  this  is  no  longer true, as it caused problems when using a shell as a substitute for "init."
              You may want to include this option manually.

       append options ...
              Add one or more options to the kernel command line. These are added  both  for  automatic  and  manual
              boots.  The  options  are  added  at the very beginning of the kernel command line, usually permitting
              explicitly entered kernel options to override them. This is the equivalent of the lilo(8)
               "append" option.

       label label
         kernel image
         append options ...
              Indicates that if label is entered as the kernel to boot, syslinux should instead boot image, and  the
              specified  "append"  options should be used instead of the ones specified in the global section of the
              file (before the first "label" command.) The default for image  is  the  same  as  label,  and  if  no
              "append"  is  given the default is to use the global entry (if any).  Use "append -" to use no options
              at all.  Up to 128 "label" entries are permitted.

                     The "image" doesn't have to be a Linux kernel; it can be a boot sector or a COMBOOT  file  (see
                     below.)

       implicit flag_val
              If  flag_val  is 0, do not load a kernel image unless it has been explicitly named in a "label" state‐
              ment.  The default is 1.

       timeout timeout
              Indicates how long to wait at the "boot:" prompt until booting automatically, in units of 1/10 s.  The
              timeout is cancelled as soon as the user types anything on the keyboard, the assumption being that the
              user will complete the command line already begun. A timeout of zero will  disable  the  timeout  com‐
              pletely,  this is also the default. The maximum possible timeout value is 35996; corresponding to just
              below one hour.

       serial port [ baudrate ]
              Enables a serial port to act as the console. "port" is a number (0 =  /dev/ttyS0  =  COM1,  etc.);  if
              "baudrate"  is omitted, the baud rate defaults to 9600 bps.  The serial parameters are hardcoded to be
              8 bits, no parity, 1 stop bit.

              For this directive to be guaranteed to work properly, it should be the first directive in the configu‐
              ration file.

       font filename
              Load a font in .psf format before displaying any output (except the copyright line, which is output as
              ldlinux.sys itself is loaded.) syslinux only loads the font onto the video card; if the .psf file con‐
              tains  a  Unicode  table  it is ignored.  This only works on EGA and VGA cards; hopefully it should do
              nothing on others.

       kbdmap keymap
              Install a simple keyboard map. The keyboard remapper used is very simplistic  (it  simply  remaps  the
              keycodes  received  from  the BIOS, which means that only the key combinations relevant in the default
              layout - usually U.S.  English - can be mapped) but should at least help people with  AZERTY  keyboard
              layout  and  the locations of = and , (two special characters used heavily on the Linux kernel command
              line.)

              The included program keytab-lilo.pl(8) from the lilo(8)
               distribution can be used to create such keymaps.

       display filename
              Displays the indicated file on the screen at boot time (before the boot: prompt, if displayed). Please
              see the section below on DISPLAY files. If the file is missing, this option is simply ignored.

       prompt flag_val
              If  flag_val is 0, display the "boot:" prompt only if the Shift or Alt key is pressed, or Caps Lock or
              Scroll lock is set (this is the default).  If flag_val is 1, always display the "boot:" prompt.

       f1 filename
       f2 filename
       ...
       f9 filename
       f10 filename
       f11 filename
       f12 filename
              Displays the indicated file on the screen when a function key is pressed at the "boot:"  prompt.  This
              can be used to implement pre-boot online help (presumably for the kernel command line options.)

              When using the serial console, press <Ctrl-F><digit> to get to the help screens, e.g. <Ctrl-F>2 to get
              to the f2 screen.  For f10-f12, hit <Ctrl-F>A, <Ctrl-F>B, <Ctrl-F>C.  For  compatiblity  with  earlier
              versions, f10 can also be entered as <Ctrl-F>0.

   Display file format
       DISPLAY  and  function-key  help files are text files in either DOS or UNIX format (with or without <CR>). In
       addition, the following special codes are interpreted:

       <FF> = <Ctrl-L> = ASCII 12
              Clear the screen, home the cursor.  Note that the screen is filled with the current display color.

       <SI><bg><fg>, <SI> = <Ctrl-O> = ASCII 15
              Set the display colors to the specified background and foreground colors, where <bg> and <fg> are  hex
              digits, corresponding to the standard PC display attributes:

              0 = black          8 = dark grey
              1 = dark blue      9 = bright blue
              2 = dark green     a = bright green
              3 = dark cyan      b = bright cyan
              4 = dark red       c = bright red
              5 = dark purple    d = bright purple
              6 = brown          e = yellow
              7 = light grey     f = white

              Picking  a  bright  color (8-f) for the background results in the corresponding dark color (0-7), with
              the foreground flashing.

              colors are not visible over the serial console.

       <CAN>filename<newline>, <CAN> = <Ctrl-X> = ASCII 24
              If a VGA display is present, enter graphics mode and display the graphic  included  in  the  specified
              file.  The file format is an ad hoc format called LSS16; the included Perl program "ppmtolss16" can be
              used to produce these images.  This Perl program also includes the file format specification.

              The image is displayed in 640x480 16-color mode.  Once in graphics mode, the display  attributes  (set
              by <SI> code sequences) work slightly differently: the background color is ignored, and the foreground
              colors are the 16 colors specified in the image file.  For that reason, ppmtolss16 allows you to spec‐
              ify that certain colors should be assigned to specific color indicies.

              Color indicies 0 and 7, in particular, should be chosen with care: 0 is the background color, and 7 is
              the color used for the text printed by SYSLINUX itself.

       <EM>, <EM> = <Ctrl-U> = ASCII 25
              If we are currently in graphics mode, return to text mode.

       <DLE>..<ETB>, <Ctrl-P>..<Ctrl-W> = ASCII 16-23
              These codes can be used to select which modes to print a certain part of the message file in.  Each of
              these  control  characters  select a specific set of modes (text screen, graphics screen, serial port)
              for which the output is actually displayed:

              Character                       Text    Graph   Serial
              ------------------------------------------------------
              <DLE> = <Ctrl-P> = ASCII 16     No      No      No
              <DC1> = <Ctrl-Q> = ASCII 17     Yes     No      No
              <DC2> = <Ctrl-R> = ASCII 18     No      Yes     No
              <DC3> = <Ctrl-S> = ASCII 19     Yes     Yes     No
              <DC4> = <Ctrl-T> = ASCII 20     No      No      Yes
              <NAK> = <Ctrl-U> = ASCII 21     Yes     No      Yes
              <SYN> = <Ctrl-V> = ASCII 22     No      Yes     Yes
              <ETB> = <Ctrl-W> = ASCII 23     Yes     Yes     Yes

              For example:
              <DC1>Text mode<DC2>Graphics mode<DC4>Serial port<ETB>
               ... will actually print out which mode the console is in!

       <SUB> = <Ctrl-Z> = ASCII 26
              End of file (DOS convention).

   Comboot Images and other operating systems
       This version of syslinux supports chain loading of other operating systems (such as MS-DOS  and  its  deriva‐
       tives, including Windows 95/98), as well as COMBOOT-style standalone executables (a subset of DOS .COM files;
       see separate section below.)

       Chain loading requires the boot sector of the foreign operating system to be stored in a  file  in  the  root
       directory of the filesystem.  Because neither Linux kernels, boot sector images, nor COMBOOT files have reli‐
       able magic numbers, syslinux will look at the file extension. The following extensions are recognised:

       none or other    Linux kernel image
       CBT              COMBOOT image (not runnable from DOS)
       BSS              Boot sector (DOS superblock will be patched in)
       BS               Boot sector
       COM              COMBOOT image (runnable from DOS)

       For filenames given on the command line, syslinux will search for the file by adding extensions in the  order
       listed above if the plain filename is not found. Filenames in KERNEL statements must be fully qualified.

       A  COMBOOT  file  is a standalone executable in DOS .COM format. They can, among other things, be produced by
       the Etherboot package by Markus Gutschke and Ken Yap. The following requirements apply for these files to  be
       sufficiently "standalone" for syslinux to be able to load and run them:

       ·      The program must not execute any DOS calls (since there is no DOS), although it may call the BIOS. The
              only exception is that the program may execute INT 20h (Terminate Program) to return to  the  syslinux
              prompt. Note especially that INT 21h AH=4Ch, INT 21h AH=31h or INT 27h are not supported.

       ·      Only  the  fields  pspInt20 at offset 00h, pspNextParagraph at offset 02h and pspCommandTail at offset
              80h (contains the arguments from the syslinux command line) in the PSP are supported. All other fields
              will contain zero.

       ·      The  program must not modify any main memory outside its 64K segment if it returns to syslinux via INT
              20h.

       Syslinux currently doesn't provide any form of API for the use of COMBOOT files.  If there is need, a  future
       version  may  contain  an  INT  interface to some syslinux functions; please contact me if you have a need or
       ideas for such an API.

   Novice protection
       Syslinux will attempt to detect if the user is trying to boot on a 286 or lower class machine, or  a  machine
       with  less than 608K of low ("DOS") RAM (which means the Linux boot sequence cannot complete).  If so, a mes‐
       sage is displayed and the boot sequence aborted.  Holding down the Ctrl key while booting disables this  fea‐
       ture.

       The  compile  time  and  date  of  a  specific  syslinux  version  can  be  obtained by the DOS command "type
       ldlinux.sys". This is also used as the signature for the LDLINUX.SYS file, which must match the boot sector

       Any file that syslinux uses can be marked hidden, system or readonly if so is  convenient;  syslinux  ignores
       all file attributes.  The SYSLINUX installed automatically sets the readonly attribute on LDLINUX.SYS.

   Bootable CD-ROMs
       SYSLINUX can be used to create bootdisk images for El Torito-compatible bootable CD-ROMs. However, it appears
       that many BIOSes are very buggy when it comes to booting CD-ROMs. Some users have reported that the following
       steps are helpful in making a CD-ROM that is bootable on the largest possible number of machines:

       ·      Use the -s (safe, slow and stupid) option to SYSLINUX

       ·      Put the boot image as close to the beginning of the ISO 9660 filesystem as possible.

       A CD-ROM is so much faster than a floppy that the -s option shouldn't matter from a speed perspective.

       Of course, you probably want to use ISOLINUX instead.  See the documentation file isolinux.doc.

   Booting from a FAT partition on a hard disk
       SYSLINUX  can  boot from a FAT filesystem partition on a hard disk (including FAT32). The installation proce‐
       dure is identical to the procedure for installing it on a floppy, and should work under either DOS or  Linux.
       To  boot  from  a  partition, SYSLINUX needs to be launched from a Master Boot Record or another boot loader,
       just like DOS itself would. A sample master boot sector (mbr.bin) is included with SYSLINUX.

BUGS
       I would appreciate hearing of any problems you have with SYSLINUX.  I would also like to hear from you if you
       have successfully used SYSLINUX, especially if you are using it for a distribution.

       If  you  are reporting problems, please include all possible information about your system and your BIOS; the
       vast majority of all problems reported turn out to be BIOS or hardware bugs, and I need as  much  information
       as possible in order to diagnose the problems.

       There  is  a mailing list for discussion among SYSLINUX users and for announcements of new and test versions.
       To join, send a message to majordomo@linux.kernel.org with the line:

       subscribe syslinux

       in the body of the message. The submission address is syslinux@linux.kernel.org.
