NAME
       lpstat - print cups status information

SYNOPSIS
       lpstat  [ -E ] [ -H ] [ -U username ] [ -h hostname[:port] ] [ -l ] [ -W which-jobs ] [ -a [ destination(s) ]
       ] [ -c [ class(es) ] ] [ -d ] [ -o [ destination(s) ] ] [ -p [ printer(s) ] ] [ -r ] [ -R ] [ -s ] [ -t  ]  [

DESCRIPTION
       lpstat displays status information about the current classes, jobs, and printers. When run with no arguments,
       lpstat will list jobs queued by the current user.

OPTIONS
       The lpstat command supports the following options:

       -E
            Forces encryption when connecting to the server.

       -H
            Shows the server hostname and port.

       -R
            Shows the ranking of print jobs.

       -U username
            Specifies an alternate username.

       -W which-jobs
            Specifies which jobs to show, completed or not-completed (the default). This option must  appear  before
            the  -o option and/or any printer names, otherwise the default (not-completed) value will be used in the
            request to the scheduler.

       -a [printer(s)]
            Shows the accepting state of printer queues. If no printers are specified then all printers are listed.

       -c [class(es)]
            Shows the printer classes and the printers that belong to them.  If no classes are  specified  then  all
            classes are listed.

       -d
            Shows the current default destination.

       -h server[:port]
            Specifies an alternate server.

       -l
            Shows a long listing of printers, classes, or jobs.

       -o [destination(s)]
            Shows the jobs queue on the specified destinations. If no destinations are specified all jobs are shown.

       -p [printer(s)]
            Shows  the  printers and whether or not they are enabled for printing. If no printers are specified then
            all printers are listed.

       -r
            Shows whether the CUPS server is running.

       -s
            Shows a status summary, including the default destination, a list of classes and their member  printers,
            and  a  list  of  printers and their associated devices. This is equivalent to using the "-d", "-c", and
            "-v" options.

       -t
            Shows all status information. This is equivalent to using the "-r", "-d", "-c", "-v",  "-a",  "-p",  and
            "-o" options.

       -u [user(s)]
            Shows  a  list  of  print  jobs queued by the specified users. If no users are specified, lists the jobs
            queued by the current user.

       -v [printer(s)]
            Shows the printers and what device they are attached to. If no printers are specified then all  printers
            are listed.

COMPATIBILITY
       Unlike  the  System  V  printing  system, CUPS allows printer names to contain any printable character except
       SPACE, TAB, "/", and "#".  Also, printer and class names are not case-sensitive.

       The "-h", "-E", "-U", and "-W" options are unique to CUPS.

       The Solaris "-f", "-P", and "-S" options are silently ignored.
