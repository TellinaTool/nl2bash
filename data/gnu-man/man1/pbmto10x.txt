NAME
       pbmto10x - convert a portable bitmap into Gemini 10X printer graphics

SYNOPSIS
       pbmto10x [-h] [pbmfile]

DESCRIPTION
       Reads  a  portable  bitmap  as  input.   Produces a file of Gemini 10X printer graphics as output.  The 10x's
       printer codes are alleged to be similar to the Epson codes.

       Note that there is no 10xtopbm tool - this transformation is one way.

OPTIONS
       The resolution is normally 60H by 72V.  If the -h flag is specified, resolution is 120H  by  144V.   You  may
       find it useful to rotate landscape images before printing.
