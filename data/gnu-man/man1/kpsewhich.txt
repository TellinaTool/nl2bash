NAME
       kpsewhich - standalone path lookup and and expansion for kpathsea

SYNOPSIS
       kpsewhich [options] [filenames]

DESCRIPTION
       This  manual  page  is not meant to be exhaustive.  The complete documentation for this version of TeX can be
       found in the info file or manual Kpathsea: A library for path searching.

       kpsewhich is used as a standalone front-end of the kpathsea library that can be used to examine variables and
       find  files.   When the -format option is not given, the search path used when looking for a file is inferred
       from the name given, by looking for a known extension.  If no known extension is found, the search  path  for
       TeX source files is used.
