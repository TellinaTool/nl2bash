NAME
       bc - An arbitrary precision calculator language

SYNTAX
       bc [ -hlwsqv ] [long-options] [  file ... ]

DESCRIPTION
       bc  is  a language that supports arbitrary precision numbers with interactive execution of statements.  There
       are some similarities in the syntax to the C programming language.  A standard math library is  available  by
       command  line  option.   If requested, the math library is defined before processing any files.  bc starts by
       processing code from all the files listed on the command line in the order listed.  After all files have been
       processed, bc reads from the standard input.  All code is executed as it is read.  (If a file contains a com‐
       mand to halt the processor, bc will never read from the standard input.)

       This version of bc contains several extensions beyond traditional bc  implementations  and  the  POSIX  draft
       standard.   Command line options can cause these extensions to print a warning or to be rejected.  This docu‐
       ment describes the language accepted by this processor.  Extensions will be identified as such.

   NUMBERS
       The most basic element in bc is the number.  Numbers are arbitrary precision numbers.  This precision is both
       in  the integer part and the fractional part.  All numbers are represented internally in decimal and all com‐
       putation is done in decimal.  (This version truncates results from divide and  multiply  operations.)   There
       are two attributes of numbers, the length and the scale.  The length is the total number of significant deci‐
       mal digits in a number and the scale is the total number of decimal digits  after  the  decimal  point.   For
       example:
               .000001 has a length of 6 and scale of 6.
               1935.000 has a length of 7 and a scale of 3.

   VARIABLES
       Numbers  are  stored in two types of variables, simple variables and arrays.  Both simple variables and array
       variables are named.  Names begin with a letter followed by any number of letters,  digits  and  underscores.
       All letters must be lower case.  (Full alpha-numeric names are an extension. In POSIX bc all names are a sin‐
       gle lower case letter.)  The type of variable is clear by the context because all array variable  names  will
       be followed by brackets ([]).

       There  are four special variables, scale, ibase, obase, and last.  scale defines how some operations use dig‐
       its after the decimal point.  The default value of scale is 0. ibase and obase define the conversion base for
       input  and output numbers.  The default for both input and output is base 10.  last (an extension) is a vari‐
       able that has the value of the last printed number.  These will be discussed in further detail  where  appro‐
       priate.  All of these variables may have values assigned to them as well as used in expressions.

   COMMENTS
       Comments  in bc start with the characters /* and end with the characters */.  Comments may start anywhere and
       appear as a single space in the input.  (This causes comments to delimit other input items.  For  example,  a
       comment  can  not  be  found  in the middle of a variable name.)  Comments include any newlines (end of line)
       between the start and the end of the comment.

       To support the use of scripts for bc, a single line comment has been added as an extension.   A  single  line
       comment  starts at a # character and continues to the next end of the line.  The end of line character is not
       part of the comment and is processed normally.

   EXPRESSIONS
       The numbers are manipulated by expressions and statements.  Since the language was designed  to  be  interac‐
       tive,  statements  and  expressions  are executed as soon as possible.  There is no "main" program.  Instead,
       code is executed as it is encountered.  (Functions, discussed in detail later, are defined when encountered.)

       A simple expression is just a constant. bc converts constants into internal decimal numbers using the current
       input base, specified by the variable ibase. (There is an exception in functions.)  The legal values of ibase
       are 2 through 16.  Assigning a value outside this range to ibase will result in a value of 2  or  16.   Input
       numbers  may  contain the characters 0-9 and A-F. (Note: They must be capitals.  Lower case letters are vari‐
       able names.)  Single digit numbers always have the value of the digit regardless of the value of ibase. (i.e.
       A  =  10.)   For  multi-digit  numbers, bc changes all input digits greater or equal to ibase to the value of
       ibase-1.  This makes the number FFF always be the largest 3 digit number of the input base.

       Full expressions are similar to many other high level languages.  Since there is only  one  kind  of  number,
       there are no rules for mixing types.  Instead, there are rules on the scale of expressions.  Every expression
       has a scale.  This is derived from the scale of original numbers, the operation performed and in many  cases,
       the value of the variable scale. Legal values of the variable scale are 0 to the maximum number representable
       by a C integer.

       In the following descriptions of legal expressions, "expr" refers to a complete expression and  "var"  refers
       to a simple or an array variable.  A simple variable is just a
              name
       and an array variable is specified as
              name[expr]
       Unless specifically mentioned the scale of the result is the maximum scale of the expressions involved.

       - expr The result is the negation of the expression.

       ++ var The variable is incremented by one and the new value is the result of the expression.

       -- var The variable is decremented by one and the new value is the result of the expression.

       var ++
               The  result  of  the  expression is the value of the variable and then the variable is incremented by
              one.

       var -- The result of the expression is the value of the variable and then the variable is decremented by one.

       expr + expr
              The result of the expression is the sum of the two expressions.

       expr - expr
              The result of the expression is the difference of the two expressions.

       expr * expr
              The result of the expression is the product of the two expressions.

       expr / expr
              The result of the expression is the quotient of the two expressions.  The scale of the result  is  the
              value of the variable scale.

       expr % expr
              The  result  of the expression is the "remainder" and it is computed in the following way.  To compute
              a%b, first a/b is computed to scale digits.  That result is used to compute a-(a/b)*b to the scale  of
              the maximum of scale+scale(b) and scale(a).  If scale is set to zero and both expressions are integers
              this expression is the integer remainder function.

       expr ^ expr
              The result of the expression is the value of the first raised to the  second.  The  second  expression
              must  be  an  integer.   (If  the  second expression is not an integer, a warning is generated and the
              expression is truncated to get an integer value.)  The scale of the result is scale if the exponent is
              negative.   If  the  exponent  is  positive the scale of the result is the minimum of the scale of the
              first expression times the value of the exponent and the maximum of scale and the scale of  the  first
              expression.   (e.g.  scale(a^b)  =  min(scale(a)*b,  max( scale, scale(a))).)  It should be noted that
              expr^0 will always return the value of 1.

       ( expr )
              This alters the standard precedence to force the evaluation of the expression.

       var = expr
              The variable is assigned the value of the expression.

       var <op>= expr
              This is equivalent to "var = var <op> expr" with the exception that the "var" part is  evaluated  only
              once.  This can make a difference if "var" is an array.

       Relational  expressions are a special kind of expression that always evaluate to 0 or 1, 0 if the relation is
       false and 1 if the relation is true.  These may appear in any legal  expression.   (POSIX  bc  requires  that
       relational  expressions  are used only in if, while, and for statements and that only one relational test may
       be done in them.)  The relational operators are

       expr1 < expr2
              The result is 1 if expr1 is strictly less than expr2.

       expr1 <= expr2
              The result is 1 if expr1 is less than or equal to expr2.

       expr1 > expr2
              The result is 1 if expr1 is strictly greater than expr2.

       expr1 >= expr2
              The result is 1 if expr1 is greater than or equal to expr2.

       expr1 == expr2
              The result is 1 if expr1 is equal to expr2.

       expr1 != expr2
              The result is 1 if expr1 is not equal to expr2.

       Boolean operations are also legal.  (POSIX bc does NOT have boolean operations). The result  of  all  boolean
       operations are 0 and 1 (for false and true) as in relational expressions.  The boolean operators are:

       !expr  The result is 1 if expr is 0.

       expr && expr
              The result is 1 if both expressions are non-zero.

       expr || expr
              The result is 1 if either expression is non-zero.

       The expression precedence is as follows: (lowest to highest)
              || operator, left associative
              && operator, left associative
              ! operator, nonassociative
              Relational operators, left associative
              Assignment operator, right associative
              + and - operators, left associative
              *, / and % operators, left associative
              ^ operator, right associative
              unary - operator, nonassociative
              ++ and -- operators, nonassociative

       This precedence was chosen so that POSIX compliant bc programs will run correctly. This will cause the use of
       the relational and logical operators to have some unusual behavior when  used  with  assignment  expressions.
       Consider the expression:
              a = 3 < 5

       Most  C  programmers  would assume this would assign the result of "3 < 5" (the value 1) to the variable "a".
       What this does in bc is assign the value 3 to the variable "a" and then compare 3 to 5.  It is  best  to  use
       parenthesis when using relational and logical operators with the assignment operators.

       There  are  a few more special expressions that are provided in bc.  These have to do with user defined func‐
       tions and standard functions.  They all appear as "name(parameters)".  See the section on functions for  user
       defined functions.  The standard functions are:

       length ( expression )
              The value of the length function is the number of significant digits in the expression.

       read ( )
              The  read  function (an extension) will read a number from the standard input, regardless of where the
              function occurs.   Beware, this can cause problems with the mixing of data and program in the standard
              input.   The  best  use for this function is in a previously written program that needs input from the
              user, but never allows program code to be input from the user.  The value of the read function is  the
              number  read  from the standard input using the current value of the variable ibase for the conversion
              base.

       scale ( expression )
              The value of the scale function is the number of digits after the decimal point in the expression.

       sqrt ( expression )
              The value of the sqrt function is the square root of the expression.  If the expression is negative, a
              run time error is generated.

   STATEMENTS
       Statements  (as  in  most algebraic languages) provide the sequencing of expression evaluation.  In bc state‐
       ments are executed "as soon as possible."  Execution happens when a newline in encountered and there  is  one
       or  more  complete  statements.  Due to this immediate execution, newlines are very important in bc. In fact,
       both a semicolon and a newline are used as statement separators.  An improperly placed newline will  cause  a
       syntax error.  Because newlines are statement separators, it is possible to hide a newline by using the back‐
       slash character.  The sequence "\<nl>", where <nl> is the newline appears to bc as whitespace  instead  of  a
       newline.   A statement list is a series of statements separated by semicolons and newlines.  The following is
       a list of bc statements and what they do: (Things enclosed in brackets ([]) are optional parts of the  state‐
       ment.)

       expression
              This  statement  does one of two things.  If the expression starts with "<variable> <assignment> ...",
              it is considered to be an assignment statement.  If the expression is not an assignment statement, the
              expression is evaluated and printed to the output.  After the number is printed, a newline is printed.
              For example, "a=1" is an assignment statement and "(a=1)"  is  an  expression  that  has  an  embedded
              assignment.  All numbers that are printed are printed in the base specified by the variable obase. The
              legal values for obase are 2 through BC_BASE_MAX.  (See the section LIMITS.)  For bases 2 through  16,
              the  usual  method  of  writing numbers is used.  For bases greater than 16, bc uses a multi-character
              digit method of printing the numbers where each higher base digit is printed as a base 10 number.  The
              multi-character digits are separated by spaces.  Each digit contains the number of characters required
              to represent the base ten value of "obase-1".  Since numbers are of arbitrary precision, some  numbers
              may not be printable on a single output line.  These long numbers will be split across lines using the
              "\" as the last character on a line.  The maximum number of characters printed per line is 70.  Due to
              the  interactive nature of bc, printing a number causes the side effect of assigning the printed value
              to the special variable last. This allows the user to recover the last value printed without having to
              retype the expression that printed the number.  Assigning to last is legal and will overwrite the last
              printed value with the assigned value.  The newly assigned value will remain until the next number  is
              printed  or  another  value  is  assigned  to last.  (Some installations may allow the use of a single
              period (.) which is not part of a number as a short hand notation for for last.)

       string The string is printed to the output.  Strings start with a double  quote  character  and  contain  all
              characters  until  the  next double quote character.  All characters are take literally, including any
              newline.  No newline character is printed after the string.

       print list
              The print statement (an extension) provides another method of output.  The "list" is a list of strings
              and  expressions  separated by commas.  Each string or expression is printed in the order of the list.
              No terminating newline is printed.  Expressions are evaluated and their value is printed and  assigned
              to the variable last. Strings in the print statement are printed to the output and may contain special
              characters.  Special characters start with the backslash character (\).  The special characters recog‐
              nized  by  bc  are "a" (alert or bell), "b" (backspace), "f" (form feed), "n" (newline), "r" (carriage
              return), "q" (double quote), "t" (tab), and "\" (backslash).  Any other character following the  back‐
              slash will be ignored.

       { statement_list }
              This is the compound statement.  It allows multiple statements to be grouped together for execution.

       if ( expression ) statement1 [else statement2]
              The if statement evaluates the expression and executes statement1 or statement2 depending on the value
              of the expression.  If the expression is non-zero, statement1 is executed.  If statement2  is  present
              and the value of the expression is 0, then statement2 is executed.  (The else clause is an extension.)

       while ( expression ) statement
              The  while  statement  will  execute the statement while the expression is non-zero.  It evaluates the
              expression before each execution of the statement.   Termination of the  loop  is  caused  by  a  zero
              expression value or the execution of a break statement.

       for ( [expression1] ; [expression2] ; [expression3] ) statement
              The  for  statement controls repeated execution of the statement.  Expression1 is evaluated before the
              loop.  Expression2 is evaluated before each execution of the statement.  If it is non-zero, the state‐
              ment  is  evaluated.   If  it is zero, the loop is terminated.  After each execution of the statement,
              expression3 is evaluated before the reevaluation of expression2.  If expression1  or  expression3  are
              missing,  nothing is evaluated at the point they would be evaluated.  If expression2 is missing, it is
              the same as substituting the value 1 for expression2.  (The optional  expressions  are  an  extension.
              POSIX bc requires all three expressions.)  The following is equivalent code for the for statement:
              expression1;
              while (expression2) {
                 statement;
                 expression3;
              }

       break  This statement causes a forced exit of the most recent enclosing while statement or for statement.

       continue
              The  continue  statement  (an  extension)  causes the most recent enclosing for statement to start the
              next iteration.

       halt   The halt statement (an extension) is an executed statement that causes the bc processor to  quit  only
              when  it is executed.  For example, "if (0 == 1) halt" will not cause bc to terminate because the halt
              is not executed.

       return Return the value 0 from a function.  (See the section on functions.)

       return ( expression )
              Return the value of the expression from a function.  (See the section on functions.)  As an extension,
              the parenthesis are not required.

   PSEUDO STATEMENTS
       These statements are not statements in the traditional sense.  They are not executed statements.  Their func‐
       tion is performed at "compile" time.

       limits Print the local limits enforced by the local version of bc.  This is an extension.

       quit   When the quit statement is read, the bc processor is terminated, regardless of where the  quit  state‐
              ment is found.  For example, "if (0 == 1) quit" will cause bc to terminate.

       warranty
              Print a longer warranty notice.  This is an extension.

   FUNCTIONS
       Functions provide a method of defining a computation that can be executed later.  Functions in bc always com‐
       pute a value and return it to the caller.  Function definitions are "dynamic" in the sense that a function is
       undefined until a definition is encountered in the input.  That definition is then used until another defini‐
       tion function for the same name is encountered.  The new definition then replaces the  older  definition.   A
       function is defined as follows:
              define name ( parameters ) { newline
                  auto_list   statement_list }
       A function call is just an expression of the form "name(parameters)".

       Parameters  are  numbers  or  arrays (an extension).  In the function definition, zero or more parameters are
       defined by listing their names separated by commas.  All parameters are call by value parameters.  Arrays are
       specified in the parameter definition by the notation "name[]".   In the function call, actual parameters are
       full expressions for number parameters.  The same notation is used for passing arrays as for  defining  array
       parameters.   The  named  array  is passed by value to the function.  Since function definitions are dynamic,
       parameter numbers and types are checked when a function is called.  Any mismatch in number or types of param‐
       eters will cause a runtime error.  A runtime error will also occur for the call to an undefined function.

       The  auto_list  is  an  optional list of variables that are for "local" use.  The syntax of the auto list (if
       present) is "auto name, ... ;".  (The semicolon is optional.)  Each name is the name  of  an  auto  variable.
       Arrays  may be specified by using the same notation as used in parameters.  These variables have their values
       pushed onto a stack at the start of the function.  The variables  are  then  initialized  to  zero  and  used
       throughout  the execution of the function.  At function exit, these variables are popped so that the original
       value (at the time of the function call) of these variables are restored.  The  parameters  are  really  auto
       variables  that  are initialized to a value provided in the function call.  Auto variables are different than
       traditional local variables because if function A calls function B, B may access function A's auto  variables
       by  just  using  the  same name, unless function B has called them auto variables.  Due to the fact that auto
       variables and parameters are pushed onto a stack, bc supports recursive functions.

       The function body is a list of bc statements.  Again, statements are separated  by  semicolons  or  newlines.
       Return  statements  cause the termination of a function and the return of a value.  There are two versions of
       the return statement.  The first form, "return", returns the value 0 to the calling expression.   The  second
       form,  "return  (  expression  )", computes the value of the expression and returns that value to the calling
       expression.  There is an implied "return (0)" at the end of every function.  This allows a function to termi‐
       nate and return 0 without an explicit return statement.

       Functions  also change the usage of the variable ibase.  All constants in the function body will be converted
       using the value of ibase at the time of the function call.  Changes of ibase will be ignored during the  exe‐
       cution  of  the  function  except  for the standard function read, which will always use the current value of
       ibase for conversion of numbers.

       Several extensions have been added to functions.  First, the format  of  the  definition  has  been  slightly
       relaxed.   The  standard  requires  the opening brace be on the same line as the define keyword and all other
       parts must be on following lines.  This version of bc will allow any number of newlines before and after  the
       opening brace of the function.  For example, the following definitions are legal.
              define d (n) { return (2*n); }
              define d (n)
                { return (2*n); }

       Functions may be defined as void.  A void funtion returns no value and thus may not be used in any place that
       needs a value.  A void function does not produce any output when called by itself on an input line.  The  key
       word  void  is placed between the key word define and the function name.  For example, consider the following
       session.
              define py (y) { print "--->", y, "<---", "0; }
              define void px (x) { print "--->", x, "<---", "0; }
              py(1)
              --->1<---
              0
              px(1)
              --->1<---
       Since py is not a void function, the call of py(1) prints the desired output and then prints  a  second  line
       that is the value of the function.  Since the value of a function that is not given an explicit return state‐
       ment is zero, the zero is printed.  For px(1), no zero is printed because the function is a void function.

       Also, call by variable for arrays was added.  To declare a call by variable array,  the  declaration  of  the
       array  parameter  in the function definition looks like "*name[]".  The call to the function remains the same
       as call by value arrays.

   MATH LIBRARY
       If bc is invoked with the -l option, a math library is preloaded and the default scale is set  to  20.    The
       math  functions  will  calculate  their results to the scale set at the time of their call.  The math library
       defines the following functions:

       s (x)  The sine of x, x is in radians.

       c (x)  The cosine of x, x is in radians.

       a (x)  The arctangent of x, arctangent returns radians.

       l (x)  The natural logarithm of x.

       e (x)  The exponential function of raising e to the value x.

       j (n,x)
              The Bessel function of integer order n of x.

   EXAMPLES
       In /bin/sh,  the following will assign the value of "pi" to the shell variable pi.
               pi=$(echo "scale=10; 4*a(1)" | bc -l)

       The following is the definition of the exponential function used in the math library.  This function is writ‐
       ten in POSIX bc.
              scale = 20

              /* Uses the fact that e^x = (e^(x/2))^2
                 When x is small enough, we use the series:
                   e^x = 1 + x + x^2/2! + x^3/3! + ...
              */

              define e(x) {
                auto  a, d, e, f, i, m, v, z

                /* Check the sign of x. */
                if (x<0) {
                  m = 1
                  x = -x
                }

                /* Precondition x. */
                z = scale;
                scale = 4 + z + .44*x;
                while (x > 1) {
                  f += 1;
                  x /= 2;
                }

                /* Initialize the variables. */
                v = 1+x
                a = x
                d = 1

                for (i=2; 1; i++) {
                  e = (a *= x) / (d *= i)
                  if (e == 0) {
                    if (f>0) while (f--)  v = v*v;
                    scale = z
                    if (m) return (1/v);
                    return (v/1);
                  }
                  v += e
                }
              }

       The  following  is  code  that uses the extended features of bc to implement a simple program for calculating
       checkbook balances.  This program is best kept in a file so that it can be used many times without having  to
       retype it at every use.
              scale=2
              print "\nCheck book program!\n"
              print "  Remember, deposits are negative transactions.\n"
              print "  Exit by a 0 transaction.\n\n"

              print "Initial balance? "; bal = read()
              bal /= 1
              print "\n"
              while (1) {
                "current balance = "; bal
                "transaction? "; trans = read()
                if (trans == 0) break;
                bal -= trans
                bal /= 1
              }
              quit

       The following is the definition of the recursive factorial function.
              define f (x) {
                if (x <= 1) return (1);
                return (f(x-1) * x);
              }

   READLINE AND LIBEDIT OPTIONS
       GNU  bc  can  be  compiled  (via  a configure option) to use the GNU readline input editor library or the BSD
       libedit library.  This allows the user to do editing of lines before sending them to bc.  It also allows  for
       a  history  of  previous  lines typed.  When this option is selected, bc has one more special variable.  This
       special variable, history is the number of lines of history retained.  For readline, a value of -1 means that
       an  unlimited  number  of  history  lines  are  retained.   Setting the value of history to a positive number
       restricts the number of history lines to the number given.  The value of 0 disables the history feature.  The
       default  value  is  100.  For  more  information, read the user manuals for the GNU readline, history and BSD
       libedit libraries.  One can not enable both readline and libedit at the same time.

   DIFFERENCES
       This version of bc was implemented from the POSIX P1003.2/D11 draft  and  contains  several  differences  and
       extensions  relative  to the draft and traditional implementations.  It is not implemented in the traditional
       way using dc(1).  This version is a single process which parses and runs a byte code translation of the  pro‐
       gram.  There is an "undocumented" option (-c) that causes the program to output the byte code to the standard
       output instead of running it.  It was mainly used for debugging the parser and preparing the math library.

       A major source of differences is extensions, where a feature is extended to add more functionality and  addi‐
       tions, where new features are added.  The following is the list of differences and extensions.

       LANG environment
              This version does not conform to the POSIX standard in the processing of the LANG environment variable
              and all environment variables starting with LC_.

       names  Traditional and POSIX bc have single letter names for functions, variables and arrays.  They have been
              extended to be multi-character names that start with a letter and may contain letters, numbers and the
              underscore character.

       Strings
              Strings are not allowed to contain NUL characters.  POSIX says all  characters  must  be  included  in
              strings.

       last   POSIX  bc  does  not have a last variable.  Some implementations of bc use the period (.) in a similar
              way.

       comparisons
              POSIX bc allows comparisons only in the if statement, the while statement, and the  second  expression
              of the for statement.  Also, only one relational operation is allowed in each of those statements.

       if statement, else clause
              POSIX bc does not have an else clause.

       for statement
              POSIX bc requires all expressions to be present in the for statement.

       &&, ||, !
              POSIX bc does not have the logical operators.

       read function
              POSIX bc does not have a read function.

       print statement
              POSIX bc does not have a print statement .

       continue statement
              POSIX bc does not have a continue statement.

       return statement
              POSIX bc requires parentheses around the return expression.

       array parameters
              POSIX  bc  does not (currently) support array parameters in full.  The POSIX grammar allows for arrays
              in function definitions, but does not provide a method to specify an array  as  an  actual  parameter.
              (This  is  most likely an oversight in the grammar.)  Traditional implementations of bc have only call
              by value array parameters.

       function format
              POSIX bc requires the opening brace on the same line as the define key word and the auto statement  on
              the next line.

       =+, =-, =*, =/, =%, =^
              POSIX  bc  does  not  require  these "old style" assignment operators to be defined.  This version may
              allow these "old style" assignments.  Use the limits statement to see if the  installed  version  sup‐
              ports  them.   If  it  does  support the "old style" assignment operators, the statement "a =- 1" will
              decrement a by 1 instead of setting a to the value -1.

       spaces in numbers
              Other implementations of bc allow spaces in numbers.  For example, "x=1 3" would assign the  value  13
              to the variable x.  The same statement would cause a syntax error in this version of bc.

       errors and execution
              This implementation varies from other implementations in terms of what code will be executed when syn‐
              tax and other errors are found in the program.  If a syntax error is found in a  function  definition,
              error  recovery tries to find the beginning of a statement and continue to parse the function.  Once a
              syntax error is found in the function, the function will not be callable and becomes undefined.   Syn‐
              tax  errors in the interactive execution code will invalidate the current execution block.  The execu‐
              tion block is terminated by an end of line that appears after a complete sequence of statements.   For
              example,
              a = 1
              b = 2
       has two execution blocks and
              { a = 1
                b = 2 }
       has  one  execution block.  Any runtime error will terminate the execution of the current execution block.  A
       runtime warning will not terminate the current execution block.

       Interrupts
              During an interactive session, the SIGINT signal (usually generated by the  control-C  character  from
              the  terminal) will cause execution of the current execution block to be interrupted.  It will display
              a "runtime" error indicating which function was interrupted.  After all runtime structures  have  been
              cleaned  up, a message will be printed to notify the user that bc is ready for more input.  All previ‐
              ously defined functions remain defined and the value of all non-auto variables are the  value  at  the
              point  of  interruption.   All  auto variables and function parameters are removed during the clean up
              process.  During a non-interactive session, the SIGINT signal will terminate the entire run of bc.

   LIMITS
       The following are the limits currently in place for this bc processor.  Some of them may have been changed by
       an installation.  Use the limits statement to see the actual values.

       BC_BASE_MAX
              The maximum output base is currently set at 999.  The maximum input base is 16.

       BC_DIM_MAX
              This is currently an arbitrary limit of 65535 as distributed.  Your installation may be different.

       BC_SCALE_MAX
              The number of digits after the decimal point is limited to INT_MAX digits.  Also, the number of digits
              before the decimal point is limited to INT_MAX digits.

       BC_STRING_MAX
              The limit on the number of characters in a string is INT_MAX characters.

       exponent
              The value of the exponent in the raise operation (^) is limited to LONG_MAX.

       variable names
              The current limit on the number of unique names is 32767 for each  of  simple  variables,  arrays  and
              functions.

ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES
       The following environment variables are processed by bc:

       POSIXLY_CORRECT
              This is the same as the -s option.

       BC_ENV_ARGS
              This  is  another  mechanism to get arguments to bc.  The format is the same as the command line argu‐
              ments.  These arguments are processed first, so any files listed in the environment arguments are pro‐
              cessed  before any command line argument files.  This allows the user to set up "standard" options and
              files to be processed at every invocation of bc.  The files in the environment variables  would  typi‐
              cally contain function definitions for functions the user wants defined every time bc is run.

       BC_LINE_LENGTH
              This  should  be  an  integer  specifying the number of characters in an output line for numbers. This
              includes the backslash and newline characters for long numbers.  As an extension, the  value  of  zero
              disables  the  multi-line feature.  Any other value of this variable that is less than 3 sets the line
              length to 70.

DIAGNOSTICS
       If any file on the command line can not be opened, bc will report that the file is unavailable and terminate.
       Also, there are compile and run time diagnostics that should be self-explanatory.

BUGS
       Error recovery is not very good yet.
