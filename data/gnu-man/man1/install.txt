NAME
       install - copy files and set attributes

SYNOPSIS
       install [OPTION]... [-T] SOURCE DEST
       install [OPTION]... SOURCE... DIRECTORY
       install [OPTION]... -t DIRECTORY SOURCE...
       install [OPTION]... -d DIRECTORY...

DESCRIPTION
       This  install  program copies files (often just compiled) into destination locations you choose.  If you want
       to download and install a ready-to-use package on a GNU/Linux system, you should instead be using  a  package
       manager like yum(1) or apt-get(1).

       In  the first three forms, copy SOURCE to DEST or multiple SOURCE(s) to the existing DIRECTORY, while setting
       permission modes and owner/group.  In the 4th form, create all components of the given DIRECTORY(ies).

       Mandatory arguments to long options are mandatory for short options too.

       --backup[=CONTROL]
              make a backup of each existing destination file

       -b     like --backup but does not accept an argument

       -c     (ignored)

       -C, --compare
              compare each pair of source and destination files, and in some cases, do not modify the destination at
              all

       -d, --directory
              treat all arguments as directory names; create all components of the specified directories

       -D     create all leading components of DEST except the last, then copy SOURCE to DEST

       -g, --group=GROUP
              set group ownership, instead of process' current group

       -m, --mode=MODE
              set permission mode (as in chmod), instead of rwxr-xr-x

       -o, --owner=OWNER
              set ownership (super-user only)

       -p, --preserve-timestamps
              apply access/modification times of SOURCE files to corresponding destination files

       -s, --strip
              strip symbol tables

       --strip-program=PROGRAM
              program used to strip binaries

       -S, --suffix=SUFFIX
              override the usual backup suffix

       -t, --target-directory=DIRECTORY
              copy all SOURCE arguments into DIRECTORY

       -T, --no-target-directory
              treat DEST as a normal file

       -v, --verbose
              print the name of each directory as it is created

       --preserve-context
              preserve SELinux security context

       -Z, --context=CONTEXT
              set SELinux security context of files and directories

       --help display this help and exit

       --version
              output version information and exit

       The  backup  suffix is '~', unless set with --suffix or SIMPLE_BACKUP_SUFFIX.  The version control method may
       be selected via the --backup option or through the VERSION_CONTROL environment variable.  Here are  the  val‐
       ues:

       none, off
              never make backups (even if --backup is given)

       numbered, t
              make numbered backups

       existing, nil
              numbered if numbered backups exist, simple otherwise

       simple, never
              always make simple backups
