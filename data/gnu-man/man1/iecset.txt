NAME
       iecset - Set or dump IEC958 status bits


SYNOPSIS
       iecset [options] [cmd arg...]


DESCRIPTION
       iecset  is  a  small  utility  to set or dump the IEC958 (or so-called "S/PDIF") status bits of the specified
       sound card via ALSA control API.

       When iecset is started without arguments except for options, it will show the  current  IEC958  status  in  a
       human-readable  form.   When  the  commands are given in the arguments, they are parsed and the IEC958 status
       bits are updated.  The resultant status is shown as well.

       The commands consist of the command directive and the argument.  As the  boolean  argument,  yes,  no,  true,
       false, or a digit number is allowed.


EXAMPLES
       iecset -Dhw:1
              Displays the current IEC958 status bits on the second card.  This is equivalent with -c 1.

       iecset -x
              Displays  the  current  IEC958 status bits in a style of the arguments for the PCM stream.  The output
              string can be passed to the iec958 (or spdif) PCM type as the optional argument.

       iecset pro off audio off
              Sets the current status to the consumer-mode and turns on the non-audio bit.  The modified status will
              be shown, too.


OPTIONS
       -D device
              Specifies the device name of the control to open

       -c card
              Specifies the card index to open.  Equivalent with -Dhw:x.

       -n index
              Specifies  the  IEC958  control  element  index,  in case you have multiple IEC958 devices and need to
              choose one of them.

       -x     Dumps the status in the form of AESx bytes.

       -i     Reads the command sequences from stdin.  Each line has single command.


COMMANDS
       professional <bool>
              The professional mode (true) or consumer mode (false).


       audio <bool>
              The audio mode (true) or non-audio mode (false).


       rate <int>
              The sample rate in Hz.


       emphasis <int>
              The emphasis: 0 = none, 1 = 50/15us, 2 = CCITT.


       lock <bool>
              Rate lock: locked (true), unlocked (false).  This command is for the professional mode only.


       sbits <int>
              Sample bits:  2 = 20bit, 4 = 24bit, 6 = undefined.  This command is for the professional mode only.


       wordlength <int>
              Wordlength: 0 = No, 2 = 22-18 bit, 4 = 23-19 bit, 5 = 24-20 bit, 6 = 20-16 bit.  This command  is  for
              the professional mode only.


       category <int>
              Category: the value is from 0 to 0x7f.  This command is for the consumer mode only.


       copyright <bool>
              Copyright: copyrighted (true), non-copyrighted (false).  This command is for the consumer mode only.


       original <boo>
              Original flag: original (true), 1st generation (false).  This command is for the consumer mode only.
