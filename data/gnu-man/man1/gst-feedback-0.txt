NAME
       gst-feedback - generate debug info for GStreamer bug reports

SYNOPSIS
       gst-feedback-0.10

DESCRIPTION
       gst-feedback  is a utility that scans the system for various information that is useful to GStreamer develop‐
       ers to help diagnose user problem.

       Depending on the type of bug report, it may be useful to attach the output of gst-feedback when  you  contact
       the developers.

       NOTE:  The  current  version  of  this  script  scans  many  dirs: /usr/lib /usr/local/lib /home /usr/include
       /usr/local/include /home (again) for various GStreamer installations.  Depending on your system you  may  not
       want to do this.  Improvements to the script are welcome.

USAGE
       Generate the feedback information by running gst-feedback:

       gst-feedback

       Possibly redirect output and errors to a file:

       gst-feedback &> myfeedback

WARNING
       The  gst-feedback  dumps  a lot of information about a system, some of which may be considered sensitive.  If
       this is a concern, review the information before posting to a public forum, such as the GStreamer bug  track‐
       ing system.
