NAME
       lispmtopgm - convert a Lisp Machine bitmap file into pgm format

SYNOPSIS
       lispmtopgm [lispmfile]

DESCRIPTION
       Reads a Lisp Machine bitmap as input.  Produces a portable graymap as output.

       This  is  the  file  format written by the tv:write-bit-array-file function on TI Explorer and Symbolics lisp
       machines.

       Multi-plane bitmaps on lisp machines are color; but the lispm image file format does not include a color map,
       so we must treat it as a graymap instead.  This is unfortunate.

SEE ALSO
       pgmtolispm(1), pgm(5)

BUGS
       The  Lispm bitmap file format is a bit quirky;  Usually the image in the file has its width rounded up to the
       next higher multiple of 32, but not always.  If the width is not a multiple of 32,  we  don't  deal  with  it
       properly, but because of the Lispm microcode, such arrays are probably not image data anyway.

       Also,  the  lispm  code  for saving bitmaps has a bug, in that if you are writing a bitmap which is not mod32
       across, the file may be up to 7 bits too short!  They round down instead of up, and we don't handle this  bug
       gracefully.

       No color.
