GIT-CREDENTIAL-STO(1)                                Git Manual                                GIT-CREDENTIAL-STO(1)



NAME
       git-credential-store - Helper to store credentials on disk

SYNOPSIS
       git config credential.helper 'store [options]'


DESCRIPTION
           Note
           Using this helper will store your passwords unencrypted on disk, protected only by filesystem
           permissions. If this is not an acceptable security tradeoff, try git-credential-cache(1), or find a
           helper that integrates with secure storage provided by your operating system.

       This command stores credentials indefinitely on disk for use by future Git programs.

       You probably don’t want to invoke this command directly; it is meant to be used as a credential helper by
       other parts of git. See gitcredentials(7) or EXAMPLES below.

OPTIONS
       --store=<path>
           Use <path> to store credentials. The file will have its filesystem permissions set to prevent other users
           on the system from reading it, but will not be encrypted or otherwise protected. Defaults to
           ~/.git-credentials.

EXAMPLES
       The point of this helper is to reduce the number of times you must type your username or password. For
       example:

           $ git config credential.helper store
           $ git push http://example.com/repo.git
           Username: <type your username>
           Password: <type your password>

           [several days later]
           $ git push http://example.com/repo.git
           [your credentials are used automatically]


STORAGE FORMAT
       The .git-credentials file is stored in plaintext. Each credential is stored on its own line as a URL like:

           https://user:pass@example.com


       When Git needs authentication for a particular URL context, credential-store will consider that context a
       pattern to match against each entry in the credentials file. If the protocol, hostname, and username (if we
       already have one) match, then the password is returned to Git. See the discussion of configuration in
       gitcredentials(7) for more information.
