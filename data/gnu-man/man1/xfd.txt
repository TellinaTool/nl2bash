XFD(1)                                         General Commands Manual                                        XFD(1)



NAME
       xfd - display all the characters in an X font

SYNOPSIS
       xfd [-options ...] -fn fontname

       xfd [-options ...] -fa fontname

DESCRIPTION
       The  xfd  utility creates a window containing the name of the font being displayed, a row of command buttons,
       several lines of text for displaying character metrics, and a grid containing one glyph per cell.  The  char‐
       acters are shown in increasing order from left to right, top to bottom.  The first character displayed at the
       top left will be character number 0 unless the -start option has been supplied in which  case  the  character
       with the number given in the -start option will be used.

       The  characters are displayed in a grid of boxes, each large enough to hold any single character in the font.
       Each character glyph is drawn using the PolyText16 request (used by the Xlib routine  XDrawString16)  or  the
       XftDrawString32  routine, depending on whether the -fn or -fa option was given.  If the -box option is given,
       a rectangle will be drawn around each character, showing where an ImageText16 request (used by the Xlib  rou‐
       tine XDrawImageString16) would cause background color to be displayed.

       The  origin of each glyph is normally set so that the character is drawn in the upper left hand corner of the
       grid cell.  However, if a glyph has a negative left bearing or an unusually large ascent, descent,  or  right
       bearing  (as is the case with cursor font), some character may not appear in their own grid cells.  The -cen‐
       ter option may be used to force all glyphs to be centered in their respective cells.

       All the characters in the font may not fit in the window at once.  To see the next page of glyphs, press  the
       Next button at the top of the window.  To see the previous page, press Prev.  To exit xfd, press Quit.

       Individual  character metrics (index, width, bearings, ascent and descent) can be displayed at the top of the
       window by clicking on the desired character.

       The font name displayed at the top of the window is the full name of the font, as determined by  the  server.
       See  xlsfonts  and  fc-list  for ways to generate lists of fonts, as well as more detailed summaries of their
       metrics and properties.

OPTIONS
       xfd accepts all of the standard toolkit command line options along with the additional options listed below:

       -fn font
               This option specifies the core X server side font to be displayed.  This can also  be  set  with  the
               FontGrid font resource.  A font must be specified.

       -fa font
               This  option  specifies  a  Xft  font  to  be  displayed. This can also be set with the FontGrid face
               resource. A font pattern must be specified.

       -box    This option indicates that a box should be displayed outlining the area that  would  be  filled  with
               background  color by an ImageText request.  This can also be set with the FontGrid boxChars resource.
               The default is False.

       -center This option indicates that each glyph should be centered in its grid.  This can also be set with  the
               FontGrid centerChars resource.  The default is False.

       -start number
               This  option  specifies  the  glyph index of the upper left hand corner of the grid.  This is used to
               view characters at arbitrary locations in the font.  This can also be set with the FontGrid startChar
               resource.  The default is 0.

       -bc color
               This  option  specifies the color to be used if ImageText boxes are drawn.  This can also be set with
               the FontGrid boxColor resource.

       -rows numrows
               This option specifies the number of rows in the grid.  This can also be set with the  FontGrid  cell‐
               Rows resource.

       -columns numcols
               This  option  specifies  the  number  of columns in the grid.  This can also be set with the FontGrid
               cellColumns resource.

WIDGETS
       In order to specify resources, it is useful to know the widgets which compose xfd.  In  the  notation  below,
       indentation  indicates  hierarchical structure.  The widget class name is given first, followed by the widget
       instance name.  The application class name is Xfd.

FONTGRID RESOURCES
       The FontGrid widget is an application-specific widget, and a subclass of the Simple widget in the Athena wid‐
       get  set.  The effects and instance names of this widget's resources are given in the OPTIONS section.  Capi‐
       talize the first letter of the resource instance name to get the corresponding class name.

APPLICATION SPECIFIC RESOURCES
       The instance names of the application specific resources are given below.  Capitalize the first letter of the
       resource  instance  name to get the corresponding class name.  These resources are unlikely to be interesting
       unless you are localizing xfd for a different language.

       selectFormat
               Specifies a printf-style format string used to display information about the selected character.  The
               default  is  "character 0x%02x%02x (%u,%u) (%#o,%#o)".  The arguments that will come after the format
               string are char.byte1, char.byte2, char.byte1, char.byte2,  char.byte1,  char.byte2.   char.byte1  is
               byte 1 of the selected character.  char.byte2 is byte 2 of the selected character.

       metricsFormat
               Specifies  a printf-style format string used to display character metrics.  The default is "width %d;
               left %d, right %d; ascent %d, descent %d (font %d, %d)".  The arguments that will come after the for‐
               mat  string are the character metrics width, lbearing, rbearing, character ascent, character descent,
               font ascent, and font descent.

       rangeFormat
               Specifies a printf-style format string used to display the range of characters currently  being  dis‐
               played.  The default is "range: 0x%02x%02x (%u,%u) thru 0x%02x%02x (%u,%u)".  The arguments that will
               come after the format string are the following fields from the  XFontStruct  that  is  returned  from
               opening   the   font:   min_byte1,   min_char_or_byte2,   min_byte1,   min_char_or_byte2,  max_byte1,
               max_char_or_byte2, max_byte1, max_char_or_byte2.

       startFormat
               Specifies a printf-style format string used to display information about the character at  the  upper
               left  corner of the font grid.  The default is "upper left: 0x%04x (%d,%d)".  The arguments that will
               come after the format string are the new character, the high byte of the new character, and  the  low
               byte of the new character.

       nocharFormat
               Specifies  a  printf-style  format string to display when the selected character does not exist.  The
               default is "no such character 0x%02x%02x (%u,%u) (%#o,%#o)".  The arguments that will come after  the
               format string are the same as for the selectFormat resource.

BUGS
       The program should skip over pages full of non-existent characters.
