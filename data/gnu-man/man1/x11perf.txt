NAME
       x11perf - X11 server performance test program

SYNTAX
       x11perf [ -option ... ]

DESCRIPTION
       The  x11perf  program  runs  one  or  more performance tests and reports how fast an X server can execute the
       tests.

       Many graphics benchmarks assume that the graphics device is used to display the  output  of  a  single  fancy
       graphics  application,  and  that  the  user  gets his work done on some other device, like a terminal.  Such
       benchmarks usually measure drawing speed for lines, polygons, text, etc.

       Since workstations are not used as standalone graphics engines, but as super-terminals, x11perf measures win‐
       dow  management performance as well as traditional graphics performance.  x11perf includes benchmarks for the
       time it takes to create and map windows (as when you start up an application); to map a pre-existing  set  of
       windows onto the screen (as when you deiconify an application or pop up a menu); and to rearrange windows (as
       when you slosh windows to and fro trying to find the one you want).

       x11perf also measures graphics performance for operations not normally used in standalone graphics  displays,
       but  are  nonetheless used frequently by X applications.  Such operations include CopyPlane (used to map bit‐
       maps into pixels), scrolling (used in text windows), and various stipples and tiles (used for CAD  and  color
       half-toning, respectively).

       x11perf  should  be  used  to analyze particular strengths and weaknesses of servers, and is most useful to a
       server writer who wants to analyze and improve a server.  x11perf is meant to comprehensively  exercise  just
       about  every  X11  operation you can perform; it does not purport to be a representative sample of the opera‐
       tions that X11 applications actually use.  While it can be used  as  a  benchmark,  it  was  written  and  is
       intended as a performance testing tool.

       As  such, x11perf DOES NOT whittle down measurements to a single ``HeXStones'' or ``MeXops'' number.  We con‐
       sider such numbers to be uninformative at best and misleading at worst.  Some servers which are very fast for
       certain applications can be very slow for others.  No single number or small set of numbers are sufficient to
       characterize how an X implementation will perform  on  all  applications.   However,  by  knowledge  of  your
       favorite  application,  you  may  be  able to use the numbers x11perf reports to predict its performance on a
       given X implementation.

       That said, you might also want to look at x11perfcomp(1), a program  to  compare  the  outputs  of  different
       x11perf  runs.   You  provide a list of files containing results from x11perf, and it lays them out in a nice
       tabular format.

       For repeatable results, x11perf should be run using a local connection  on  a  freshly-started  server.   The
       default  configuration  runs  each  test  5 times, in order to see if each trial takes approximately the same
       amount of time.  Strange glitches should be examined; if non-repeatable one might chalk them  up  to  daemons
       and  network traffic.  Each trial is run for 5 seconds, in order to reduce random time differences.  The num‐
       ber of objects processed per second is displayed to 3 significant digits, but you'll be lucky  on  most  UNIX
       system  if the numbers are actually consistent to 2 digits.  x11perf moves the cursor out of the test window;
       you should be careful not to bump the mouse and move it back into the window.  (A prize to  people  who  cor‐
       rectly explain why!!).

       Before  running a test, x11perf determines what the round trip time to the server is, and factors this out of
       the final timing reported.  It ensures that the server has actually performed the work requested by  fetching
       a pixel back from the test window, which means that servers talking to graphics accelerators can't claim that
       they are done, while in the meantime the accelerator is painting madly.

       By default x11perf automatically calibrates the number of repetitions of each test, so that each should  take
       approximately  the same length of time to run across servers of widely differing speeds.  However, since each
       test must be run to completion at least once, some slow servers may take a very long  time,  particularly  on
       the window moving and resizing tests, and on the arc drawing tests.

       All  timing reports are for the smallest object involved.  For example, the line tests use a PolyLine request
       to paint several lines at once, but report how many lines per second the server can paint, not how many Poly‐
       Line  requests per second.  Text tests paint a line of characters, but report on the number of characters per
       second.  Some window tests map, unmap, or move a single parent window, but report on how many  children  win‐
       dows per second the server can map, unmap, or move.

       The  current  program is mostly the responsibility of Joel McCormack.  It is based upon the x11perf developed
       by Phil Karlton, Susan Angebranndt, Chris Kent, Mary Walker, and Todd Newman, who wanted  to  assess  perfor‐
       mance  differences  between  various  servers.  Several tests were added  in order to write and tune the PMAX
       (DECStation 3100) servers.  For a general release to the world, x11perf was rewritten to ease making  compar‐
       isons  between  widely  varying  machines,  to cover most important (and unimportant) X functionality, and to
       exercise graphics operations in as many different orientations and alignments as possible.

OPTIONS
       x11perf is solely Xlib based, and accepts the options listed below:

       -display host:dpy
                     Specifies which display to use.

       -sync         Runs the tests in synchronous mode.  Normally only useful for debugging x11perf .

       -pack         Runs rectangle tests so that they pack rectangles right next to each other.  This makes it easy
                     to  debug  server code for stipples and tiles...if the pattern looks ugly, you've got alignment
                     problems.

       -repeat <n>   Repeats each test n times (by default each test is run 5 times).

       -time <s>     Specifies how long in seconds each test should be run (default 5 seconds).

       -all          Runs all tests.  This may take a while.

       -range <test1>[,<test2>]
                     Runs all the tests starting from the specified name test1 until the name test2, including  both
                     the specified tests. The testnames should be one of the options starting from -dot. (eg) -range
                     line100 will perform the tests from the 100 pixel line test, and go  on  till  the  last  test,
                     -range line100,dline10 will do the tests from line100 to dline10.

       -labels       Generates  just  the  descriptive  labels  for  each  test specified.  See x11perfcomp for more
                     details.

       -fg color-or-pixel
                     Specifies the foreground color or pixel value to use.

       -bg color-or-pixel
                     Specifies the background color or pixel value to use.

       -ddbg color-or-pixel
                     Specifies the color or pixel value to use for drawing the odd segments of a  DoubleDashed  line
                     or arc.  This will default to the bg color.

       -rop <rop0 rop1 ...>
                     Use  specified raster ops (default is GXcopy).  This option only affects graphics benchmarks in

       -pm <pm0 pm1 ...>
                     Use specified planemasks (default is ~0).  This option  only  affects  graphics  benchmarks  in
                     which the planemask is actually used.

       -depth <depth>
                     Use a visual with <depth> planes per pixel (default is the default visual).

       -vclass <vclass>
                     Use a visual with of class <vclass>.  <vclass> can be StaticGray, GrayScale, StaticColor, Pseu‐
                     doColor, TrueColor, or DirectColor.  (default is the default visual).

       -reps <n>     Specify the repetition count (Default is number that takes approx. 5 seconds)

       -subs <s0 s1 ...>
