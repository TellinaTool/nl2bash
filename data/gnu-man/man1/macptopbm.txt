NAME
       macptopbm - convert a MacPaint file into a portable bitmap

SYNOPSIS
       macptopbm [-extraskip N] [macpfile]

DESCRIPTION
       Reads a MacPaint file as input.  Produces a portable bitmap as output.

OPTIONS
       -extraskip
              This flag is to get around a problem with some methods of transferring files from the Mac world to the
              Unix world.  Most of these methods leave the Mac files alone, but a few of them add  the  "finderinfo"
              data  onto  the  front  of the Unix file.  This means an extra 128 bytes to skip over when reading the
              file.  The symptom to watch for is that the resulting PBM file looks shifted to one side.  If you  get
              this, try -extraskip 128, and if that still doesn't look right try another value.

       All flags can be abbreviated to their shortest unique prefix.
