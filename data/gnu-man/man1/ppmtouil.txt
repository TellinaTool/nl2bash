ppmtouil(1)                                    General Commands Manual                                   ppmtouil(1)



NAME
       ppmtouil - convert a portable pixmap into a Motif UIL icon file

SYNOPSIS
       ppmtouil [-name uilname] [ppmfile]

DESCRIPTION
       Reads a portable pixmap as input.  Produces a Motif UIL icon file as output.

       If  the program was compiled with an rgb database specified, and a RGB value from the ppm input matches a RGB
       value from the database, then the corresponding color name mnemonic is printed in the UIL's colormap.  If  no
       rgb database was compiled in, or if the RGB values don't match, then the color will be printed with the #RGB,
       #RRGGBB, #RRRGGGBBB, or #RRRRGGGGBBBB hexadecimal format.

OPTIONS
       -name  Allows you to specify the prefix string which is printed in the resulting UIL output.  If  not  speci‐
              fied, will default to the filename (without extension) of the ppmfile argument.  If -name is not spec‐
              ified and no ppmfile is specified (i.e. piped input), the prefix string will  default  to  the  string
              "noname".

       All flags can be abbreviated to their shortest unique prefix.
