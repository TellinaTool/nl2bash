GENBRK(1)                                          ICU 52.1 Manual                                         GENBRK(1)



NAME
       genbrk - Compiles ICU break iteration rules source files into binary data files

SYNOPSIS
       genbrk [ -h, -?, --help ] [ -V, --version ] [ -c, --copyright ] [ -v, --verbose ] [ -d, --destdir destination
       ] [ -i, --icudatadir directory ] -r, --rules rule-file -o, --out output-file

DESCRIPTION
       genbrk reads the break (boundary) rule source code from rule-file and creates a break  iteration  data  file.
       Normally this data file has the .brk extension.

       The details of the rule syntax can be found in ICU's User Guide.

OPTIONS
       -h, -?, --help
              Print help about usage and exit.

       -V, --version
              Print the version of genbrk and exit.

       -c, --copyright
              Embeds the standard ICU copyright into the output-file.

       -v, --verbose
              Display extra informative messages during execution.

       -d, --destdir destination
              Set the destination directory of the output-file to destination.

       -i, --icudatadir directory
              Look  for any necessary ICU data files in directory.  For example, the file pnames.icu must be located
              when ICU's data is not built as a shared library.  The default ICU data directory is specified by  the
              environment variable ICU_DATA.  Most configurations of ICU do not require this argument.

       -r, --rules rule-file
              The source file to read.

       -o, --out output-file
              The output data file to write.

CAVEATS
       When  the rule-file contains a byte order mark (BOM) at the beginning of the file, which is the Unicode char‐
       acter U+FEFF, then the rule-file is interpreted as Unicode. Without the BOM, the file is interpreted  in  the
       current  operating  system default codepage.  In order to eliminate any ambiguity of the encoding for how the
       rule-file was written, it is recommended that you write this file in UTF-8 with the BOM.

ENVIRONMENT
       ICU_DATA  Specifies the directory containing ICU data. Defaults to ${prefix}/share/icu/52.1/.  Some tools  in
                 ICU  depend  on  the  presence  of the trailing slash. It is thus important to make sure that it is
                 present if ICU_DATA is set.
