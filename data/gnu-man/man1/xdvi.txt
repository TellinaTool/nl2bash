DESCRIPTION
       Xdvi  is  a program for previewing dvi files, as produced e.g. by the tex(1) program, under the X window sys‐
       tem.

       Xdvi can show the file shrunken by various integer factors, and it has a  ``magnifying  glass''  for  viewing
       parts of the page enlarged (see the section MAGNIFIER below). This version of xdvi is also referred to as xd‐
       vik since it uses the kpathsea library to locate and generate font files.  In addition to that,  it  supports
       the following features:

         - hyperlinks in DVI files (section HYPERLINKS),

         - direct rendering of PostScript<tm> Type 1 fonts (section TYPE 1 FONTS),

         - source specials in the DVI file (section SOURCE SPECIALS),

         - string search in DVI files (section STRING SEARCH),

         - saving or printing (parts of) the DVI file (sections PRINT DIALOG and SAVE DIALOG).

       Xdvi  can  be compiled with the Motif toolkit or the Xaw (Athena) toolkit (and variants of it), and the Motif
       version has a slightly different GUI; these differences are noted below.

       Before displaying a page of a DVI file, xdvi will check to see if the file has changed since the last time it
       was  displayed.   If this is the case, it will reload the file.  This feature allows you to preview many ver‐
       sions of the same file while running xdvi only once. Since it cannot read partial DVI files,  xdvik  versions
       starting  from 22.74.3 will create a temporary copy of the DVI file being viewed, to ensure that the file can
       be viewed without interruptions. (The -notempfile can be used to turn off this feature).

       Xdvi can show PostScript<tm> specials by any of three methods.  It  will  try  first  to  use  Display  Post‐
       Script<tm>, then NeWS, then it will try to use Ghostscript to render the images.  All of these options depend
       on additional software to work properly; moreover, some of them may not be compiled into this copy of xdvi.

       For performance reasons, xdvi does not render PostScript specials in the magnifying glass.

       If no file name has been specified on the command line, xdvi will try to open the most recently opened  file;
       if  the  file  history  (accessible via the File > Open Recent menu) is empty, or if none of the files in the
       history are valid DVI files, it will pop up a file selector for choosing a file name.  (In previous versions,
       which didn't have a file history, the file selector was always used; you can set the X resource noFileArgUse‐
       History to false to get back the old behaviour.)

OPTIONS
       In addition to specifying the dvi file (with or without the .dvi extension), xdvi supports the following com‐
       mand  line  options.  If the option begins with a `+' instead of a `-', the option is restored to its default
       value.  By default, these options can be set via the resource names given in parentheses in  the  description
       of each option.

       +page  Specifies the first page to show.  If + is given without a number, the last page is assumed; the first
              page is the default.

       -allowshell
              (.allowShell) This option enables the shell escape in PostScript  specials.   (For  security  reasons,
              shell  escapes  are  disabled by default.)  This option should be rarely used; in particular it should
              not be used just to uncompress files: that function is done automatically if the file name ends in .Z,
              .gz, or .bz2.  Shell escapes are always turned off if the -safer option is used.

       -altfont font
              (.altFont) Declares a default font to use when the font in the dvi file cannot be found.  This is use‐
              ful, for example, with PostScript <tm> fonts.

       -background color
              (.background) Determines the color of the background.  Same as -bg.

       -bg color
              (.background) Determines the color of the background.

       -browser browser
              (.wwwBrowser) Defines the web browser used for handling external URLs. The value of this option or re‐
              source  has  the same syntax as the BROWSER environment variable; see the explanation of that variable
              in the section `ENVIRONMENT' below for a detailed description.  If neither the option nor  the  X  re‐
              source  wwwBrowser  is specified, the environment variables BROWSER and WWWBROWSER (in that order) are
              used to determine the browser command. If these are not set either, the  following  default  value  is
              used:   xdg-open  %s:htmlview  %s:firefox  -remote  -remote  "openURL(%s,new-window)":mozilla  -remote
              "openURL(%s,new-window)":netscape -raise -remote "openURL(%s,new-window)":xterm  -e  w3m  %s:xterm  -e
              lynx %s:xterm -e wget %s

       -copy  (.copy) Always use the copy operation when writing characters to the display.  This option may be nec‐
              essary for correct operation on a color display, but overstrike  characters  will  be  incorrect.   If
              greyscale  anti-aliasing  is  in use, the -copy operation will disable the use of colorplanes and make
              overstrikes come out incorrectly.  See also -thorough.

       -cr color
              (.cursorColor) Determines the color of the mouse cursor.  The default is the same  as  the  foreground
              color.

       -debug bitmask|string[,string ...]
              (.debugLevel)  If  nonzero, prints additional information on standard output.  The argument can be ei‐
              ther a bitmask specified as a decimal number, or comma-separated list of strings.
              For the bitmask representation, multiple values can be specified by adding the numbers that  represent
              the  individual  bits;  e.g.  to debug all all file searching and opening commands, use 4032 (= 2048 +
              1024 + 512 + 256 + 128 + 64). Use -1 to turn on debugging of everything (this will produce  huge  out‐
              put).
              For the string representation, use the strings listed in the following table, with a comma to separate
              the  values;  e.g.  to   debug   all   file   searching   and   opening   commands,   use   search,ex‐
              pand,paths,hash,stat,open.   (The  option `kpathsea' is provided as a shorthand for these.)  Note that
              such a list may need to be quoted to prevent the shell from interpreting commas or spaces in the list.
              The individual numbers and strings have the following meanings:

               1       bitmap      Bitmap creation
               2       dvi         DVI translation
               4       pk          PK fonts
               8       batch       Batch mode: Exit after
                                   reading the DVI file
               16      event       Event handling
               32      ps          PostScript interpreter calls
               64      stat        Kpathsea stat(2) calls
               128     hash        Kpathsea hash table lookups
               256     open        Kpathsea file opening
               512     paths       Kpathsea path definitions
               1024    expand      Kpathsea path expansion
               2048    search      Kpathsea searching
               4032    kpathsea    All Kpathsea options
               4096    htex        Hypertex specials
               8192    src         Source specials
               16384   client      Client/server mode (see -unique
                                   and -sourceposition options)
               32768   ft          FreeType library messages (Type 1 fonts)
               65536   ft_verbose  Verbose FreeType library messages (currently unused)
               131072  gui         GUI elements

              Some of the Kpathsea debugging options are actually provided by Kpathsea; see the Debugging section in
              the Kpathsea manual for more information on these.

       -density density
              (.densityPercent)  Determines  the density used when shrinking bitmaps for fonts.  A higher value pro‐
              duces a lighter font.  The default value is 40.  If greyscaling is in use, this argument does not  ap‐
              ply; use -gamma instead.  See also the `S' keystroke.  Same as -S.

       -display host:display
              Specifies  the  host  and  screen to be used for displaying the dvi file.  By default this is obtained
              from the environment variable DISPLAY.

       -dvipspath path
              (.dvipsPath) Use path as the dvips program to use when printing.  The default for this is dvips.   The
              program or script should read the DVI file from standard input, and write the PostScript file to stan‐
              dard output.

       -editor editor
              (.editor) Specifies the editor that will be invoked when the source-special() action is  triggered  to
              start  a reverse search (by default via Ctrl-Mouse 1).  The argument to this option is a format string
              in which occurrences of ``%f'' are replaced by the file name, occurrences of ``%l''  are  replaced  by
              the  line number within the file, and optional occurrences of ``%c'' are replaced by the column number
              within the line.

              If neither the option nor the X resource .editor is specified, the following environment variables are
              checked to determine the editor command: XEDITOR, VISUAL, and EDITOR (in this sequence). If the string
              is found as the value of the VISUAL or EDITOR environment variables, then ``xterm -e ''  is  prepended
              to  the string; if the editor is specified by other means, then it must be in the form of a shell com‐
              mand to pop up an X window with an editor in it. If none of these variables is set, a warning  message
              is displayed and the command ``xterm -e vi +%l %f'' is used.

              If  no  ``%f''  or ``%l'' occurs in the string, the missing format strings are appended automatically.
              (This is for compatibility with other programs when using one of the environment variables).

              A new instance of the editor is started each time this command is used; therefore it is preferable  to
              use  an  editor that can be invoked in `client' mode to load new files into the same instance. Example
              settings are:

              emacsclient --no-wait
                     (older Emacsen)

              gnuclient -q
                     (XEmacs and newer Emacsen)

              gvim --servername xdvi --remote
                     (VIM v6.0+; the `--servername xdvi' option will cause gvim to run a dedicated instance for  the
                     files opened by xdvi.)

              nc     (nedit)

              Note that those strings need to be enclosed into quotes when using them on the command-line to protect
              them from the shell; when using them as argument for the .editor resource in an X  resource  file,  no
              quotes should be used.

              NOTE  ON  SECURITY:  The  argument of this option isn't executed as a shell command, but via exec() to
              prevent evil tricks with the contents of source specials.

       -expert
              This option is only supported for backwards compatibility; it is equivalent to  -expertmode  0,  which
              should be preferred.

       -expertmode flag
              (.expertMode)  With an argument of 0, this option switches off the display of the buttons, scrollbars,
              the toolbar (Motif only), the statusline and the page list. These GUI elements can also  be  (de)acti‐
              vated  separately,  by combining the appropriate values in the flag argument. This acts similar to the
              -debug option: The integer flag is treated as a bitmap where each bit represents one element.  If  the
              bit  has  the value 1, the element is switched on, if it has the value 0, the element is switched off.
              The meaning of the bits is as follows:

               1       statusline
               2       scrollbars
               4       Motif: pagelist, Xaw: buttons and pagelist
               8       toolbar (Motif only)
               16      menubar (Motif only)

              For example, to turn on only the statusline and the scrollbars, use 3 (= 1 + 2).   See  also  the  `x'
              keystroke,  where  the  bits are addressed by their positions, from 1 to 3 (Xaw) or 5 (Motif), respec‐
              tively.

       If the statusline is not active, all messages that would normally be printed to the statusline will be print‐
       ed to stdout, unless the -hushstdout option is used.

       -fg color
              (.foreground) Determines the color of the text (foreground).

       -text-encoding encoding
              (.textEncoding)  Use  encoding  as  text  encoding  of  the string in the "Find" window. Usually, this
              shouldn't be needed since the encoding is determined from the locale settings.

       -findstring string
              This option triggers a search for string in the DVI file mentioned on  the  command-line,  similar  to
              forward  search  (see  the  description of the sourceposition option): If there is already another in‐
              stance of xdvi running on the displaying that DVI file, it will cause that  instance  to  perform  the
              search instead. The search starts at the top of the current page of the DVI file.

       -font font
              (*font)  Sets  the  font used in menus, buttons etc., as described in the X(7x) man page. The font for
              child windows can be set separately, e.g.:

              xdvi*statusline*font: \
                 -*-helvetica-medium-r-*-*-12-*-*-*-*-*-*-*


       -foreground color
              Same as -fg.

       -fullscreen
              When this option is used, xdvi will (try to) run in fullscreen mode, with no window decorations.  This
              option  is  not  guaranteed  to work with all windowmanagers/desktops; if you're experiencing problems
              with it, please use the -geometry option instead, and a suitable window manager setting to remove  the
              window  decorations.   When  using this option for presentations, you might want to get rid of all the
              control widgets as well, using the -expertmode option. This option can also be toggled at runtime  us‐
              ing the fullscreen action (by default bound to Ctrl-l).

       -gamma gamma
              (.gamma)  Controls  the interpolation of colors in the greyscale anti-aliasing color palette.  Default
              value is 1.0.  For 0 < gamma < 1, the fonts will be lighter (more like the background), and for  gamma
              >  1,  the  fonts will be darker (more like the foreground).  Negative values behave the same way, but
              use a slightly different algorithm.  For color and grayscale displays; for monochrome,  see  -density.
              See also the `S' keystroke.

       -geometry geometry
              (.geometry) Specifies the initial geometry of the main window, as described in the X(7x) man page. The
              geometry of child windows can be set separately, e.g.:
              xdvi*helpwindow.geometry: 600x800

       -gsalpha
              (.gsAlpha) Causes Ghostscript to be called with the x11alpha driver instead of the  x11  driver.   The
              x11alpha driver enables anti-aliasing in PostScript specials, for a nicer appearance.  It is available
              on newer versions of Ghostscript.  This option can also be toggled with the `V' keystroke.

       -gspalette palette
              (.palette) Specifies the palette to be used when using Ghostscript for rendering PostScript  specials.
              Possible values are Color, Greyscale, and Monochrome.  The default is Color.

       -h, -help, --help
              Prints a short help text with an overview of the command-line options to standard output.

       -hl color
              (.highlight)  Determines  the color of the page border, of the ruler in `ruler mode', and of the high‐
              lighting markers in forward search and string search.  The default is the foreground color.

       -anchorposition anchor
              Jump to anchor after opening the DVI file. This is only useful when invoking xdvi from other  applica‐
              tions.

       -hush  (.Hush) Causes xdvi to suppress all suppressible warnings.

       -hushchars
              (.hushLostChars) Causes xdvi to suppress warnings about references to characters which are not defined
              in the font.

       -hushchecksums
              (.hushChecksums) Causes xdvi to suppress warnings about checksum mismatches between the dvi  file  and
              the font file.

       -hushstdout
              (.hushStdout)  Suppresses  printing  of  status messages to stdout.  Note that errors or warnings will
              still be printed to stderr even if this option is used.

       -hushbell
              (.hushBell) Don't sound the X bell when an error occurs.

       -icongeometry geometry
              (.iconGeometry) Specifies the initial position for the icon.

       -iconic
              (.iconic) Causes the xdvi window to start in the iconic state.  The default is to start with the  win‐
              dow open.

       -install
              (.install) If xdvi is running under a PseudoColor visual, then (by default) it will check for TrueCol‐
              or visuals with more bits per pixel, and switch to such a visual if one exists.  If no such visual ex‐
              ists,  it  will  use the current visual and colormap.  If -install is selected, however, it will still
              use a TrueColor visual with a greater depth, if one is available; otherwise, it will install  its  own
              colormap  on  the current visual.  If the current visual is not PseudoColor, then xdvi will not switch
              the visual or colormap, regardless of its options.  The default value of the install resource  is  the
              special value, maybe.  There is no +install option.  See also -noinstall, and the GREYSCALING AND COL‐
              ORMAPS section.

       -interpreter filename
              (.interpreter) Use filename as the Ghostscript interpreter.  By default it uses gs.

       -keep  (.keepPosition) Sets a flag to indicate that xdvi should not move to the home position when moving  to
              a new page.  See also the `k' keystroke. This flag is honored by all page switching actions and by up-
              or-previous() / down-or-next(), although the latter only honor the horizontal postion, not the  verti‐
              cal  one.   This  allows  for a "continuous" scrolling back an forth through a document with a display
              window narrower than a page width.

       -l     (.listFonts) List the names of all fonts used.

       -license
              Prints licensing information.

       -linkcolor
              (.linkColor) Color used for unvisited hyperlinks (`Blue2' by default). Hyperlinks are unvisited before
              you click on them, or after the DVI file has been reloaded.  The value should be either a valid X col‐
              or name (such as DarkGoldenrod4) or a hexadecimal color string (such as #8b6508).   See  also  -visit‐
              edlinkcolor and -linkstyle.

       -linkstyle
              (.LinkStyle)  Determines  the style in which hyperlinks are displayed. Possible values and their mean‐
              ings are:

               0       No highlighting of links
               1       Underline links with link color
               2       No underlining, color text with link color
               3       Underline and display text colored with
                       link color

              The values for link color are specified by  the  options/resources  -linkcolor  and  -visitedlinkcolor
              (which see).

       -margins dimen
              (.Margin) Specifies the size of both the top margin and side margin.  This determines the ``home'' po‐
              sition of the page within the window as follows.  If the entire page fits in the window, then the mar‐
              gin  settings are ignored.  If, even after removing the margins from the left, right, top, and bottom,
              the page still cannot fit in the window, then the page is put in the window such that the top and left
              margins  are  hidden, and presumably the upper left-hand corner of the text on the page will be in the
              upper left-hand corner of the window.  Otherwise, the text is centered in the window.   The  dimension
              should  be  a  decimal number optionally followed by any of the two-letter abbreviations for units ac‐
              cepted by TeX (pt, pc, in, bp, cm, mm, dd, cc, or sp).  By default, the unit will be cm (centimeters).
              See also -sidemargin, -topmargin, and the keystroke `M.'

       -mfmode mode-def
              (.mfMode)  Specifies a mode-def string, which can be used in searching for fonts (see ENVIRONMENT, be‐
              low).  Generally, when changing the mode-def, it is also necessary to change the font size to the  ap‐
              propriate value for that mode.  This is done by adding a colon and the value in dots per inch; for ex‐
              ample, -mfmode ljfour:600.  This method overrides any value given by the pixelsPerInch resource or the
              -p  command-line  argument.  The metafont mode is also passed to metafont during automatic creation of
              fonts.  By default, it is unspecified.

       -mgs size
              Same as -mgs1.

       -mgs[n] size
              (.magnifierSize[n]) Specifies the size of the window to be used for the ``magnifying glass'' for  But‐
              ton n.  The size may be given as an integer (indicating that the magnifying glass is to be square), or
              it may be given in the form widthxheight.  See the  MOUSE  ACTIONS  section.   Defaults  are  200x150,
              400x250, 700x500, 1000x800, and 1200x1200.

       -mousemode [0|1|2]
              (.mouseMode)  Specifies the default mode of xdvi at startup: Magnifier (0), Text Selection Mode (1) or
              Ruler Mode (2). See the section MODES, below, for more information.

       -nocolor
              (.color) Turns off the use of color specials.  This option can be  toggled  with  the  `C'  keystroke.
              (Note: -nocolor corresponds to color:off; +nocolor to color:on.)

       -nofork
              (.fork)  With  the -sourceposition and -unique options, the default behavior is for xdvi to put itself
              into the background (like a daemon) if there is no appropriate instance of xdvi already running.  This
              argument  makes it run in the foreground instead.  This is useful for debugging, or if your client ap‐
              plication cannot deal well with a program self-backgrounding itself in this way -- e.g., the IPC func‐
              tions  in  emacs  are  known to have problems with this.  If no -sourceposition or -unique argument is
              given, then this option has no effect.  (Note: -nofork corresponds to fork:off; +nofork to fork:on.)

       -noghostscript
              (.ghostscript) Inhibits the  use  of  Ghostscript  for  displaying  PostScript<tm>  specials.   (Note:
              -noghostscript corresponds to ghostscript:off; +noghostscript to ghostscript:on.)

       -nogrey
              (.grey)  Turns  off the use of greyscale anti-aliasing when printing shrunken bitmaps.  (Note: -nogrey
              corresponds to grey:off; +nogrey to grey:on.)  See also the `G' keystroke.

       -nogssafer
              (.gsSafer) Normally, if Ghostscript is used to render PostScript specials, the Ghostscript interpreter
              is  run with the option -dSAFER.  The -nogssafer option runs Ghostscript without -dSAFER.  The -dSAFER
              option in Ghostscript disables PostScript operators such as deletefile, to prevent possibly  malicious
              PostScript  programs  from having any effect.  If the -safer option is specified, then this option has
              no effect; in that case Ghostscript is always run with  -dSAFER.   (Note:  -nogssafer  corresponds  to
              gsSafer:off; +nogssafer to gsSafer:on.)

       -noinstall
              (.install)  Inhibit  the  default behavior of switching to a TrueColor visual if one is available with
              more bits per pixel than the current visual.  (Note: -noinstall corresponds install:off; there  is  no
              +noinstall option.)  See also -install, and the GREYSCALING AND COLORMAPS section.

       -nomakepk
              (.makePk)  Turns  off  automatic generation of font files that cannot be found by other means.  (Note:
              -nomakepk corresponds to makePk:off; +nomakepk to makePK:on.)

       -nomatchinverted
              (.matchInverted) Don't highlight string search matches in inverted color; instead, draw a rectangle in
              highlight  color  (see the -hl option) around the match. This option is activated automatically if the
              display isn't running in TrueColor.  (Note: -nomatchinverted corresponds  to  matchInverted:off;  +no‐
              matchinverted to matchInverted:on.)

       -noomega
              (.omega)  This  will disable the use of Omega extensions when interpreting DVI files.  By default, the
              additional opcodes 129 and 134 are recognized by xdvi as Omega extensions and interpreted as  requests
              to  set  2-byte  characters. The only drawback is that the virtual font array will require 65536 posi‐
              tions instead of the default 256 positions, i.e. the memory requirements  of  xdvi  will  be  slightly
              larger.  If you find this unacceptable or encounter another problem with the Omega extensions, you can
              switch this extension off by using -noomega (but please do send a bug report if you find such problems
              - see the bug address in the AUTHORS section below).
              (Note: -noomega corresponds to omega: off; +noomega to omega: on.)

       -noscan
              (.prescan) By default, xdvi does a preliminary scan of the dvi file to process any papersize specials;
              this is especially important at startup since the paper size may be needed  to  determine  the  window
              size.   If  PostScript<tm>  is in use, then prescanning is also necessary in order to properly process
              header files.  In addition, prescanning is needed to correctly determine the  background  color  of  a
              page.   This  option turns off such prescanning.  (Prescanning will be automatically be turned back on
              if xdvi detects any of the specials mentioned above.)   (Note:  -noscan  corresponds  to  prescan:off;
              +noscan to prescan:on.)

       -notype1fonts
              (.type1)  This  will  disable  the use of the FreeType library to display PostScript<tm> Type 1 fonts.
              Use this option as a workaround when you encounter problems with the display  of  Type  1  fonts  (but
              please don't forget to send a bug report in this case, to the URL mentioned in the section AUTHORS be‐
              low).
              (Note: -notype1fonts corresponds to type1:off; +notype1fonts to type1:on.)

       -notempfile
              (.tempFile) As mentioned in the section DESCRIPTION above, xdvi will create a temporary  copy  of  the
              DVI  file  so  that it can be accessed without interruptions even while the file is being rewritten by
              TeX.  Since this introduces the overhead of copying the file every time it has changed,  the  -notemp‐
              file  allows  you to turn off this behaviour. In this case, exposing parts of the window while the DVI
              file is being written by TeX will erase the current window contents until the DVI  file  can  be  com‐
              pletely reread.
              (Note: -notempfile corresponds to tempFile:off; +notempfile to tempFile:on.)

       -offsets dimen
              (.Offset)  Specifies  the  size of both the horizontal and vertical offsets of the output on the page.
              By decree of the Stanford TeX Project, the default TeX page origin is always 1 inch over and down from
              the top-left page corner, even when non-American paper sizes are used.  Therefore, the default offsets
              are 1.0 inch.  The argument dimen should be a decimal number optionally followed by any  of  the  two-
              letter  abbreviations  for units accepted by TeX (pt, pc, in, bp, cm, mm, dd, cc, or sp).  By default,
              the unit will be cm (centimeters).  See also -xoffset and -yoffset.

       -p pixels
              (.pixelsPerInch) Defines the size of the fonts to use, in pixels per inch.  The default value is  600.
              This option is provided only for backwards compatibility; the preferred way is to set both the resolu‐
              tion and the Metafont mode via the -mfmode option (which see).

       -paper papertype
              (.paper) Specifies the size of the printed page. Note that in most cases it's best to specify the  pa‐
              per size in the TeX input file via the line

              \usepackage[dvips]{geometry}

              which  will  be recognized by both dvips and xdvi; in that case the use of a `-paper' option should be
              unnecessary.
              The paper size may be specified in the form widthxheight optionally followed by a  unit,  where  width
              and height are decimal numbers giving the width and height of the paper, respectively, and the unit is
              any of the two-letter abbreviations for units accepted by TeX (pt, pc, in, bp, cm, mm, dd, cc, or sp).
              By default, the unit is cm (centimeters).
              There  are  also synonyms which may be used: us (8.5x11in), legal (8.5x14in), foolscap (13.5x17in), as
              well as the ISO sizes a1-a7, b1-b7, c1-c7.  Each of these also has a landscape or  `rotated'  variant:
              usr  (11x8.5in),  a1r-a7r,  etc.  For  compatibility with dvips, the formats letter (8.5x11in), ledger
              (17x11in) and tabloid (11x17in) are also supported (these don't have rotated variants).
              Any of the above sizes may be preceded by a plus sign (`+'); this causes the paper size given here  to
              override any paper size given in the dvi file.  The default paper size is 21 x 29.7 cm (A4 size).

       -pause (.pause)  This option provides a simple implementation of incremental (stepwise) display, which can be
              used for presentations.  When this option is used, xdvi will pause the display  of  the  current  page
              whenever  it  encounters a special special-string (xdvi:pause by default; the string can be customized
              via -pausespecial, see below), and the cursor will change its shape.  The action unpause-or-next() (by
              default bound to the Space key) will display the next portion of the page up to the following special-
              string, or until the end of the page is reached.  When the option is  not  used,  specials  containing
              special-string will be ignored.

       -pausespecial special-string
              (.pauseSpecial)  Sets  the  special string that causes xdvi to pause when the -pause option is active.
              The default value of special-string is xdvi:pause.

       -postscript flag
              (.postscript) If flag = 0, rendering of PostScript<tm> specials is disabled; instead,  bounding  boxes
              will be displayed (if available). A value of 1 (the default) switches PostScript<tm> specials on. With
              a value of 2, the PostScript<tm> specials are displayed along with their bounding boxes;  this  allows
              you to visually check the correctness of the bounding boxes. The values can also be toggled at runtime
              with the `v' keystroke and the corresponding numerical prefix arguments 0, 1 and 2.

       -ps2pdfpath path
              (.ps2pdfPath) Use path as a conversion program from PostScript to PDF. The program  or  script  should
              accept  two  command-line arguments: The PostScript file as first argument, and the PDF output file as
              second argument.

       -rulecolor color
              (.ruleColor) Determines the color of the rules used for the the magnifier (default: foreground color).

       -q     (.noInitFile) Ignore the $HOME/.xdvirc startup file (i.e. don't read it at startup, and don't write it
              at exit). This forces the defaults defined in $HOME/.Xdefaults to be used. See FILES for more informa‐
              tion on $HOME/.xdvirc.

       -rv    (.reverseVideo) Causes the page to be displayed with white characters on a black  background,  instead
              of vice versa.

       -S density
              (.densityPercent) Same as -density (which see).

       -s shrink
              (.shrinkFactor)  Defines the initial shrink factor.  The default value is 8.  If shrink is given as 0,
              then the initial shrink factor is computed so that the page fits within the window (as if the `s' key‐
              stroke were given without a number).

       -safer (.safer)  This  option  turns  on  all available security options; it is designed for use when xdvi is
              called by a browser that obtains a dvi or TeX file from another site.  This option selects  +nogssafer
              and +allowshell.

       -sidemargin dimen
              (.sideMargin) Specifies the side margin (see -margins).

       -sourceposition line[:col][ ]filename
              This  option makes xdvi search in the dvi file for the place corresponding to the indicated line (and,
              optionally, column) in the .tex source file, and highlight the place found by drawing a  rectangle  in
              the  highlight  color  (see the -hl option) around the corresponding text.  In addition, when run with
              this argument (and the -nofork option is not given, which see), xdvi will always  return  immediately:
              if  it  finds  another  instance of xdvi already showing dvi_file, then it will cause that instance to
              raise its window and move to the given place in the dvi file; otherwise it will start up its  own  in‐
              stance  in  the  background.  If several instances of xdvi are displaying the respective dvi file, the
              instance which was last raised to the foreground will be used.

              The space before filename is only needed if the filename starts with a digit.  When the space is used,
              the argument needs to be enclosed in quotes to prevent the shell from misinterpreting the space as ar‐
              gument separator.

              This option requires that dvi_file be prepared with source special information.  See  the  section  on
              SOURCE SPECIALS for details on how to do this.

              Here  is  a  more  detailed description of how the filename in the -sourceposition argument is matched
              with the filename in the source specials:

              1. If neither of the filenames contains a path name component, the filenames are compared ignoring the
                 `.tex' extensions in both filenames.

              2. Otherwise,  if  one  of the filenames does contain a path component (e.g.: ./test.tex, ../test.tex,
                 /my/homedir/tex/test.tex or any combination of these), both filenames are expanded to a full  path,
                 with any occurrences of ../ and ./ expanded, and multiple slashes removed.
                 The  pathname  in  the -sourceposition is expanded relative to the current working directory of the
                 xdvi -sourceposition invocation, and the pathnames in the source specials are expanded relative  to
                 the path of the current DVI file being viewed.
                 The path names are then compared ignoring the `.tex' extensions in both path names.

       -statusline
              (.statusline) This option is obsolete; use -expertmode  flag instead (which see).

       -thorough
              (.thorough) Xdvi will usually try to ensure that overstrike characters (e.g., \notin) are printed cor‐
              rectly.  On monochrome displays, this is always possible with one logical operation, either and or or.
              On  color  displays, however, this may take two operations, one to set the appropriate bits and one to
              clear other bits.  If this is the case, then by default xdvi will  instead  use  the  copy  operation,
              which  does  not handle overstriking correctly.  The -thorough option chooses the slower but more cor‐
              rect choice.  See also -copy.

       -topmargin dimen
              (.topMargin) Specifies the top and bottom margins (see -margins).

       -unique
              (.unique) This option will make another instance of xdvi running on the same display act as  a  `serv‐
              er'.  For example, the invocation

              xdvi -unique +5 file.dvi

              will  cause  this  other instance to load file.dvi on page 5 in place of the file that it is currently
              displaying. If there is already another instance of xdvi already displaying the file file.dvi, then it
              will  just jump to page 5.  If the other instance of xdvi is displaying a different file, it will load
              file.dvi instead. Otherwise, if no other instance of xdvi is currently running on  the  display,  this
              option  instead  starts  a new instance of xdvi in the background (unless the -nofork option is speci‐
              fied, which see) displaying page 5 of file.dvi.
              The filename and the +n option for the page number are the only options available  for  controlling  a
              remote instance of xdvi like this; all other options are currently ignored.

       -useTeXpages
              Use  logical TeX pages (the values of the \count0 register) instead of physical pages for the pagelist
              labels and when jumping to a page in a document with the `g' keystroke (or  the  goto-page()  action).
              This option can be toggled via the `T' keystroke.

       -version
              Print information on the version of xdvi.

       -visitedlinkcolor
              (.visitedLinkColor) Color used for visited hyperlinks (`Purple4' by default). Hyperlinks become visit‐
              ed once you click on them. As for linkColor, the value should be either a valid  X  color  name  or  a
              hexadecimal color string.

       -warnspecials
              (.warnSpecials) Causes xdvi to print warnings about \special strings that it cannot process to stderr.
              These warnings are suppressed by default.

       -watchfile n
              (.watchFile) If this option is set to a value larger than 0, xdvi will check the DVI file for  changes
              every  n seconds. If the DVI file has been completely written by TeX, it will be reloaded automatical‐
              ly.  Fractional values (e.g. `2.5') are possible. The default for this option is 0, i.e. no watching.
              Since xdvi cannot handle partial DVI files, it tries not to reload the file while it is being  rewrit‐
              ten.   However,  use of the magnifier or switching of pages requires reading (a part of) the DVI file,
              and if the tempfile option is switched off, this will erase the current contents of the  window  until
              the DVI file can be read entirely.

       -wheelunit pixels
              (.wheelUnit)  Sets  the  number of pixels that a motion of a wheel mouse will move the image up, down,
              left, or right. (See the wheel and hwheel actions, below, for more information on this.)   If  set  to
              zero, the wheel mouse functionality is (essentially) disabled.  The default value is 80.

       -xoffset dimen
              (.xOffset) Specifies the size of the horizontal offset of the output on the page.  See -offsets.

       -yoffset dimen
              (.yOffset) Specifies the size of the vertical offset of the output on the page.  See -offsets.

KEYSTROKES
       Xdvi  recognizes  the  following  keystrokes  when typed in its window.  Each may optionally be preceded by a
       (positive or negative) number, a `prefix argument', whose interpretation will depend on the  particular  key‐
       stroke.   This  prefix  argument  can be discarded by pressing the ``Escape'' key.  If present, the ``Help'',
       ``Prior'' and ``Next'' keys are synonyms for `?', `b', and `f' keys, respectively.

       The key bindings listed here are those that xdvi assigns by default.  The names appearing in brackets at  the
       beginning  of  the  descriptions  are the names of the actions associated with the keys; these can be used to
       customize the key bindings, as explained in more detail in the section CUSTOMIZATION below. If only a  lower‐
       case binding is listed, both upper- and lowercase keys will work for that binding.

       ESC key
              [discard-number()]  The  escape  key  discards  the  numerical prefix for all actions (useful when you
              mistyped a number).

       Return key
              [forward-page()] Moves to the next page (or to the nth next page if a number is given).  Synonyms  are
              `n', `f' and Line Feed.

       Backspace key
              [back-pagee()] Moves to the previous page (or back n pages).  Synonyms are `p', `b' and Ctrl-h.

       Delete key
              [up-or-previous()] Moves up two-thirds of a window-full, or to the top of the previous page if already
              at the top of the page. With a float argument, moves up the corresponding fraction of a window-full.

       Space key
              [unpause-or-next()] Moves down two-thirds of a window-full, or to the next page if already at the bot‐
              tom of the page.
              When  the  option -pause special-string is used and the display is currently paused, this key will in‐
              stead display the next portion of the page until the next special-string or the end of the page is en‐
              countered.   See  the description of the -pause option for details. The action [down-or-next()] does a
              similar thing, but without pausing; it is not bound to a key by default.

       Ctrl-Home (Xaw), Ctrl-osfBeginLine (Motif)
              [goto-page(1)] Moves to the first page of the document.

       Ctrl-End (Xaw), Ctrl-osfEndLine (Motif)
              [goto-page()] Moves to the last page of the document.

       Home (Xaw), osfBeginLine (Motif)
              [home-or-top()] Move to the ``home'' position of the page, or to the top of the page if the keep  flag
              is set (in this case, the page doesn't scroll horizontally).

       End (Xaw), osfEndLine (Motif)
              [end-or-bottom()]  Move  to  the ``end'' position of the page (the lower right-hand corner), or to the
              bottom of the page if the keep flag is set (in this case, the page doesn't scroll horizontally).

       Down arrow
              [down(0.015)] Scrolls page down.

       Up arrow
              [up(0.015)] Scrolls page up.

       Right arrow
              [right(0.015)] Scrolls page right.

       Left arrow
              [left(0.015)] Scrolls page left.

       Alt-Ctrl-+
              [change-density(25)] Increase the darkness of the fonts in the DVI window by adding to the gamma value
              (see also the `S' keystroke).

       Alt-Ctrl--
              [change-density(-25)]  Decrease  the  darkness  of the fonts in the DVI window by subtracting from the
              gamma value (see also the `S' keystroke).

       Ctrl-+ [set-shrink-factor(+)] Increase the shrink factor (see also the `s' keystroke).

       Ctrl-- [set-shrink-factor(-)] Decrease the shrink factor (see also the `s' keystroke).

       Ctr-[  [pagehistory-delete-backward()] Delete the current item in the page history and move  to  the  history
              item  before the deleted one. With a prefix argument n, delete n previous history items. See PAGE HIS‐
              TORY for details.

       [      [pagehistory-back()] Move back in the page history (see PAGE HISTORY for details). With a prefix argu‐
              ment n, move back n history items.

       Ctr-]  [pagehistory-delete-forward()]  Delete  the  current  item in the page history and move to the history
              item after the deleted one. With a prefix argument n, delete n next history items.  See  PAGE  HISTORY
              for details.

       ]      [pagehistory-forward()] Move forward in the page history (see PAGE HISTORY for details). With a prefix
              argument n, move forward n history items.

       ^      [home()] Move to the ``home'' position of the page.  This is normally the upper  left-hand  corner  of
              the page, depending on the margins as described in the -margins option, above.

       ?      [help()] Same as the h key (which see).

       B      [htex-back()]  This  key  jumps  back to the previous hyperlink anchor. See the section HYPERLINKS for
              more information on navigating the links.

       b      [back-page()] Moves to the previous page (or back n pages).  Synonyms are `p', Ctrl-h and Backspace.

       C      [set-color()] This key toggles the use of color specials.  The key sequences `0C' and `1C' turn inter‐
              pretation of color specials off and on, respectively.  See also the -nocolor option.

       c      [center()]  Moves the page so that the point currently beneath the mouse cursor is moved to the middle
              of the window, and warps the mouse cursor to the same place.

       D      [toggle-grid-mode()] This key toggles the use of a grid on the displayed page.  If no number is given,
              the  grid mode is switched on or off.  By prepending a number from 1 to 3, 3 different grid levels can
              be set.  The units of the grid are inches or centimeters, depending on whether  the  paper  format  is
              letter (in) or a4 (cm).

       d      [down()]  Moves  page  down two thirds of a window-full. With a float argument to ``down'', moves down
              the corresponding fraction of a window-full.

       Ctrl-f [find()] Pop up a window to search for a string in the DVI file. See the section STRING SEARCH, below,
              for more details.

       f      [forward-page()]  Moves to the next page (or to the nth next page if a number is given).  Synonyms are
              `n', Return, and Line Feed.

       G      [set-greyscaling()] This key toggles the use of greyscale anti-aliasing for displaying  shrunken  bit‐
              maps.   In  addition, the key sequences `0G' and `1G' clear and set this flag, respectively.  See also
              the -nogrey option.

              If given a numeric argument that is not 0 or 1, greyscale anti-aliasing is turned on,  and  the  gamma
              resource is set to the value divided by 100. E.g., `150G' turns on greyscale and sets gamma to 1.5.

       Ctrl-g [find-next()]  Find  the  next  match string in the DVI file; this can be used instead of pressing the
              `Find' button in the search window.

       g      [goto-page()] Moves to the page with the given number. If no page number is given, xdvi jumps  to  the
              last page.
              If the option/resource useTeXpages is active, the numbers correspond to the actual page numbers in the
              TeX file; otherwise, absolute page numbers (starting from 1) are used. In the latter  case,  the  page
              numbers  can  be  changed  with the `P' keystroke, below.  Note that with the useTeXpages option it is
              possible that the same page number occurs multiple times; in such a case, xdvi will use the first page
              number that matches.

       h      Pops up a help window with a short explanation of the most important key bindings and concepts.

       k      [set-keep-flag()]  Normally  when xdvi switches pages, it moves to the home position as well.  The `k'
              keystroke toggles a `keep-position' flag which, when set, will keep the same position when moving  be‐
              tween pages.  Also `0k' and `1k' clear and set this flag, respectively.  See also the -keep option.

       Ctrl-l [fullscreen(toggle)]  Toggles  fullscreen mode (see the description of the -fullscreen option for more
              information on this). This is even more flaky than using the command-line option: There is no  univer‐
              sal  standard  how  a  window could change its own geometry or window decorations at run-time, so this
              will not work with most window managers or desktops. Generally, it's better to use the window  manager
              controls to change the size or decorations of the xdvi window.

       l      [left()] Moves page left two thirds of a window-full.

       M      [set-margins()]  Sets the margins so that the point currently under the mouse cursor defines the upper
              left-hand corner of the text in the page.  Note that the command does not move the image, but only de‐
              termines the margins for the page switching commands. For details on how the margins are used, see the
              -margins option.

       m      [toggle-mark()] Toggles the mark for the current page in the page list. When a page is marked,  it  is
              displayed  with  a  small  star  `*' next to the page number.  The marked pages can then be printed or
              saved to a file.  A page or several pages can also be marked by clicking or dragging  Mouse-2  in  the
              page list.

       Ctrl-n [toggle-mark()forward-page()] Toggles the mark for the current page in the page list, and moves to the
              next page. This lets you quickly mark a series of subsequent pages.

       n      [forward-page()] Moves to the next page (or to the nth next page if a number is given).  Synonyms  are
              `f', Return, and Line Feed.

       Ctrl-o [select-dvi-file()]  Read  a  new dvi file. A file-selection widget is popped up for you to choose the
              DVI file from. If a prefix argument n is given, the n th file from the file history is opened instead.

       P      [declare-page-number()] ``This is page number n.''  This can be used to make the `g'  keystroke  refer
              to  a different page number than the physical page.  (If you want to use `logical' or TeX page numbers
              instead of physical pages, consider using the option -useTeXpages instead.)  The argument n should  be
              given as prefix to this key.

       Ctrl-p [print()]  Opens a popup window for printing the DVI file, or parts of it.  See the section PRINT DIA‐
              LOG for an explanation of the options available, and the resources to customize the default behaviour.

       p      [back-page()] Moves to the previous page (or back n pages).  Synonyms are `b', Ctrl-h and Backspace.

       q      [quit()] Quits the program.

       Ctrl-r [forward-page(0)] Redisplays the current page.

       R      [reread-dvi-file()] Forces the dvi file to be reread.  This allows you to preview many versions of the
              same file while running xdvi only once.

       r      [right()] Moves page right two thirds of a window-full.

       Ctrl-s [save()] Opens a popup window for saving the DVI file, or parts of it. See the section SAVE DIALOG be‐
              low for more information on this.

       S      [set-density()] Sets the density factor to be used when shrinking bitmaps.  This should  be  a  number
              between  0 and 100; higher numbers produce lighter characters.  If greyscaling mode is in effect, this
              changes the value of gamma instead.  The new value of gamma is the given number divided by 100;  nega‐
              tive values are allowed.

       s      [set-shrink-factor()]  Changes  the  shrink  factor  to  the given number.  If no number is given, the
              smallest factor that makes the entire page fit in the window will be used.  (Margins  are  ignored  in
              this computation.)

       T      [use-tex-pages()] Use logical TeX pages (the values of the \count0 register) instead of physical pages
              for the pagelist labels and when jumping to a page in a document via goto-page().  See also the -useT‐
              eXpages option.

       t      [switch-magnifier-units()] Switches the units used for the magnifier tick marks, and for reporting the
              distance between the mouse pointer and the ruler centre in ruler mode (see the  section  MODES).   The
              default value is specified by the X resource tickUnits (`mm' by default). The units toggle through the
              following values; except for `px', they all correspond  to  TeX's  units:  mm  (millimeters)  pt  (TeX
              points),  in  (inches),  sp  (scaled points, the unit used internally by TeX) bp (big points or `Post‐
              Script points'), cc (cicero points), dd (didot points), pc (pica), and px (screen pixels).

       Ctrl-u [back-page()toggle-mark()] Moves to the previous page, and toggles the mark for that page. This is the
              dual action to Ctrl-n.

       u      [up()] Moves page up two thirds of a window-full. With a float argument to ``up'', moves up the corre‐
              sponding fraction of a window-full.

       Ctrl-v [show-source-specials()] Show bounding boxes for every source special on the current page,  and  print
              the strings contained in these specials to stderr. With prefix 1, show every bounding box on the page.
              This is for debugging purposes mainly.

       V      [set-gs-alpha()] This key toggles the anti-aliasing of PostScript<tm>  specials  when  Ghostscript  is
              used  as renderer.  In addition the key sequences `0V' and `1V' clear and set this flag, respectively.
              See also the -gsalpha option.

       v      [set-ps()] This key toggles the rendering of PostScript<tm> specials between 3 states:

              - specials (like EPS graphics) are displayed;

              - specials are displayed along with their bounding box (if available);

              - only the bounding box is displayed.

              The states can also be selected directly by using `1v', `2v' and  `0v'  respectively.   See  also  the
              -postscript option.

       Ctrl-x [source-what-special()]  Display  information about the source special next to the mouse cursor in the
              statusline. This is the same special that would be found by source-special(), but without invoking the
              editor. For debugging purposes.

       x      [set-expert-mode()]  Toggles  expert  mode, in which the statusline, the scrollbars, the menu buttons,
              the toolbar (Motif only) and the page list are not shown.  Typing `1x' toggles the display of the sta‐
              tusline  at the bottom of the window. Typing `2x' toggles the scrollbars (if available). For Xaw, `3x'
              toggles the menu buttons and the page list, for Motif, it toggles the page list. In Motif,  the  addi‐
              tional bindings `4x' toggle the toolbar, and `5x' the menu bar.
              Without  a prefix argument, all of the mentioned GUI elements are either switched on (if they had been
              invisible before) or off.
              Toggling the scrollbars may behave erratically with the Xaw widgets; e.g. the scrollbars may  reappear
              after resizing the window, and at certain window sizes one of the scrollbars may fail to disappear.
              See  also the option -expertmode (the numbers above correspond to the bits in the argument to -expert‐
              mode).

MOUSE ACTIONS IN THE MAIN WINDOW
       The mouse actions can be customized by setting the X resource mouseTranslations.  Since there are three  dif‐
       ferent  mouse  modes (see the section MODES below), there is a special action mouse-modes which lists the ac‐
       tions for each  of  the  three  modes:  mouse-modes("ACTIONS-FOR-MODE1",  "ACTIONS-FOR-MODE2",  "ACTIONS-FOR-
       MODE3").   If only one argument is specified, this action is used for all modes.  The default bindings are as
       follows:

            xdvi.mouseTranslations: \
            Shift<Btn1Down>:mouse-modes("drag(+)")\n\
            Shift<Btn2Down>:mouse-modes("drag(|)")\n\
            Shift<Btn3Down>:mouse-modes("drag(-)")\n\
            Ctrl<Btn1Down>:mouse-modes("source-special()")\n\
            <Btn1Down>: mouse-modes("do-href()magnifier(*2)", "text-selection()", "ruler()")\n\
            <Btn2Down>: mouse-modes("do-href-newwindow()magnifier(*2)", "text-selection()", "ruler()")\n\
            <Btn3Down>: mouse-modes("magnifier(*3)")\n\
            <Btn4Down>: mouse-modes("wheel(-0.2)")\n\
            <Btn5Down>: mouse-modes("wheel(0.2)")\n\
            <Btn6Down>: mouse-modes("hwheel(-0.2)")\n\
            <Btn7Down>: mouse-modes("hwheel(0.2)")\n\

       All of these actions are described in more detail below.  Note the use of quote  symbols  around  the  action
       strings,  which  are  necessary to group them into one argument.  Buttons 4, 5, 6, and 7 refer to wheel move‐
       ments (wheel up/down/left/right) on wheel mice.  Not all mice support horizontal scrolling.

       The X Toolkit routines that implement translations do not support event types of Btn6Down or  Btn7Down.   Be‐
       cause  of  this,  xdvi implements its own parser for translations given in mouseTranslations.  This parser is
       more limited than the parser built in to the X Toolkit.  The string given in mouseTranslations should not be‐
       gin  with ``#replace'', ``#augment'', or ``#override''.  Modifiers of the form @keysym are not supported, and
       the event type must be of the form BtnDown or BtnnDown, where n is a positive integer without leading zeroes.
       Also, some limitations apply to the action field.

       do-href()

       do-href-newwindow()
              Usually,  if a binding specifies more then one action, all actions are executed in a sequence. The hy‐
              perlink bindings do-href() and do-href-newwindow() are special in that they are used as an alternative
              to  other  actions  that  might follow them if the mouse is currently located on a hyperlink.  In this
              case, none of the other actions will be executed; otherwise, only the other actions are executed.
              The action do-href() jumps to the link target in the current xdvi window (eventually switching to  an‐
              other page), and do-href-newwindow() opens a new instance of xdvi for the link target.  In both cases,
              the location of the target is indicated by a small arrow drawn in the same color as a visited link  in
              the left corner of the window.

       magnifier(n x m)

       magnifier(*n)
              This action will pop up a ``magnifying glass'' which shows the unshrunk image of the region around the
              mouse pointer.  The magnifier disappears when the mouse button is released. Moving  the  mouse  cursor
              while holding the button down will move the magnifier.
              Different  mouse buttons produce different sized windows, as indicated by the the argument of the mag‐
              nifier() action. Its argument is either a string of the form widthxheight, as in  the  -mgsn  command-
              line  option, or one of the strings *1 through *5, referring to the value specified by the correspond‐
              ing -mgsn option.

       drag(+)

       drag(|)

       drag(-)
              Drags the page with the mouse. This action should have one parameter, the character ``|'',  ``-'',  or
              ``+'', indicating vertical dragging only, horizontal dragging only, or dragging in all directions.

       source-special()
              This  action  starts  a  ``reverse search'', opening the editor at the location in the TeX file corre‐
              sponding to the pointer location in the DVI file.  See the section on SOURCE SPECIALS, below, for more
              information on this.

       wheel()
              This  action  can  be  used to scroll the image with a wheel mouse, where it is usually bound to mouse
              button 4 (wheel up) or 5 (wheel down).  The action takes one parameter, giving the distance to  scroll
              the  image.   If  the parameter contains a decimal point, the distance is given in wheel units; other‐
              wise, pixels.  A negative value scrolls up, a positive value scrolls down.

       hwheel()
              This action can be used to scroll the image horizontally with a wheel mouse, where it is usually bound
              to  mouse  button  6 (wheel left) or 7 (wheel right).  The action takes one parameter, giving the dis‐
              tance to scroll the image.  If the parameter contains a decimal point, the distance is given in  wheel
              units;  otherwise,  pixels.   A  negative value scrolls left, a positive value scrolls right.  Not all
              mice support horizontal scrolling; this is mostly for touchpads, trackpads, etc.

       text-selection()
              This action allows you to mark a rectangular region of text in the DVI file.  The text is put into the
              X selection buffer and can be pasted into other applictions (e.g. text editors). This works similar to
              the Plain text option in the Save dialog; see the discussion there for more  information  on  encoding
              issues.

       ruler()
              This action creates a cross-shaped ruler. Moving the mouse and holding the button down drags the ruler
              and lets you measure distances on the page.  See the section Ruler Mode for more information on this.

UNBOUND ACTIONS
       The following actions are not bound to a key by default, but are available for customization.

       quit-confirm()
              Pops up a confirmation window to quit xdvi. To bind it to the `q' key instead of the default  `quit()'
              action, put the following into your ~/.Xdefaults file:

              xdvi.mainTranslations: #override\
              <Key>q: quit-confirm()\n

       down-or-next()
              Similar  to  unpause-or-next(): Moves down two-thirds of a window-full, or to the next page if already
              at the bottom of the page.

       shrink-to-dpi()
              This action takes one (required) argument.  It sets the shrink factor to an integer so as to  approxi‐
              mate  the  use of fonts with the corresponding number of dots per inch.  If xdvi is using fonts scaled
              for p dots per inch, and the argument to shrink-to-dpi is n, then the corresponding shrink  factor  is
              the ratio p/n, rounded to the nearest integer.

CUSTOMIZATION
       Key  and  mouse  button  assignments  can  be changed by setting the mainTranslations resource to a string of
       translations as defined in the documentation for the X toolkit.  The actions should take the form  of  action
       names listed in the KEYSTROKES and MOUSE ACTIONS sections.

       An  exception  to this are the Motif keys osfPageUp (PgUp), osfPageDown (PgDown), osfBeginLine (Home) and os‐
       fEndLine (End) which are currently not customizable in the Motif version.

       Key actions will usually be without arguments; if they are passed an argument,  it  represents  the  optional
       number or `prefix argument' typed prior to the action.

       Some key actions may take special arguments, as follows: The argument of goto-page may be the letter `e', in‐
       dicating the action of going to the end of the document.  The argument of set-shrink-factor may be the letter
       `a', indicating that the shrink factor should be set to the smallest value such that the page will fit in the
       window, or one of the signs `+' or `-', indicating that the shrink factor should be increased  or  decreased,
       respectively.   Finally,  actions that would perform a toggle, such as set-keep-flag, may receive an argument
       `t', indicating that the action should toggle regardless of the current prefix argument.

       Mouse actions should refer only to ButtonPress events (e.g.,  <Btn1Down>:magnifier(*1)).   The  corresponding
       motion  and  release  events will be handled internally.  A key action may be bound to a mouse event, but not
       vice versa.

       Usually the string of translations should begin with ``#override'', indicating that the default key and mouse
       button assignments should not be discarded.

       When  keys  or  mouse  buttons involving modifiers (such as Ctrl or Shift) are customized together with their
       non-modified equivalents, the modified keys should come first, for example:

            xdvi.mainTranslations: #override \
            Shift<Key>s: select-dvi-file()\n\
            Ctrl<Key>s: save()\n\
            <Key>s: find()\n


       Because xdvi needs to capture pointer motion events, and because the X Toolkit translations mechanism  cannot
       accommodate  both  motion events and double-click events at the same time, it is not possible to specify dou‐
       ble-click actions in xdvi customizations.  For information on this and other aspects of translations, see the
       X Toolkit Intrinsics documentation.

       There  is  no  command-line  option to set the mainTranslations resource, since changing this resource on the
       command line would be cumbersome.  To set the resource for testing purposes, use the -xrm command-line option
       provided by the X toolkit.  For example, xdvi -xrm 'XDvi.mainTranslations: #override "z":quit()' ...  or xdvi
       -xrm 'XDvi.mainTranslations: #override <Key>z:quit()' ...  will cause the key `z' to quit xdvi.

       Some resources are provided to allow customization of the geometry of the Xaw command buttons.   Again,  they
       are not changeable via command-line options, other than via the -xrm option.  All of these resources take in‐
       teger values.

       buttonSideSpacing
              The number of pixels to be placed on either side of the buttons.  The default value is 6.

       buttonTopSpacing
              The number of pixels between the top button and the top of the window.  The default value is 50.

       buttonBetweenSpacing
              The number of pixels between the buttons.  The default value is 20.

       buttonBetweenExtra
              The number of pixels of additional space to be inserted if the buttonTranslations resource string con‐
              tains an extra newline character.  The default value is 50.

       buttonBorderWidth
              The border width of the button windows.  The default value is 1.

PAGE LIST
       The  scrollable  page  list  on the right of the main window allows you to jump directly to a page in the DVI
       file.

       Mouse-1
              Jumps to the page the mouse is located on.

       Mouse-2
              [toggle-mark()] Toggle the mark of the current page. The marks are used by the `Print'  and  `Save  to
              file' dialogs to select only marked pages from the DVI file.

       When the mouse pointer is inside the page list, the mouse wheel switches to the next or previous page.

SCROLLBARS
       The  scrollbars  (if  present)  behave in the standard way:  pushing Button 2 in a scrollbar moves the top or
       left edge of the scrollbar to that point and optionally drags it; pushing Button 1  moves  the  image  up  or
       right  by  an amount equal to the distance from the button press to the upper left-hand corner of the window;
       pushing Button 3 moves the image down or left by the same amount.

       The scrollbars can be removed via the -expertmode flag/keystroke (which see).

MAGNIFIER
       By default, the mouse buttons 1 to 5 will pop up a ``magnifying glass'' that shows an unshrunken image of the
       page (i.e. an image at the resolution determined by the option/X resource pixels or mfmode) at varying sizes.
       When the magnifier is moved, small ruler-like tick marks are displayed at the edges of the magnifier  (unless
       the X resource delayRulers is set to false, in which case the tick marks will always be displayed).  The unit
       of the marks is determined by the X resource tickUnits (mm by default). This unit can be changed  at  runtime
       via  the  action switch-magnifier-units(), by default bound to the keystroke `t' (see the description of that
       key, and of switch-magnifier-units() for more details on the units available).
       The length of the tick marks can be changed via the X resource tickLength (4 by default). A zero or  negative
       value suppresses the tick marks.

PAGE HISTORY
       Xdvi  keeps a history of viewed pages, and you can move through the history and delete items using the keys [
       (pagehistory-back()), ] (pagehistory-forward()), Ctr-[ (pagehistory-delete-backward()) and Ctr-]  (pagehisto‐
       ry-delete-forward()).

       When  one  of the history commands is used, the page history is displayed in the status line at the bottom of
       the window, with the current list item marked by square brackets `[', `]' and a left and right context of  at
       most 10 items. File boundaries are marked by `#'.

       The  size  of  the  history  can  be customized with the X resource pageHistorySize (the default size is 1000
       items). If the size is set to 0, the history commands are disabled.

HYPERLINKS
       The actions do-href() and do-href-newwindow() (by default bound to Mouse-1 and Mouse-2 if the pointer is cur‐
       rently located on a hyperlink) can be used to open the link target in the same window (do-href()) or in a new
       window (do-href-newwindow()).

       If the link target is not a file on the local disk, xdvi tries to launch a web browser (as specified  by  the
       -browser  command  line option, the BROWSER environment variable or the wwwBrowser X resource, in this order)
       to retrieve the document. See the description of the BROWSER environment variable, below, for an example set‐
       ting.

       If  the file is a local file, xdvi tries to determine if it is a DVI file. If it is, xdvi will try to display
       the file; otherwise it will try to determine the MIME type of the file, and from that an application suitable
       for  opening the file.  This is done by parsing the files specified by the environment variable EXTENSIONMAPS
       for a mapping of filename extensions to MIME types, and the files  determined  by  the  environment  variable
       MAILCAPS for a mapping of MIME types to application programs.  See the descriptions of these variables in the
       section ENVIRONMENT, below, for a more detailed description and the default values of these variables. If  no
       suitable files are found, a set of built-in default MIME types and applications is used.

       Xdvi  currently  uses no heuristics apart from the filename suffix to determine the mime type of a file. If a
       filename has no suffix, the value of the resource noMimeSuffix is used  (by  default  application/x-unknown).
       If the suffix doesn't match any of the suffixes in mime.types, the value of the resource unknownMimeSuffix is
       used (by default application/x-unknown).  If the mailcap entries do not list a viewer for a given mime  type,
       xdvi  will  show  a  warning popup. If you want to avoid this warning, and for example want to always use the
       netscape browser for unknown MIME types, you could add the following line to your ~/.mailcap file:

           application/xdvi-unknown; \
               netscape -raise -remote 'openURL(%s,new-window)'


STRING SEARCH
       The keystroke Ctrl-f or the menu entry File > Find ...  (or the `Binoculars' symbol in the toolbar,  for  Mo‐
       tif)  opens  a  dialog  window to search for a text string or a regular expression in the DVI file.  The key‐
       stroke Ctrl-g jumps to the next match (like pressing the `Find' button in the search window).

       By default, the matches are highlighted in inverted color.  If the display isn't running in TrueColor, or  if
       the  X  resource  matchHighlightInverted is set to false or the command-line option -nomatchinverted is used,
       xdvi will instead draw a rectangle in highlight color (see the -hl option) around the match.

       If a match crosses a page boundary, only the part on the first page is highlighted.  Xdvi will scan up  to  2
       adjacent  pages to match strings crossing page boundaries; but note that header or footer lines, or interven‐
       ing float pages will be treated as parts of the scanned text. Such text will usually cause multi-page  match‐
       ing to fail.

       This emphasizes the fact that searching in the formatted text (the DVI output) works differently from search‐
       ing in the source text: Searching in the DVI file makes it easier to skip formatting instructions, and  makes
       it possible to search for e.g. hyphenation and equation numbers; but sometimes the formatting results can al‐
       so get in the way, e.g. in the case of footnotes. In these cases it's better to search in the TeX source  in‐
       stead.  The  use  of source specials will make switching between the xdvi display and the editor with the TeX
       source easier; see the section SOURCE SPECIALS below for more information on this.

       The text extracted from the DVI file is in encoded in UTF-8 (you can view that text by  saving  the  file  in
       UTF-8  format  via  the File > Save as ...  menu item).  If xdvi has been compiled with locale, nl_langinfo()
       and iconv support, the search term is converted from the character set specified by the current  locale  into
       UTF-8.  (See  the output of locale -a for a list of locale settings available on your system).  If nl_langin‐
       fo() is not available, but iconv is, you can specify the input encoding for iconv via the X resource  textEn‐
       coding  (see  the  output of iconv -l for a list of valid encodings). If iconv support is not available, only
       the encodings ISO-8859-1 and UTF-8 are supported (these names are case-insensitive).

       Ideographic characters from CJKV fonts are treated specially: All white space (spaces  and  newlines)  before
       and after such characters is ignored in the search string and in the DVI file.

       To match a newline character, use \n in the search string; to match the string \n, use \\n.

       If  the  checkbox  Regular Expression is activated, the string is treated as a regular expression in extended
       POSIX syntax, with the following properties:

         - a? matches a zero or one times.

         - a* matches a zero or more times.

         - a+ matches a one or more times.  Note that * and + are greedy, i.e. they match the longest possible  sub‐
           string.

         - The pattern . matches any character except for newline. To also match a newline, use `(.|\n)'.

         - a{n} matches a exactly n times.

         - a{n,m} matches a at least n and no more than m times.

         - a|b matches a or b. Brackets can be used for grouping, e.g.: (a|b)|c.

         - The string matched by the nth group can be referenced by \n, e.g. \1 refers to the first match.

         - The characters ^ and $ match the beginning and the end of a line, respectively.

         - [abc] matches any of the letters a, b, c, and [a-z] matches all characters from a to z.

         - Each item in a regular expression can also be one of the following POSIX character classes:
           [[:alnum:]] [[:alpha:]] [[:blank:]] [[:cntrl:]] [[:digit:]]
           [[:graph:]] [[:lower:]] [[:print:]] [[:space:]] [[:upper:]]


           These can be negated by inserting a ^ symbol after the first bracket: [^[:alpha:]]

           For more details on POSIX regular expressions, see e.g. the IEEE Std 1003.1 standard definition available
           online from:

           http://www.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/007904975/basedefs/xbd_chap09.html

         - As a non-standard extension, the following Perl-like abbreviations can  be  used  instead  of  the  POSIX
           classes:

           Symbol   Meaning                       POSIX Class

               \w   an alphanumeric character     [[:alnum:]]
               \W   a non-alphanumeric character  [^[:alnum:]]
               \d   a digit character             [[:digit:]]
               \D   a non-digit character         [^[:digit:]]
               \s   a whitespace character        [[:space:]]
               \S   a non-whitespace character    [^[:space:]]


         - The  following characters are special symbols; they need to be escaped with \ in order to match them lit‐
           erally:  ( ) [ ] . * ? + ^ $ \.

         - Matches of length zero are silently skipped.

       The dialog also provides checkboxes to:

         - search backwards;

         - match in a case-sensitive manner (the default is to ignore case, i.e. a search  string  Test  will  match
           both the strings test and TEST in the DVI file);

         - ignore  line  breaks and hyphens: This removes all hyphens at the ends of lines and the following newline
           characters, and replaces all remaining newline characters by white spaces. So hyphenated words  will  ap‐
           pear  as  one  word to the search, and a search for two words with a space in between will also match the
           words if they are separated by a linebreak.
           Note that the hyphen removal may cause unwanted side effects for compound words containing  hyphens  that
           are  wrapped  after the hyphen, and that replacing the newlines affects the interpretation of regular ex‐
           pressions as follows: The . pattern will also match newlines, and ^ and $ won't match begin  and  end  of
           lines any more. (Since currently there is no option for turning off the greediness of * and +, turning on
           this option will usually result in matches that are longer than desired.)

       The current checkbox settings are saved in the ~/.xdvirc file.

PRINT DIALOG
       The print dialog window allows you to print all pages, marked pages (click or drag Mouse-2 in the  page  list
       to  mark  them), or a range of pages. Note that the page numbers always refer to physical pages, so if you're
       using the option `use TeX pages', you may want to disable it to make it easier to determine the correct  page
       numbers (or avoid this problem altogether by marking the pages to be printed).

       The value of the Printer text filed is passed to dvips via the -o!  mechanism, as a single argument after the
       `!'. Any arguments listed in the Dvips options field are segmented at whitespaces and passed as separate  ar‐
       guments  to  dvips.   If you e.g. want to print the file 2-up, you should enter the following string into the
       Printer field:

                psnup -2 -q | lpr -Plp


       There are several resources for customizing the behaviour and the default entries of the print dialog:

       dvipsPrinterString

       dvipsOptionsString
              These can be used to provide default entries for the Printer and the Dvips options  text  fields,  re‐
              spectively.  If  no  paper  size is specified in the DVI file (via e.g. \usepackage[dvips]{geometry} -
              this is the preferred method), the input field is initialized with the current value  of  the  command
              line  option/X resource paper.  E.g., the option -paper a4r is translated into the dvips options -t a4
              -t landscape.  Note that no check is performed whether dvips actually understands  these  options  (it
              will ignore them if it can't); currently not all options used by xdvi are also covered by dvips.

       dvipsHangTime

       dvipsFailHangTime
              These  specify  the  time (in milliseconds) that the printing progress window will stay open after the
              dvips process has terminated. The value of dvipsHangTime is used if the process terminates successful‐
              ly;  dvipsFailHangTime  is  used if it terminates with an error. The default values are 1.5 and 5 sec‐
              onds, respectively.  If both values are negative, the window will stay open until it is closed by  the
              user.

SAVE DIALOG
       This  dialog  allows you to save all or selected/marked pages in the current DVI file. You can save in one of
       the following formats:

         - PostScript (uses dvips to convert the DVI file to a PostScript file, just like when printing to  a  Post‐
           Script file).

         - PDF (first uses dvips to convert the DVI file to a PostScript file, then uses ps2pdf to convert the Post‐
           Script file to PDF).

         - Plain text in ISO-8859-1 or UTF-8 encoding. The latter will preserve more of the special LaTeX characters
           e.g.  from mathematical mode. Note however that e.g. only few of LaTeX's mathematical symbols can be ren‐
           dered correctly as text; so this funcionality works best for plain text documents.  If a character cannot
           be  displayed  in the selected charset, it is replaced by `\' followed by the hexadecimal character code.
           If a character is not recognized at all, it is replaced by `?'.

       The programs for PostScript and PDF conversion can be customized via the command line options or X  resources
       -dvipspath/.dvipsPath  and  -ps2pdfpath/.ps2pdfPath, respectively; see the explanation of these options above
       for more details.

MODES
       The keystroke Ctrl-m [switch-mode()] switches between three different mouse bindings, which can also be acti‐
       vated  via  the  Modes menu (in Motif, this is a submenu of the Options menu called Mouse Mode).  The default
       mode at startup can be customized via the X resource mouseMode or the command-line  option  -mousemode.   The
       default startup mode is Magnifier Mode.

       Note:  The  modes  are  implemented  by  changing the magnifier() action. Switching the mode will not work if
       Mouse-1 has been customized to an action sequence that does not contain the magnifier() action.

       Magnifier Mode
              In this mode, the mouse buttons 1 to 5 pop up a ``magnifying glass'' that shows an unshrunken image of
              the  page  (i.e.  an  image at the resolution determined by the option/X resource pixels or mfmode) at
              varying sizes. When the magnifier is moved, small ruler-like tick marks are displayed at the edges  of
              the magnifier (unless the X resource delayRulers is set to false, in which case the tick marks are al‐
              ways displayed).  The unit of the marks is determined by the X resource  tickUnits  (mm  by  default).
              This  unit  can be changed at runtime via the action switch-magnifier-units(), by default bound to the
              keystroke `t' (see the description of that key, and of switch-magnifier-units() for  more  details  on
              the units available).
              The  length  of  the tick marks can be changed via the X resource tickLength (4 by default). A zero or
              negative value suppresses the tick marks.

       Text Selection Mode
              This mode allows you to select a rectangular region of text in the DVI file by  holding  down  Mouse-1
              and moving the mouse. The text is put into the X primary selection so that it can be pasted into other
              X applications with Mouse-2 as usual.
              If xdvi has been compiled with locale, nl_langinfo() and iconv support, the selected text is converted
              into  the  character  set of the current locale (see the output of locale -a for a list of locale set‐
              tings available on your system).  If nl_langinfo() is not available, but iconv is, you can specify the
              input  encoding  for  iconv  via the X resource textEncoding (see the output of iconv -l for a list of
              valid encodings). If iconv support is not available, only the encodings ISO-8859-1 and UTF-8 are  sup‐
              ported (these names are case-insensitive).
              Note  that  UTF-8 is the only encoding that can render all characters (e.g. mathematical symbols) of a
              DVI file. If ISO-8859-1 is active, characters that cannot be displayed are replaced by `\' followed by
              the  hexadecimal  character  code.   For other encodings, such characters may trigger iconv error mes‐
              sages.  If a character is not recognized at all, it is replaced by `?'.
              To extract larger portions of text, you can alternatively save selected pages or the  entire  file  in
              text format via the File > Save as ...  menu.

       Ruler Mode
              This mode provides a simple way of measuring distances on the page.
              When  this  mode  is activated, the mouse cursor changes into a thin cross, and a larger, cross-shaped
              ruler is drawn in the highlight color at the mouse location. The ruler doesn't have units attached  to
              it;  instead,  the  current distance between the ruler and the mouse cursor is continuously printed to
              the statusline.
              When activating Ruler Mode, the ruler is at first attached to the mouse and can be  moved  around.  It
              can  then  be  positioned  at  a fixed place by clicking Mouse-1.  After that, the mouse cursor can be
              moved to measure the horizontal (dx), vertical (dy) and direct (shortest) (dr)  distance  between  the
              ruler center point and the mouse.
              Clicking  Mouse-1  again  will  move the ruler to the current mouse position, and holding down Mouse-1
              will drag the ruler around.
              In Ruler Mode, the following special keybindings extend or replace the default bindings:

              o      [ruler-snap-origin()] Snap the ruler back to the origin coordinate (0,0).

              t      [overrides switch-magnifier-units()] Toggle between various ruler units, which can be specified
                     by the X resource tickUnits (`mm' by default).

              P      [overrides  declare-page-number()] Print the distances shown in the statusline to standard out‐
                     put.

TOOLBAR (Motif only)
       The Motif toolbar can also be customized. The XPM file used for the toolbar icons can be  specified  via  the
       resource  toolbarPixmapFile,  which  should contain a filename that can be found in one of XFILESEARCHPATH or
       XDVIINPUTS (see the section FILE SEARCHING below for more information on these variables).  Xdvi will try  to
       split this pixmap horizontally into n pieces, where each piece is as wide as the pixmap is high and is treat‐
       ed as an image for toolbar button n.  This means that each icon should be  a  square,  and  that  the  entire
       pixmap should have width n x h if h is the height of the pixmap.

       The  resource  toolbarTranslations can be used to map icons/buttons to specific actions.  The resource should
       contain a string separated by newline characters, similar to the resources mainTranslations and  menuTransla‐
       tions.  Every line must contain either a spacer definition, or an icon definition:

       A  spacer definition is a string SPACER(n), where n is the number of pixels inserted as separator to the fol‐
       lowing button.

       An icon definition is a colon-separated list containing the following elements:

         - the index of an icon in the pixmap file (starting from zero);

         - a long tooltip string, displayed in the status area;

         - a short tooltip string, displayed as popup;

         - a sequence of actions to be performed when the corresponding toolbar button is pushed.

       To illustrate this, the default value of toolbarTranslations looks as follows:

            xdvi.toolbarTranslations: \
               SPACER(5)\n\

       When the mouse remains over a toolbar button for a certain period, a `tooltip' window  is  shown,  describing
       what  the  button  does  using  the  short tooltip string from the above resource. At the same time, the long
       tooltip string is displayed in the statusline.  The appearance and behaviour of these tooltips can be custom‐
       ized via the following resources:

       tipShell.background
              Background color of the tooltip window.

       tipShell.fontSet
              Font used for the tooltip.

       tipShell.waitPeriod
              The  time (in milliseconds) the mouse pointer needs to be over the button before the tooltip is shown.
              Set it to a negative value to suppress the tooltips altogether.


GREYSCALING AND COLORMAPS
       The greyscale anti-aliasing feature in xdvi will not work at its best if the display  does  not  have  enough
       colors  available.   This  can  happen if other applications are using most of the colormap (even if they are
       iconified).  If this occurs, then xdvi will print an error message and turn on the -copy option.   This  will
       result  in overstrike characters appearing wrong; it may also result in poor display quality if the number of
       available colors is very small.

       Typically this problem occurs on displays that allocate eight bits of video memory per  pixel.   To  see  how
       many bits per pixel your display uses, type xwininfo in an xterm window, and then click the mouse on the root
       window when asked.  The ``Depth:'' entry will tell you how many bits are allocated per pixel.

       Displays using at least 15 bits per pixel are typically TrueColor visuals, which do not  have  this  problem,
       since  their  colormap is permanently allocated and available to all applications.  (The visual class is also
       displayed by xwininfo.)  For more information on visual classes see the documentation for the X  Window  Sys‐
       tem.

       To  alleviate this problem, therefore, one may (a) run with more bits per pixel (this may require adding more
       video memory or replacing the video card), (b) shut down other applications that may be  using  much  of  the
       colormap and then restart xdvi, or (c) run xdvi with the -install option.

       One application which is often the cause of this problem is Netscape.  In this case there are two more alter‐
       natives to remedying the situation.  One can run ``netscape -install'' to cause Netscape to install a private
       colormap.   This  can  cause  colors to change in bizarre ways when the mouse is moved to a different window.
       Or, one can run ``netscape -ncols 220'' to limit Netscape to a smaller number of colors.   A  smaller  number
       will  ensure  that  other  applications have more colors available, but will degrade the color quality in the
       Netscape window.


HANDLING OF POSTSCRIPT FIGURES
       Xdvi can display Encapsulated PostScript (EPS) files included in the dvi file.  Such files are first searched
       for  in  the directory where the dvi file is, and then using normal Kpathsea rules.  There is an exception to
       this, however:  if the file name begins with a backtick (`), then the remaining characters in the  file  name
       give  a  shell  command (often zcat) which is executed; its standard output is then sent to be interpreted as
       PostScript.  Since the execution of arbitrary shell commands with the user's permissions is a  huge  security
       risk,  evaluation of these backtick commands is disabled by default. It needs to be activated via the -allow‐
       shell command-line option.  NOTE: You should never use this option when viewing  documents  that  you  didn't
       compile yourself. The backtick specials are not needed for uncompressing gzipped PostScript files, since xdvi
       can do that on the fly if the filename ends with .eps.gz or .eps.Z (and if the first bytes of the file  indi‐
       cate  that  the file is indeed compressed).  This is both safer and more flexible than the backtick approach,
       since the default file searching rules will apply to such filenames too.

TYPE 1 FONTS
       Using FreeType (version 2), xdvi can render PostScript<tm> Type 1 fonts directly, without the route  via  TeX
       pixel  (pk)  fonts. The advantage of this is that only one size of each font needs to be stored on disk.  Un‐
       less the -notype1fonts option is used, xdvi will try to render every font using FreeType. Only as a  fallback
       will  it  invoke an external program (like mktexpk, which in turn may invoke utilities like ps2pk or gsftopk)
       to generate a pixel font from the Type 1 source. The direct rendering of the  Computer  Modern  fonts  should
       work  out-of-the  box,  whereas other Type 1 fonts such as the 35 `standard' PostScript<tm> fonts resident in
       printers may need to be made accessible for use with xdvi, unless your system administrator or TeX  distribu‐
       tion  has  already  done  so (which is the case e.g. for current TeX Live systems). For the 35 PostScript<tm>
       resident fonts, xdvik will search using the Fontmap provided with Ghostscript, if necessary.  Also, the xdvik
       distribution comes with a utility called t1mapper to make these fonts available for xdvi; see the manual page
       for t1mapper(1) for usage details.  This program is likely to be dropped in the future, however, since it  is
       probably not needed anymore.

SPECIALS (GENERALLY)
       Any  of  the specials used by xdvi may be preceded by the characters ``xdvi:''.  Doing so does not change the
       behavior of the special under xdvi, but it tells other dvi drivers (such as e.g. dvips) to  ignore  the  spe‐
       cial.

SOURCE SPECIALS
       Some  TeX  implementations  or macro packages provide the facility to automatically include so-called `source
       specials' into a DVI file.  These contain the line number, eventually a column number, and  the  filename  of
       the  .tex  source.  This  makes  it  possible to jump from a .dvi file to the corresponding place in the .tex
       source and vice versa (also called `inverse search' - jumping from the DVI file to the TeX file is also known
       as `reverse search', and jumping from the TeX file to the DVI file as `forward search').

       To be usable with xdvi, source specials in the dvi file must have one of the following formats:

                src:line[ ]filename
                src:line:col[ ]filename
                src:line
                src:line:col
                src::col

       If filename or line are omitted, the most recent values are used.  The first source special on each page must
       be in one of the first two forms, since defaults are not inherited across pages.

       You will need a TeX implementation that provides an appropriate switch (e.g. -src) or a macro  package  (such
       as  srcltx.sty  or  srctex.sty,  available  from  CTAN:macros/latex/contrib/supported/srcltx/) to insert such
       source specials into the DVI file.

       For reverse search, the combination Ctrl-Mouse 1 will make xdvi open an editor (the value of the -editor com‐
       mand  line  option)  with the file and the line number of the .tex source. See the description of the -editor
       option for more information and example settings.

       For forward search, xdvi has a -sourceposition option that makes xdvi jump to the page in the DVI file corre‐
       sponding  to the given line (or the closest line having a source special) of the specified file and highlight
       the found region. See the description of the -sourceposition option for more details.

       More information on setting up various editors for use with source specials can be found at:

            http://xdvi.sourceforge.net/inverse-search.html


PAPERSIZE SPECIALS
       xdvi accepts specials to set the paper size for the document.  These specials should be of the form

                papersize=[*]width,height


       where width and height give the width and height of the paper, respectively.  Each of these should appear  in
       the  form  of a decimal number followed by any of the two-letter abbreviations for units accepted by TeX (pt,
       pc, in, bp, cm, mm, dd, cc, or sp).  If an asterisk (*) appears just before the width, then the  measurements
       refer  to  the  document dimensions (e.g., pt as opposed to truept).  This allows a macro package to vary the
       page size according to elements of the document; e.g.,

            \special{xdvi: papersize=*\number\wd\mybox sp,
                     \number\ht\mybox sp}


       Except for the asterisk, this format is compatible with dvips.

       The last papersize special on a page determines the size of that page.  If there is no such special on a giv‐
       en  page,  the  most  recent papersize is used, or, if there are no papersize specials on any preceding page,
       then the value of the paper resource (or -paper option on the command line) is used.  Thus the paper size may
       vary for different pages of the dvi file.

       If  the paper resource (or -paper command-line option) begins with a plus sign (`+'), then all papersize spe‐
       cials in the dvi file are ignored.

COLOR SPECIALS
       The color specials supported by xdvi are the same as those supported by dvips, except that the literal  Post‐
       Script  color  specification  (as  in  the AggiePattern example in the dvips documentation) is not supported.
       There are also some restrictions due to the way xdvi's  drawing  routines are implemented; e.g. the \colorbox
       and  \fcolorbox macros don't work with xdvi.  See the section LIMITATIONS below for more information on these
       restrictions.  Xdvi supports the same list of named colors as dvips does, namely:

       Apricot, Aquamarine, Bittersweet, Black, Blue, BlueGreen, BlueViolet, BrickRed,  Brown,  BurntOrange,  Cadet‐
       Blue,  CarnationPink,  Cerulean,  CornflowerBlue, Cyan, Dandelion, DarkOrchid, Emerald, ForestGreen, Fuchsia,
       Goldenrod, Gray, Green, GreenYellow, JungleGreen, Lavender, LimeGreen, Magenta, Mahogany, Maroon, Melon, Mid‐
       nightBlue,  Mulberry,  NavyBlue,  OliveGreen,  Orange, OrangeRed, Orchid, Peach, Periwinkle, PineGreen, Plum,
       ProcessBlue, Purple, RawSienna, Red, RedOrange,  RedViolet,  Rhodamine,  RoyalBlue,  RoyalPurple,  RubineRed,
       Salmon,  SeaGreen,  Sepia, SkyBlue, SpringGreen, Tan, TealBlue, Thistle, Turquoise, Violet, VioletRed, White,
       WildStrawberry, Yellow, YellowGreen, YellowOrange.

       Note that these names are case sensitive.

       The documentation of the LaTeX color package provides more details on how to use such  specials  with  LaTeX;
       see the dvips documentation for a detailed description of the syntax and semantics of the color specials.

SIGNALS
       When xdvi receives a SIGUSR1 signal, it rereads the dvi file.

ENVIRONMENT
       Xdvik  uses  the  same  environment variables and algorithms for searching for font files as TeX and friends.
       See the documentation for the Kpathsea library, kpathsea.dvi, for a detailed description of these.

       In addition, xdvik accepts the following variables:

       DISPLAY
              Specifies which graphics display terminal to use.

       KPATHSEA_DEBUG
              Trace Kpathsea lookups; set it to -1 (= all bits on) for complete tracing.

       EXTENSIONMAPS
              A list of files to be searched for mime types entries (as for Acrobat Reader).  Earlier entries in one
              of these files override later ones.  If this variable is not set, the following default path is used:

              $HOME/.mime.types:/etc/mime.types:\
                  /usr/etc/mime.types:/usr/local/etc/mime.types



       MAILCAPS
              A  list of files to be searched for mailcap entries, as defined by RFC 1343. See this RFC or the mail‐
              cap(4) manual page for a detailed description of the mailcap file format.  Currently, only the follow‐
              ing mailcap features are supported:

              test=command
                     The  entry  is  only  used if command can be executed via the system() call and if the system()
                     call returns with value 0 (success).  The command string may  contain  the  format  string  %s,
                     which will be replaced by the file name.

              needsterminal
                     If  this flag is used, the command will be executed in a new xterm window by prepending ``xterm
                     -e '' to the command string.

              All other fields in the mailcap entry are ignored by xdvi.  Earlier entries  in  one  of  these  files
              override later ones.  If the variable is not defined, the following default path is used:

                  $HOME/.mailcap:/etc/mailcap:/usr/etc/mailcap:\
                      /usr/local/etc/mailcap

              For  security  reasons,  some  special characters (i.e.: ( ) ` \ ;) are escaped in the argument before
              passing it to system().

       BROWSER
              Determines the web browser used to open external links (i.e., all  URLs  that  don't  start  with  the
              `file:' scheme and are not relative links in the local DVI file), and to open links for which no view‐
              er has been specified in the mailcap files. The value of this variable is a  colon-separated  list  of
              commands.  Xdvi  will try each of them in sequence until one succeeds (i.e. doesn't immediately return
              with status 0). This allows you to specify your favourite  browser  at  the  beginning,  and  fallback
              browsers  at the end. Every occurrence of %s in the string is replaced by the target URL; every occur‐
              rence of %% is replaced by a single %.  If no %s is present, the URL string is added as an extra argu‐
              ment.
              An example setting is:

              netscape -raise -remote 'openURL(%s,new-window)':xterm -e lynx %s:xterm -e wget %s:lynx %s:wget %s

              See

              http://www.catb.org/~esr/BROWSER/

              for more details on the BROWSER environment variable.

       GS_LIB A  colon-separated list of directories to search for Fontmap files, etc., as used for Ghostscript.  It
              has the same meaning as it does when running Ghostscript.  In xdvik, it is  used  when  searching  for
              font  files when the map file does not give a file name for the font (this should be quite rare).  The
              command gs -h will list the default value that Ghostscript uses.  See also the XDVI_GS_LIB environment
              variable (below).

       XDVI_GS_LIB
              This  has  the same effect as GS_LIB but affects only xdvi.  Use this when you want to use a different
              value for GS_LIB when running xdvi, but use either the compiled-in default value or some  other  value
              when running Ghostscript.  If both GS_LIB and XDVI_GS_LIB are set, then xdvi uses XDVI_GS_LIB.  To use
              the default value compiled in to xdvi while still retaining the ability to set  GS_LIB  for  use  with
              Ghostscript, you can set XDVI_GS_LIB to the empty string.

       TMPDIR The directory to use for storing temporary files created when uncompressing PostScript files.

       XEDITOR
              Determines  the  editor  command used for source special `reverse search', if neither the -editor com‐
              mand-line option nor the .editor resource are  specified.   See  the description of the  -editor  com‐
              mand line option for details on the format.

       VISUAL Determines  an  editor  to  be opened in an xterm window if neither of -editor, .editor, or XEDITOR is
              specified.

       EDITOR Determines an editor to be opened in an xterm window if neither of -editor, .editor, XEDITOR or VISUAL
              is specified.

       WWWBROWSER
              Obsolete; use BROWSER instead.

LIMITATIONS
       xdvi  accepts  many but not all types of PostScript specials accepted by dvips.  For example, it accepts most
       specials generated by epsf and psfig.  It does not, however, support bop-hook or eop-hook, nor does it  allow
       PostScript  commands to affect the rendering of things that are not PostScript (for example, the ``NEAT'' and
       rotated ``A'' examples in the dvips manual).  These restrictions are due to the design of xdvi; in all  like‐
       lihood they will always remain.

       LaTeX2e rotation specials are currently not supported.

       MetaPost files containing included text are not supported.

       Xdvi's  color  handling doesn't support the \colorbox and \fcolorbox macros;  this is not likely to change in
       the near future. This also means that e.g. colored tables (as created by the colortbl package) may render in‐
       correctly:  Text in colors different from the default foreground color may not be displayed. When the page is
       redrawn (e.g. after using the magnifier), the background color of the cells may overdraw the text.

FILES
       $HOME/.xdvirc
              A file that holds all settings that the user changed via the keys, the `Options' and the  Xaw  `Modes'
              menu and the dialogs, as X resources. These resources override the settings in $HOME/.Xdefaults.  This
              file is ignored if the -q option is used or the noInitFile X resource is set.

       config.xdvi
              An optional configuration file for the Type 1 font setup, which specifies dvips-style map  files  spe‐
              cific  to  xdvik.  If used, it should be present in the directory determined by the TEXCONFIG environ‐
              ment variable.  Its format is similar to configuration files for dvips, except that it is only scanned
              for the names of map files (p and p+ directives).
