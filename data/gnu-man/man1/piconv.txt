PICONV(1)                                 Perl Programmers Reference Guide                                 PICONV(1)



NAME
       piconv -- iconv(1), reinvented in perl

SYNOPSIS
         piconv [-f from_encoding] [-t to_encoding] [-s string] [files...]
         piconv -l
         piconv [-C N|-c|-p]
         piconv -S scheme ...
         piconv -r encoding
         piconv -D ...
         piconv -h

DESCRIPTION
       piconv is perl version of iconv, a character encoding converter widely available for various Unixen today.
       This script was primarily a technology demonstrator for Perl 5.8.0, but you can use piconv in the place of
       iconv for virtually any case.

       piconv converts the character encoding of either STDIN or files specified in the argument and prints out to
       STDOUT.

       Here is the list of options.  Each option can be in short format (-f) or long (--from).

       -f,--from from_encoding
           Specifies the encoding you are converting from.  Unlike iconv, this option can be omitted.  In such
           cases, the current locale is used.

       -t,--to to_encoding
           Specifies the encoding you are converting to.  Unlike iconv, this option can be omitted.  In such cases,
           the current locale is used.

           Therefore, when both -f and -t are omitted, piconv just acts like cat.

       -s,--string string
           uses string instead of file for the source of text.

       -l,--list
           Lists all available encodings, one per line, in case-insensitive order.  Note that only the canonical
           names are listed; many aliases exist.  For example, the names are case-insensitive, and many standard and
           common aliases work, such as "latin1" for "ISO-8859-1", or "ibm850" instead of "cp850", or "winlatin1"
           for "cp1252".  See Encode::Supported for a full discussion.

       -C,--check N
           Check the validity of the stream if N = 1.  When N = -1, something interesting happens when it encounters
           an invalid character.

       -c  Same as "-C 1".

       -p,--perlqq
       --htmlcref
       --xmlcref
           Applies PERLQQ, HTMLCREF, XMLCREF, respectively.  Try

             piconv -f utf8 -t ascii --perlqq

           To see what it does.

       -h,--help
           Show usage.

       -D,--debug
           Invokes debugging mode.  Primarily for Encode hackers.

       -S,--scheme scheme
           Selects which scheme is to be used for conversion.  Available schemes are as follows:

           from_to
               Uses Encode::from_to for conversion.  This is the default.

           decode_encode
               Input strings are decode()d then encode()d.  A straight two-step implementation.

           perlio
               The new perlIO layer is used.  NI-S' favorite.

               You should use this option if you are using UTF-16 and others which linefeed is not $/.

           Like the -D option, this is also for Encode hackers.
