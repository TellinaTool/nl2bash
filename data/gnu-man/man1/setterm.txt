SETTERM(1)                                          User Commands                                         SETTERM(1)



NAME
       setterm - set terminal attributes

SYNOPSIS
       setterm [options]

DESCRIPTION
       setterm  writes  to  standard output a character string that will invoke the specified terminal capabilities.
       Where possible terminfo is consulted to find the string to use.  Some options however (marked  "virtual  con‐
       soles  only"  below)  do  not  correspond to a terminfo(5) capability.  In this case, if the terminal type is
       "con" or "linux" the string that invokes the specified capabilities on the PC Minix virtual console driver is
       output.  Options that are not implemented by the terminal are ignored.

OPTIONS
       For boolean options (on or off), the default is on.

       For conciseness, an 8-color below is black, red, green, yellow, blue, magenta, cyan, or white.

       A 16-color is an 8-color, grey, or bright followed by red, green, yellow, blue, magenta, cyan, or white.

       The  various color options may be set independently, at least at virtual consoles, though the results of set‐
       ting multiple modes (for example, -underline and -half-bright) are hardware-dependent.

       -term terminal_name
              Overrides the TERM environment variable.

       -reset Displays the terminal reset string, which typically resets the terminal to its power on state.

       -initialize
              Displays the terminal initialization string, which typically sets the  terminal's  rendering  options,
              and other attributes to the default values.

       -cursor [on|off]
              Turns the terminal's cursor on or off.

       -repeat [on|off] (virtual consoles only)
              Turns keyboard repeat on or off.

       -appcursorkeys [on|off] (virtual consoles only)
              Sets Cursor Key Application Mode on or off. When on, ESC O A, ESC O B, etc.  will be sent for the cur‐
              sor keys instead of ESC [ A, ESC [ B, etc.  See the "vi and Cursor-Keys" section of the Text-Terminal-
              HOWTO for how this can cause problems for vi users.

       -linewrap [on|off] (virtual consoles only)
              Turns automatic line-wrapping on or off.

       -default
              Sets the terminal's rendering options to the default values.

       -foreground 8-color|default (virtual consoles only)
              Sets the foreground text color.

       -background 8-color|default (virtual consoles only)
              Sets the background text color.

       -ulcolor 16-color (virtual consoles only)
              Sets the color for underlined characters.

       -hbcolor 16-color (virtual consoles only)
              Sets the color for half-bright characters.

       -inversescreen [on|off] (virtual consoles only)
              Inverts  the  screen colors.  Foreground and background are swapped, as are underline and half-bright‐
              ness.

       -bold [on|off]
              Turns bold (extra bright) mode on or off.  Except at a  virtual  console,  -bold  off  turns  off  all
              attributes (bold, half-brightness, blink, reverse).

       -half-bright [on|off]
              Turns  dim  (half-brightness) mode on or off (see -hbcolor). Except at a virtual console, -half-bright
              off turns off all attributes (bold, half-brightness, blink, reverse).

       -blink [on|off]
              Turns blink mode on or off.  Except at a virtual console, -blink off turns off all  attributes  (bold,
              half-brightness, blink, reverse).

       -reverse [on|off]
              Turns  reverse  video  mode  on  or  off.   Except  at  a  virtual console, -reverse off turns off all
              attributes (bold, half-brightness, blink, reverse).

       -underline [on|off]
              Turns underline mode on or off (see -ulcolor).

       -store (virtual consoles only)
              Stores the terminal's current rendering options (foreground and background colors) as the values to be
              used at reset-to-default.

       -clear [all]
              Clears the screen and "homes" the cursor, as clear(1).

       -clear rest
              Clears from the current cursor position to the end of the screen.

       -tabs [tab1 tab2 tab3 ...] (virtual consoles only)
              Sets tab stops at the given horizontal cursor positions, in the range 1-160.  Without arguments, shows
              the current tab stop settings.

       -clrtabs [tab1 tab2 tab3 ...] (virtual consoles only)
              Clears tab stops from the given horizontal cursor positions, in the range 1-160.   Without  arguments,
              clears all tab stops.

       -regtabs [1-160] (virtual consoles only)
              Clears  all  tab  stops,  then sets a regular tab stop pattern, with one tab every specified number of
              positions.  Without an argument, defaults to 8.

       -blank [0-60|force|poke] (virtual consoles only)
              Sets the interval of inactivity, in minutes, after which the  screen  will  be  automatically  blanked
              (using APM if available).  Without an argument, gets the blank status (returns which vt was blanked or
              zero for unblanked vt).

              The force option keeps screen blank even if a key is pressed.

              The poke option unblank the screen.

       -dump [1-NR_CONS]
              Writes a snapshot of the given virtual console (with attributes) to the file specified  in  the  -file
              option,  overwriting its contents; the default is screen.dump.  Without an argument, dumps the current
              virtual console.  Overrides -append.

       -append [1-NR_CONS]
              Like -dump, but appends to the snapshot file instead of  overwriting  it.   Only  works  if  no  -dump
              options are given.

       -file dumpfilename
              Sets the snapshot file name for any -dump or -append options on the same command line.  If this option
              is not present, the default is screen.dump in the current directory.  A path name that exceeds  system
              maximum will be truncated, see PATH_MAX from linux/limits.h for the value.

       -msg [on|off] (virtual consoles only)
              Enables or disables the sending of kernel printk() messages to the console.

       -msglevel 1-8 (virtual consoles only)
              Sets  the  console  logging  level for kernel printk() messages.  All messages strictly more important
              than this will be printed, so a logging level of 0 has the same effect as -msg on and a logging  level
              of  8  will  print all kernel messages.  klogd(8) may be a more convenient interface to the logging of
              kernel messages.

       -powersave on|vsync
              Puts the monitor into VESA vsync suspend mode.

       -powersave hsync
              Puts the monitor into VESA hsync suspend mode.

       -powersave powerdown
              Puts the monitor into VESA powerdown mode.

       -powersave [off]
              Turns off monitor VESA powersaving features.

       -powerdown [0-60]
              Sets the VESA powerdown interval in minutes.  Without an argument, defaults to 0 (disable  powerdown).
              If  the console is blanked or the monitor is in suspend mode, then the monitor will go into vsync sus‐
              pend mode or powerdown mode respectively after this period of time has elapsed.

       -blength [0-2000]
              Sets the bell duration in milliseconds.  Without an argument, defaults to 0.

       -bfreq [freqnumber]
              Sets the bell frequency in Hz.  Without an argument, defaults to 0.

       -version
              Output version information and exit.

       -help  Output help screen and exit.
