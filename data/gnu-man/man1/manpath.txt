MANPATH(1)                                       Manual pager utils                                       MANPATH(1)



NAME
       manpath - determine search path for manual pages

SYNOPSIS
       manpath [-qgdc?V] [-m system[,...]] [-C file]

DESCRIPTION
       If  $MANPATH  is  set,  manpath  will  simply display its contents and issue a warning.  If not, manpath will
       determine a suitable manual page hierarchy search path and display the results.

       The colon-delimited path is determined  using  information  gained  from  the  man-db  configuration  file  -
       (/etc/manpath.config) and the user's environment.

OPTIONS
       -q, --quiet
              Do not issue warnings.

       -d, --debug
              Print debugging information.

       -c, --catpath
              Produce  a catpath as opposed to a manpath.  Once the manpath is determined, each path element is con‐
              verted to its relative catpath.

       -g, --global
              Produce a manpath consisting of all paths named as `global' within the man-db configuration file.

       -m system[,...], --systems=system[,...]
              If this system has access to other operating system's manual hierarchies, this option can be  used  to
              include  them  in the output of manpath.  To include NewOS's manual page hierarchies use the option -m
              NewOS.

              The system specified can be a combination of comma delimited operating system names.  To  include  the
              native  operating  system's manual page hierarchies, the system name man must be included in the argu‐
              ment string.  This option will override the $SYSTEM environment variable.

       -C file, --config-file=file
              Use this user configuration file rather than the default of ~/.manpath.

       -?, --help
              Print a help message and exit.

       --usage
              Print a short usage message and exit.

       -V, --version
              Display version information.

ENVIRONMENT
       MANPATH
              If $MANPATH is set, manpath displays its value rather than determining it on the fly.  If $MANPATH  is
              prefixed  by  a colon, then the value of the variable is appended to the list determined from the con‐
              tent of the configuration files.  If the colon comes at the end of the value in the variable, then the
              determined  list  is appended to the content of the variable.  If the value of the variable contains a
              double colon (::), then the determined list is inserted in the middle of the value,  between  the  two
              colons.

       SYSTEM If  $SYSTEM is set, it will have the same effect as if it had been specified as the argument to the -m
              option.

FILES
       /etc/manpath.config  man-db configuration file.
