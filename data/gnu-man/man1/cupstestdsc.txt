NAME
       cupstestdsc - test conformance of postscript files

SYNOPSIS
       cupstestdsc [ -h ] filename.ps [ ...  filenameN.ps ]
       cupstestdsc [ -h ] -

DESCRIPTION
       cupstestdsc  tests  the conformance of PostScript files to the Adobe PostScript Language Document Structuring
       Conventions Specification version 3.0. The results of testing and any other output are sent to  the  standard
       output. The second form of the command reads PostScript from the standard input.

LIMITATIONS
       cupstestdsc  only  validates the DSC comments in a PostScript file and does not attempt to validate the Post‐
       Script code itself.  Developers must ensure that the PostScript they generate follows the  rules  defined  by
       Adobe.  Specifically,  all  pages  must  be independent of each other, code outside page descriptions may not
       affect the graphics state (current font, color, transform matrix, etc.), and device-specific commands such as
       setpagedevice should not be used.
