NAME
       cut - remove sections from each line of files

SYNOPSIS
       cut OPTION... [FILE]...

DESCRIPTION
       Print selected parts of lines from each FILE to standard output.

       Mandatory arguments to long options are mandatory for short options too.

       -b, --bytes=LIST
              select only these bytes

       -c, --characters=LIST
              select only these characters

       -d, --delimiter=DELIM
              use DELIM instead of TAB for field delimiter

       -f, --fields=LIST
              select  only  these  fields;   also print any line that contains no delimiter character, unless the -s
              option is specified

       -n     (ignored)

       --complement
              complement the set of selected bytes, characters or fields

       -s, --only-delimited
              do not print lines not containing delimiters

       --output-delimiter=STRING
              use STRING as the output delimiter the default is to use the input delimiter

       --help display this help and exit

       --version
              output version information and exit

       Use one, and only one of -b, -c or -f.  Each LIST is made up of one range, or many ranges separated  by  com‐
       mas.   Selected  input is written in the same order that it is read, and is written exactly once.  Each range
       is one of:

       N      N'th byte, character or field, counted from 1

       N-     from N'th byte, character or field, to end of line

       N-M    from N'th to M'th (included) byte, character or field

       -M     from first to M'th (included) byte, character or field

       With no FILE, or when FILE is -, read standard input.
