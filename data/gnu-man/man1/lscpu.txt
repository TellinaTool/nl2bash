LSCPU(1)                                            User Commands                                           LSCPU(1)



NAME
       lscpu - display information on CPU architecture

SYNOPSIS
       lscpu [-hpx] [-s directory]

DESCRIPTION
       lscpu gathers CPU architecture information like number of CPUs, threads, cores, sockets, NUMA nodes, informa‐
       tion about CPU caches, CPU family, model, bogoMIPS, byte order and stepping from sysfs and /proc/cpuinfo, and
       prints  it in a human-readable format.  It supports both online and offline CPUs.  It can also print out in a
       parsable format, including how different caches are shared by different CPUs, which can be fed to other  pro‐
       grams.

OPTIONS
       -h, --help
              Print a help message.

       -p, --parse [=list]
              Print out in parsable instead of human-readable format.

              If the list argument is not given then the default backwardly compatible output is printed.  The back‐
              wardly compatible format uses two commas to separate CPU cache columns. If no CPU caches  are  identi‐
              fied, then the cache columns are not printed at all.

              The  list  argument  is  comma delimited list of the columns. Currently supported are CPU, Core, Node,
              Socket, Book and Cache columns. If the list argument is given then always all  requested  columns  are
              printed in the defined order. The Cache columns are separated by ':'.

              Note  that the optional list argument cannot be separated from the option by a space, the correct form
              is for example '-p=cpu,node' or '--parse=cpu,node'.

       -s, --sysroot directory
              Use the specified directory as system root.  This allows you to inspect a snapshot  from  a  different
              system.

       -x, --hex
              Use  hexadecimal masks for CPU sets (e.g. 0x3).  The default is to print the sets in list format (e.g.
              0,1).

BUGS
       The basic overview about CPU family, model, etc. is always based on the first CPU only.

       Sometimes in Xen Dom0 the kernel reports wrong data.
