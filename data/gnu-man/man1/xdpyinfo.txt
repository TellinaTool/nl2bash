NAME
       xdpyinfo - display information utility for X

SYNOPSIS
       xdpyinfo [-display displayname] [-queryExtensions] [-ext extension-name] [-version]

DESCRIPTION
       Xdpyinfo  is  a utility for displaying information about an X server.  It is used to examine the capabilities
       of a server, the predefined values for various parameters used  in  communicating  between  clients  and  the
       server, and the different types of screens and visuals that are available.

       By  default, numeric information (opcode, base event, base error) about protocol extensions is not displayed.
       This information can be obtained with the -queryExtensions option.  Use of this option on servers that dynam‐
       ically load extensions will likely cause all possible extensions to be loaded, which can be slow and can con‐
       sume significant server resources.

       Detailed information about a particular extension is displayed with the -ext extensionName option.  If exten‐
       sionName is all, information about all extensions supported by both xdpyinfo and the server is displayed.

       If -version is specified, xdpyinfo prints its version and exits, without contacting the X server.

ENVIRONMENT
       DISPLAY To get the default host, display number, and screen.
