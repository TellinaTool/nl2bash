T1ASM(1)                                       General Commands Manual                                      T1ASM(1)



NAME
       t1asm - assemble PostScript Type 1 font

SYNOPSIS
       t1asm [-a|-b] [-l length] [input [output]]

DESCRIPTION
       t1asm  assembles  Adobe  Type  1  font  programs into either PFA (hexadecimal) or PFB (binary) formats from a
       human-readable form. If the file output is not specified output goes to the  standard  output.  If  the  file
       input is not specified input comes from the standard input.

       t1asm  tokenizes the charstring data and performs eexec and charstring encryption as specified in the ``black
       book,'' Adobe Type 1 Font Format.

       The input must have a line of the form
              /-|{string currentfile exch readstring pop}executeonly def
       which defines the command, in this case `-|', that is to start charstring data. It is an error not to  define
       such a command. Another common name for this command is `RD'.

       After  the  start  of  the Subrs array in the input, all open braces `{' not in a comment begin a charstring.
       Such a charstring is terminated by the next non-comment close brace `}'. Within such a charstring, only  com‐
       ments,  integers,  and  valid charstring commands are allowed. Valid charstring command names can be found in
       Adobe Type 1 Font Format and other documents describing the  newer  Type  2  opcodes.  The  format  within  a
       charstring is unimportant as long as integers and commands are separated by at least a one whitespace (space,
       tab, newline) character. Note that within charstrings, comments are discarded because they cannot be encoded.

OPTIONS
       --pfa, -a
            Output in PFA (ASCII) format.

       --pfb, -b
            Output in PFB (binary) format. This is the default.

       --block-length=num, -l num
            PFB only: Set the maximum output block length to num.  The default length is as large as memory allows.

       --line-length=num, -l num
            PFA only: Set the maximum length of encrypted lines in the output to num.  (These are the lines consist‐
            ing wholly of hexadecimal digits.) The default is 64.

EXAMPLES
       % t1asm Utopia-Regular.raw > Utopia-Regular.pfb
       % t1asm -a Utopia-Regular.raw > Utopia-Regular.pfa

       The Type 2 Charstring Format, also available from Adobe as a PDF file, describes the newer Type 2  operators,
       which  are  also  used  in  some  multiple-master  Type  1  fonts like Adobe Jenson and Kepler.  http://part‐
