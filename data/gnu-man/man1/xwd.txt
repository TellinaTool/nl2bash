NAME
       xwd - dump an image of an X window

SYNOPSIS
       xwd  [-debug]  [-help]  [-nobdrs]  [-out  file]  [-xy]  [-frame]  [-add value] [-root | -id id | -name name ]
       [-icmap] [-screen] [-silent] [-display display]

DESCRIPTION
       Xwd is an X Window System window dumping utility.  Xwd allows X users to store window images in  a  specially
       formatted  dump file.  This file can then be read by various other X utilities for redisplay, printing, edit‐
       ing, formatting, archiving, image processing, etc.  The target window is selected by clicking the pointer  in
       the  desired  window.  The keyboard bell is rung once at the beginning of the dump and twice when the dump is
       completed.

OPTIONS
       -display display
               This argument allows you to specify the server to connect to; see X(7).

       -help   Print out the `Usage:' command syntax summary.

       -nobdrs This argument specifies that the window dump should not include the pixels that compose the X  window
               border.  This is useful in situations where you may wish to include the window contents in a document
               as an illustration.

       -out file
               This argument allows the user to explicitly specify the output file on the command line.  The default
               is to output to standard out.

       -xy     This option applies to color displays only. It selects `XY' format dumping instead of the default `Z'
               format.

       -add value
               This option specifies an signed value to be added to every pixel.

       -frame  This option indicates that the window manager frame should be included when manually selecting a win‐
               dow.

       -root   This  option indicates that the root window should be selected for the window dump, without requiring
               the user to select a window with the pointer.

       -id id  This option indicates that the window with the specified resource id should be selected for the  win‐
               dow dump, without requiring the user to select a window with the pointer.

       -name name
               This  option indicates that the window with the specified WM_NAME property should be selected for the
               window dump, without requiring the user to select a window with the pointer.

       -icmap  Normally the colormap of the chosen window is used to obtain RGB  values.   This  option  forces  the
               first installed colormap of the screen to be used instead.

       -screen This  option  indicates that the GetImage request used to obtain the image should be done on the root
               window, rather than directly on the specified window.  In this way, you can obtain  pieces  of  other
               windows  that overlap the specified window, and more importantly, you can capture menus or other pop‐
               ups that are independent windows but appear over the specified window.

       -silent Operate silently, i.e. don't ring any bells before and after dumping the window.

ENVIRONMENT
       DISPLAY To get default host and display number.

FILES
       XWDFile.h
               X Window Dump File format definition file.
