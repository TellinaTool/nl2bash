NAME
       crl - CRL utility

SYNOPSIS
       openssl crl [-inform PEM|DER] [-outform PEM|DER] [-text] [-in filename] [-out filename] [-noout] [-hash]
       [-issuer] [-lastupdate] [-nextupdate] [-CAfile file] [-CApath dir]

DESCRIPTION
       The crl command processes CRL files in DER or PEM format.

COMMAND OPTIONS
       -inform DER|PEM
           This specifies the input format. DER format is DER encoded CRL structure. PEM (the default) is a base64
           encoded version of the DER form with header and footer lines.

       -outform DER|PEM
           This specifies the output format, the options have the same meaning as the -inform option.

       -in filename
           This specifies the input filename to read from or standard input if this option is not specified.

       -out filename
           specifies the output filename to write to or standard output by default.

       -text
           print out the CRL in text form.

       -noout
           don't output the encoded version of the CRL.

       -hash
           output a hash of the issuer name. This can be use to lookup CRLs in a directory by issuer name.

       -issuer
           output the issuer name.

       -lastupdate
           output the lastUpdate field.

       -nextupdate
           output the nextUpdate field.

       -CAfile file
           verify the signature on a CRL by looking up the issuing certificate in file

       -CApath dir
           verify the signature on a CRL by looking up the issuing certificate in dir. This directory must be a
           standard certificate directory: that is a hash of each subject name (using x509 -hash) should be linked
           to each certificate.

NOTES
       The PEM CRL format uses the header and footer lines:

        -----BEGIN X509 CRL-----
        -----END X509 CRL-----

EXAMPLES
       Convert a CRL file from PEM to DER:

        openssl crl -in crl.pem -outform DER -out crl.der

       Output the text form of a DER encoded certificate:

        openssl crl -in crl.der -text -noout

BUGS
       Ideally it should be possible to create a CRL using appropriate options and files too.
