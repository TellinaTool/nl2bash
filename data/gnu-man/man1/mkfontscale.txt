MKFONTSCALE(1)                                 General Commands Manual                                MKFONTSCALE(1)



NAME
       mkfontscale - create an index of scalable font files for X

SYNOPSIS
       mkfontscale [ -b ] [ -s ] [ -o filename ] [ -x suffix ] [ -a encoding ] ... [ -f fuzz ] [ -l ] [ -e directory
       ] [ -p prefix ] [ -r prefix ] [ -n prefix ] [ -u | -U ] [ -- ] [ directory ] ...

DESCRIPTION
       For each directory argument, mkfontscale reads all of the scalable font files in the  directory.   For  every
       font  file  found, an X11 font name (XLFD) is generated, and is written together with the file name to a file
       fonts.scale in the directory.

       The resulting fonts.scale file should be checked and possibly manually edited before being used as input  for
       the mkfontdir(1) program.

OPTIONS
       -b     read bitmap fonts.  By default, bitmap fonts are ignored.

       -s     ignore  scalable  fonts.   By  default, scalable fonts are read.  If -b is set, this flag has the side
              effect of enabling the reading of fonts.scale files.

       -o filename
              send program output to filename; default is fonts.scale if  bitmap  fonts  are  not  being  read,  and
              fonts.dir  if  they are.  If filename is relative, it is created in the directory being processed.  If
              it is the special value -, output is written to standard output.

       -x suffix
              exclude all files with the specified suffix.

       -a encoding
              add encoding to the list of encodings searched for.

       -f fuzz
              set the fraction of characters that may be missing in large encodings to fuzz  percent.   Defaults  to
              2%.

       -l     Write  fonts.dir  files  suitable for implementations that cannot reencode legacy fonts (BDF and PCF).
              By default, it is assumed that the implementation can reencode Unicode-encoded legacy fonts.

       -e     specifies a directory with encoding files.  Every such directory is scanned for  encoding  files,  the
              list of which is then written to an "encodings.dir" file in every font directory.

       -p     Specifies  a  prefix  that  is  prepended to the encoding file path names when they are written to the
              "encodings.dir" file.  The prefix is prepended literally: if a `/' is required between the prefix  and
              the path names, it must be supplied explicitly as part of the prefix.

       -r     Keep  non-absolute  encoding directories in their relative form when writing the "encodings.dir" file.
              The default is to convert relative encoding directories to absolute directories by prepending the cur‐
              rent directory.  The positioning of this options is significant, as this option only applies to subse‐
              quent -e options.

       -n     do not scan for fonts, do not write font directory files.   This  option  is  useful  when  generating
              encoding directories only.

       -u, -U disable (-u) or enable (-U) indexing of ISO 10646:1 font encodings (default: enabled).

       --     end of options.

NOTES
       The  format  of  the  fonts.scale, fonts.dir and encodings.dir files is documented in the mkfontdir(1) manual
       page.

       Mkfontscale will overwrite any fonts.scale file even if it has been hand-edited.

       mkfontscale -b -s -l is equivalent to mkfontdir.

AUTHOR
       The version of mkfontscale included in this X.Org  Foundation  release  was  originally  written  by  Juliusz
       Chroboczek  <jch@freedesktop.org> for the XFree86 project.  The functionality of this program was inspired by
       the ttmkfdir utility by Joerg Pommnitz.
