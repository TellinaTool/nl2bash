NAME
       patgen - generate patterns for TeX hyphenation

SYNOPSIS
       patgen dictionary_file pattern_file patout_file translate_file

DESCRIPTION
       This  manual  page  is not meant to be exhaustive.  See also the Info file or manual Web2C: A TeX implementa‐
       tion.

       The patgen program reads the dictionary_file containing a list of hyphenated words and the pattern_file  con‐
       taining previously-generated patterns (if any) for a particular language (not a complete TeX source file; see
       below), and produces the patout_file with (previously- plus newly-generated) hyphenation  patterns  for  that
       language.  The  translate_file  defines  language  specific  values  for  the  parameters left_hyphen_min and
       right_hyphen_min used by TeX's hyphenation algorithm and the external representation of the lower  and  upper
       case  version(s) of all `letters' of that language. Further details of the pattern generation process such as
       hyphenation levels and pattern lengths are requested interactively from the user's terminal. Optionally  pat‐
       gen  creates a new dictionary file pattmp.n showing the good and bad hyphens found by the generated patterns,
       where n is the highest hyphenation level.

       The patterns generated by patgen can be read by initex for use in hyphenating words. For a real-life  example
       of  patgen's  output,  see $TEXMFMAIN/tex/generic/hyphen/hyphen.tex, which contains the patterns TeX uses for
       English by default.  At some sites, patterns for (many) other languages may be available, and the  local  tex
       programs may have them preloaded.

       All filenames must be complete; no adding of default extensions or path searching is done.

FILE FORMATS
       Letters
           When  initex  digests hyphenation patterns, TeX first expands macros and the result must entirely consist
           of digits (hyphenation levels), dots (`.', edge of a word), and letters. In pattern files for non-English
           languages  letters  are  often  represented by macros or other expandable constructs.  For the purpose of
           patgen these are just character sequences, subject to the condition that no such sequence is a prefix  of
           another one.

       Dictionary file
           A dictionary file contains a weighted list of hyphenated words, one word per line starting in column 1. A
           digit in column 1 indicates a global word weight (initially =1) applicable to all following words  up  to
           the next global word weight. A digit at some intercharacter position indicates a weight for that position
           only.

           The hyphens in a word are indicated by `-', `*', or `.' (or their replacements as defined in  the  trans‐
           late  file)  for  hyphens  yet  to  be found, `good' hyphens (correctly found by the patterns), and `bad'
           hyphens (erroneously found by the patterns) respectively; when reading a dictionary file `*'  is  treated
           like `-' and `.' is ignored.

       Pattern file
           A  pattern  file contains only patterns in the format above, e.g., from a previous run of patgen.  It may
           not contain any TeX comments or control sequences.  For instance, this is not a valid pattern file:

           % this is a pattern file read by TeX.
           \patterns{%
            ...
           }
           It can only contain the actual patterns, i.e., the `...'.

       Translate file
           A translate  file  starts  with  a  line  containing  the  values  of  left_hyphen_min  in  columns  1-2,
           right_hyphen_min in columns 3-4, and either a blank or the replacement for one of the "hyphen" characters
           `-', `*', and `.' in columns 5, 6, and 7. (Input lines are padded with blanks as  for  many  TeX  related
           programs.)

           Each  following  line defines one `letter': an arbitrary delimiter character in column 1, followed by one
           or more external representations of that character (first the `lower' case one used for output), each one
           terminated by the delimiter and the whole sequence terminated by another delimiter.

           If  the  translate file is empty, the values left_hyphen_min=2, right_hyphen_min=3, and the 26 lower case
           letters a...z with their upper case representations A...Z are assumed.

       Terminal input
           After reading the translate_file and any previously-generated patterns from pattern_file, patgen requests
           input from the user's terminal.

           First  the  integer  values  of  hyph_start and hyph_finish, the lowest and highest hyphenation level for
           which patterns are to be generated. The value of hyph_start should be larger than any  hyphenation  level
           already present in pattern_file.

           Then,  for  each  hyphenation  level,  the  integer  values of pat_start and pat_finish, the smallest and
           largest pattern length to be analyzed, as well as good weight, bad weight, and threshold, the weights for
           good and bad hyphens and a weight threshold for useful patterns.

           Finally the decision (`y' or `Y' vs. anything else) whether or not to produce a hyphenated word list.

AUTHORS
       Frank Liang wrote the first version of this program.  Peter Breitenlohner made a substantial revision in 1991
       for  TeX  3.  The first version was published as the appendix to the TeXware technical report. Howard Trickey
       originally ported it to Unix.
