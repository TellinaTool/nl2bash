NAME
       avahi-publish-service  - Register an mDNS/DNS-SD service or host name or address mapping using the Avahi dae‐
       mon

SYNOPSIS
       avahi-publish -s [options] name service-type port [TXT data ...]

       avahi-publish-service [options] name service-type port [TXT data ...]

       avahi-publish -a [options] host name address

       avahi-publish-address [options] host name address

DESCRIPTION
       Register an mDNS/DNS-SD service or host name/address mapping using the Avahi daemon.

OPTIONS
       When calling in service registration mode, specify a DNS-SD service name (e.g. "Lennart's Files"), a  service
       type (e.g. _http._tcp) and an IP port number for the service, optionally followed by any number of TXT record
       strings on the command line. When calling in address/host name registration mode specify  a  fully  qualified
       host name and an address (IPv4 or IPv6).

       -s | --service
              Register a service. avahi-publish-service is equivalent to avahi-publish -s.

       -a | --address
              Register an address/host name mapping. avahi-publish-address is equivalent to avahi-publish -a.

       -v | --verbose
              Enable verbose mode.

       -H | --host= HOSTNAME
              Specify  a  host  name  for  this service, in case it doesn't reside on the local host. This host name
              needs to be fully qualified and resolvable using mDNS or unicast DNS.

       -d | --domain= DOMAIN
              Publish the service in the specified domain. If omitted the  Avahi  daemon  will  publish  it  in  its
              default domain (usually .local).

       --subtype= SUBTYPE
              Register the service with an additional subtype in addition to the main type. DNS-SD subtypes have the
              form _anon._sub._ftp._tcp, where _anon is the identifier of the subtype  and  _ftp._tcp  is  the  main
              type. You may pass this option multiple times to register the service with multiple subtypes.

       -f | --no-fail
              Don't  fail if the daemon is not found running. Instead, wait until it appears. If it disconnects, try
              to reconnect.

       -h | --help
              Show help

       -V | --version
              Show version information.
