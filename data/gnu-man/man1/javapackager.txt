NAME
       javapackager - Performs tasks related to packaging and signing Java and JavaFX applications.

SYNOPSIS
           javapackager command [options]

       command
           The task that should be performed.

       options
           One or more options for the command separated by spaces.

COMMANDS
       You can specify one of the following commands. After the command, specify the options for it.

       -createbss
           Converts CSS files into binary form.

       -createjar
           Produces a JAR archive according to other parameters.

       -deploy
           Assembles the application package for redistribution. By default, the deploy task generates the base
           application package, but it can also generate a self-contained application package if requested.

       -makeall
           Performs compilation, createjar, and deploy steps as one call, with most arguments predefined, and
           attempts to generate all applicable self-contained application packages. The source files must be located
           in a folder called src, and the resulting files (JAR, JNLP, HTML, and self-contained application
           packages) are put in a folder called dist. This command can only be configured in a minimal way and is as
           automated as possible.

       -signjar
           Signs JAR file(s) with a provided certificate.

OPTIONS FOR THE CREATEBSS COMMAND
       -outdir dir
           Name of the directory that will receive generated output files.

ARGUMENTS FOR SELF-CONTAINED APPLICATION BUNDLERS
       The -B option for the -deploy command is used to specify arguments for the bundler that is used to create
       self-contained applications. Each type of bundler has its own set of arguments.

   General Bundler Arguments
       appVersion=version
           Version of the application package. Some bundlers restrict the format of the version string.

       classPath=path
           Class path relative to the assembled application directory. The path is typically extracted from the JAR
           file manifest, and does not need to be set if you are using the other javapackager commands.

       icon=path
           Location of the default icon to be used for launchers and other assists. For OS X, the format must be
           .icns. For Linux, the format must be .png.

       identifier=value
           Default value that is used for other platform-specific values such as mac.CFBundleIdentifier. Reverse DNS
           order is recommended, for example, com.example.application.my-application.

       jvmOptions=option
           Option to be passed to the JVM when the application is run. Any option that is valid for the java command
           can be used. To pass more than one option, use multiple instances of the -B option, as shown in the
           following example:

               -BjvmOptions=-Xmx128m -BjvmOptions=-Xms128m


       jvmProperties=property=value
           Java System Property to be passed to the VM when the application is run. Any property that is valid for
           the -D option of the java command can be used. Specify both the property name and the value for the
           property. To pass more than one property, use multiple instances of the -B option, as shown in the
           following example:

               -BjvmProperties=apiUserName=example -BjvmProperties=apiKey=abcdef1234567890


       mainJar=filename
           Name of the JAR file that contains the main class for the application. The file name is typically
           extracted from the JAR file manifest, and does not need to be set if you are using the other javapackager
           commands.

       preferencesID=node
           Preferences node to examine to check for JVM options that the user can override. The node specified is
           passed to the application at run time as the option -Dapp.preferences.id. This argument is used with the
           userJVMOptions argument.

       runtime=path
           Location of the JRE or JDK to include in the package bundle. Provide a file path to the root folder of
           the JDK or JRE. To use the system default JRE, do not provide a path, as shown in the following example:

               -Bruntime=


       userJvmOptions=option=value
           JVM options that users can override. Any option that is valid for the java command can be used. Specify
           both the option name and the value for the option. To pass more than one option, use multiple instances
           of the -B option, as shown in the following example:

               -BuserJvmOptions=-Xmx=128m -BuserJvmOptions=-Xms=128m


   OS X Application Bundler Arguments
       mac.category=category

           website.

       mac.CFBundleIdentifier=value
           Value stored in the info plist for CFBundleIdentifier. This value must be globally unique and contain
           only letters, numbers, dots, and dashes. Reverse DNS order is recommended, for example,
           com.example.application.my-application.

       mac.CFBundleName=name
           Name of the application as it appears on the OS X Menu Bar. A name of less than 16 characters is
           recommended. The default is the name attribute.

       mac.CFBundleVersion=value
           Version number for the application, used internally. The value must be at least one integer and no more
           than three integers separated by periods (.) for example, 1.3 or 2.0.1. The value can be different than
           the value for the appVersion argument. If the appVersion argument is specified with a valid value and the
           mac.CFBundleVersion argument is not specified, then the appVersion value is used. If neither argument is
           specified, 100 is used as the version number.

       mac.signing-key-developer-id-app=key
           Name of the signing key used for Devleloper ID or Gatekeeper signing. If you imported a standard key from
           the Apple Developer Website, then that key is used by default. If no key can be identified, then the
           application is not signed.

       mac.bundle-id-signing-prefix=prefix

       image to be mounted.

       licenseFile=path
           Location of the End User License Agreement (EULA) to be presented or recorded by the bundler. The path is
           relative to the packaged application resources, for example, -BlicenseFile=COPYING.

       systemWide=boolean
           Flag that indicates which drag-to-install target to use. Set to true to show the Applications folder. Set
           to false to show the Desktop folder. The default is true.

       mac.CFBundleVersion=value
           Version number for the application, used internally. The value must be at least one integer and no more
           than three integers separated by periods (.) for example, 1.3 or 2.0.1. The value can be different than
           the value for the appVersion argument. If the appVersion argument is specified with a valid value and the
           mac.CFBundleVersion argument is not specified, then the appVersion value is used. If neither argument is
           specified, 100 is used as the version number.

       mac.dmg.simple=boolean
           Flag that indicates if DMG customization steps that depend on executing AppleScript code are skipped. Set
           to true to skip the steps. When set to true, the disk window does not have a background image, and the
           icons are not moved into place. If the systemWide argument is also set to true, then a symbolic link to
           the root Applications folder is added to the DMG file. If the systemWide argument is set to false, then
           only the application is added to the DMG file, no link to the desktop is added.

   OS X PKG Bundler Arguments
       The OS X PKG installer presents a wizard and shows the license file specified by licenseFile as one of the
       pages in the wizard. The user must accept the terms before installing the application.

       licenseFile=path
           Location of the End User License Agreement (EULA) to be presented or recorded by the bundler. The path is
           relative to the packaged application resources, for example, -BlicenseFile=COPYING.

       mac.signing-key-developer-id-installer=key
           Name of the signing key used for Developer ID or Gatekeeper signing. If you imported a standard key from
           the Apple Developer Website, then that key is used by default. If no key can be identified, then the
           application is not signed.

       mac.CFBundleVersion=value
           Version number for the application, used internally. The value must be at least one integer and no more
           than three integers separated by periods (.) for example, 1.3 or 2.0.1. The value can be different than
           the value for the appVersion argument. If the appVersion argument is specified with a valid value and the
           mac.CFBundleVersion argument is not specified, then the appVersion value is used. If neither argument is

       mac.app-store-entitlements=path
           Location of the file that contains the entitlements that the application operates under. The file must be
           in the format specified by Apple. The path to the file can be specified in absolute terms, or relative to
           the invocation of javapackager. If no entitlements are specified, then the application operates in a
           sandbox that is stricter than the typical applet sandbox, and access to network sockets and all files is
           prevented.

       mac.signing-key-app=key
           Name of the application signing key for the Mac App Store. If you imported a standard key from the Apple
           Developer Website, then that key is used by default. If no key can be identified, then the application is
           not signed.

       mac.signing-key-pkg=key
           Name of the installer signing key for the Mac App Store. If you imported a standard key from the Apple
           Developer Website, then that key is used by default. If no key can be identified, then the application is

       mac.CFBundleVersion=value
           Version number for the application, used internally. The value must be at least one integer and no more
           than three integers separated by periods (.) for example, 1.3 or 2.0.1. The value can be different than
           the value for the appVersion argument. If the appVersion argument is specified with a valid value and the
           mac.CFBundleVersion argument is not specified, then the appVersion value is used. If neither argument is
           specified, 100 is used as the version number. If this version is an upgrade for an existing application,
           the value must be greater than previous version number.

DEPRECATED OPTIONS
       The following options are no longer used by the packaging tool and are ignored if present.

       -runtimeversion version
           Version of the required JavaFX Runtime. Deprecated.

       -noembedlauncher
           If present, the packager will not add the JavaFX launcher classes to the JAR file. Deprecated.

NOTES
       ·   A -v option can be used with any task command to enable verbose output.

       ·   When the -srcdir option is allowed in a command, it can be used more than once. If the -srcfiles option
           is specified, the files named in the argument will be looked for in the location specified in the
           preceding srcdir option. If there is no -srcdir preceding -srcfiles, the directory from which the
           javapackager command is executed is used.

EXAMPLES
       Example 1 Using the -createjar Command

               javapackager -createjar -appclass package.ClassName
                 -srcdir classes -outdir out -outfile outjar -v

           Packages the contents of the classes directory to outjar.jar, sets the application class to
           package.ClassName.

       Example 2 Using the -deploy Command

               javapackager -deploy -outdir outdir -outfile outfile -width 34 -height 43
                 -name AppName -appclass package.ClassName -v -srcdir compiled
