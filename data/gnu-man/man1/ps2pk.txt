NAME
       ps2pk - creates a TeX pkfont from a type1 PostScript font

SYNOPSIS
       ps2pk  [ -v ] [ -eenc ] [ -Xxres ] [ -Eexpansion ] [ -Sslant  ] [ -Ppointsize ] [ -Rbaseres ] [ -raspectratio
       ] [ -Yyres ] [ -aAFMfile ] [ -mmodename ] type1 [pkfont]

DESCRIPTION
       This program renders a given type1 PostScript font at a given pointsize (default 10.0 points) and  resolution
       (default 300dpi) into a TeX pkfont.

       To  generate the pkfont ps2pk needs a valid type1 font file (for example Utopia-Regular, Utopia-Regula.pfb or
       Utopia-Regula.pfa) and its corresponding AFM-file (Utopia-Regular.afm) with the font  metrics.   The  program
       accepts  both the binary type1 format (Utopia-Regula.pfb) and its ASCII equivalent (Utopia-Regular or Utopia-
       Regula.pfa).  To locate the files, ps2pk uses the kpathsea library (see the info page on kpathsea). Addition‐
       ally, pfb and pfa files are searched for in the directory specified in the environment variable T1INPUTS, and
       afm files are searched in AFMFONTS, if they are set (the -v flag will report which filenames are looked for).

       The program will make a pkfont in which the character codes are derived from their AFM (Adobe  Font  Metrics)
       defined values.  This can be overruled by specifying an explicit encoding file via the -e option.  The encod‐
       ing file enc should contain a valid PostScript encoding containing PostScript names like /hyphen.  Here is an
       incomplete example (see afm2tfm for complete syntax):

              % This is the EC encoding.
              /ECEncoding [          % now 256 chars follow
              % 0x00
                /grave /acute /circumflex /tilde /dieresis /hungarumlaut
                /ring /caron /breve /macron /dotaccent /cedilla
                /ogonek /quotesinglbase /guilsinglleft /guilsinglright

                (Rest of lines omitted.)

              % 0xF0
                /eth /ntilde /ograve /oacute /ocircumflex /otilde
                /odieresis /oe /oslash /ugrave /uacute /ucircumflex
                /udieresis /yacute /thorn /germandbls ] def

       Options and arguments:

       -aAFMfile   Overrules the name that is used to locate the AFM file.


       -eenc       Name  of  a  file  containing an encoding scheme (default - the encoding named in the AFM-file is
                   used).  The actual PostScript name of the encoding scheme is written as a "special" at the end of
                   the pkfont.


       -Eextension The extension factor (real value, default 1.0).


       -mmodename  A modename such as would be used by METAFONT (default "Unknown mode").


       -Ppointsize The desired pointsize (real value, default 10.0 points).


       -Rbaseres   The  desired base resolution (integer value, default 300 dpi).  If this differs from the value of
                   xres, the appropriate magnification will be shown in the "specials" at the end of the pkfont.  If
                   possible,  this will be expressed as a magstep, otherwise as a real number. For example, a pkfont
                   with an xres of 329, using the default base resolution of 300, will include  the  "special"  text
                   "mag=magstep(0.5)" at the end of the font.


       -raspectratio
                   The desired aspect ratio (expression, integerY/integerX, default 300/300).  This will be shown in
                   the "specials" at the end of the pkfont.  Setting the aspect ratio creates a value for  yres  but
                   an  explicit  yres  value will take precedence.  Argument must be in "" if spaces are left around
                   `/'.


       -Sslant     The slant (real value, default 0.0).


       -Xxres      The resolution in the X direction (integer value, default 300 dpi).


       -Yyres      The resolution in the Y direction (integer value, default the value of  xres).  If  yres  differs
                   from xres, a "special" text giving the aspect ratio will be written at the end of the pkfont.


       -v          Verbose flag. (Tells what the program is doing.)


       type1       The  name  of  the PostScript type1 font.  The name of the AFM-file will be constructed from this
                   name by removing the extension (if suplied) and adding  ".afm".   The  PostScript  "FontName"  is
                   extracted from the AFM-file and written into a "special" at the end of the pkfont.


       [pkfont]    The  name of the resulting pkfont can be overruled with this name.  The default name of pkfont is
                   derived from the basename of the type1 font, the pointsize and xres.  For example `ps2pk  -P17.28
                   Utopia-Regular'  will  result in `Utopia-Regular17.300pk'.  An explicit value for the name of the
                   pkfont is necessary when the type1 font name already shows the point size, otherwise  the  point‐
                   size value is catenated on to the pkfont basename which is usually not what is wanted.


       The  following  PK  "specials"  provide an internal check on the characteristics of the pkfont, in accordance
       with the recommendations of the TeX Working Group on the TeX Directory Standard (TWG-TDS):
       "fontid=FontName", "codingscheme=Encoding", "fontfacebyte", "mag", "mode=(ps2pk)modename", "pixels-per-inch",
       and "aspect-ratio" if it is other than unity.


ACKNOWLEDGEMENT
       This program uses the type1 hinting and rendering software IBM has donated to the X-consortium.
