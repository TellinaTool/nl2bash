bdftruncate(1)                                 General Commands Manual                                bdftruncate(1)



NAME
       bdftruncate - generate truncated BDF font from ISO 10646-1-encoded BDF font

SYNOPSIS
       bdftruncate threshold < source.bdf > destination.bdf

DESCRIPTION
       bdftruncate  allows  one  to generate from an ISO10646-1 encoded BDF font other ISO10646-1 BDF fonts in which
       all characters above a threshold code value are stored unencoded.  This is often desirable because  the  Xlib
       API  and X11 protocol data structures used for representing font metric information are extremely inefficient
       when handling sparsely populated fonts.

EXAMPLE
       The command
              bdftruncate 0x3200 < 6x13.bdf > 6x13t.bdf
       will generate the file 6x13t.bdf in which all glyphs with codes >=  0x3200  will  only  be  stored  unencoded
       (i.e., they are encoded at codepoint -1).
