NAME
       ppdi - import ppd files

SYNOPSIS
       ppdi [ -I include-directory ] [ -o source-file ] ppd-file [ ppd-file2 ... ppd-fileN ]

DESCRIPTION
       ppdi  imports one or more PPD files into a PPD compiler source file.  Multiple languages of the same PPD file
       are merged into a single printer definition to facilitate accurate changes for all localizations.

       The -o option specifies the PPD source file to update. If the source file does not exist, a new  source  file
       is  created. Otherwise the existing file is merged with the new PPD file(s) on the command-line. If no source
       file is specified, the filename "ppdi.drv" is used.
