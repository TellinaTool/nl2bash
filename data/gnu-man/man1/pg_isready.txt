PG_ISREADY(1)                              PostgreSQL 9.3.16 Documentation                             PG_ISREADY(1)



NAME
       pg_isready - check the connection status of a PostgreSQL server

SYNOPSIS
       pg_isready [connection-option...] [option...]

DESCRIPTION
       pg_isready is a utility for checking the connection status of a PostgreSQL database server. The exit status
       specifies the result of the connection check.

OPTIONS
       -d dbname, --dbname=dbname
           Specifies the name of the database to connect to.

           If this parameter contains an = sign or starts with a valid URI prefix (postgresql:// or postgres://), it
           is treated as a conninfo string. See Section 31.1.1, “Connection Strings”, in the documentation for more
           information.

       -h hostname, --host=hostname
           Specifies the host name of the machine on which the server is running. If the value begins with a slash,
           it is used as the directory for the Unix-domain socket.

       -p port, --port=port
           Specifies the TCP port or the local Unix-domain socket file extension on which the server is listening
           for connections. Defaults to the value of the PGPORT environment variable or, if not set, to the port
           specified at compile time, usually 5432.

       -q, --quiet
           Do not display status message. This is useful when scripting.

       -t seconds, --timeout=seconds
           The maximum number of seconds to wait when attempting connection before returning that the server is not
           responding. Setting to 0 disables. The default is 3 seconds.

       -U username, --username=username
           Connect to the database as the user username instead of the default.

       -V, --version
           Print the pg_isready version and exit.

       -?, --help
           Show help about pg_isready command line arguments, and exit.

EXIT STATUS
       pg_isready returns 0 to the shell if the server is accepting connections normally, 1 if the server is
       rejecting connections (for example during startup), 2 if there was no response to the connection attempt, and
       3 if no attempt was made (for example due to invalid parameters).

ENVIRONMENT
       pg_isready, like most other PostgreSQL utilities, also uses the environment variables supported by libpq (see
       Section 31.14, “Environment Variables”, in the documentation).

NOTES
       The options --dbname and --username can be used to avoid gratuitous error messages in the logs, but are not
       necessary for proper functionality.

EXAMPLES
       Standard Usage:

           $ pg_isready
           /tmp:5432 - accepting connections
           $ echo $?
           0

       Running with connection parameters to a PostgreSQL cluster in startup:

           $ pg_isready -h localhost -p 5433
           localhost:5433 - rejecting connections
           $ echo $?
           1

       Running with connection parameters to a non-responsive PostgreSQL cluster:

           $ pg_isready -h someremotehost
           someremotehost:5432 - no response
           $ echo $?
           2
