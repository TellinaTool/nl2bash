DESCRIPTION
       xsltproc is a command line tool for applying XSLT stylesheets to XML documents. It is part of libxslt(3), the
       XSLT C library for GNOME. While it was developed as part of the GNOME project, it can operate independently
       of the GNOME desktop.

       xsltproc is invoked from the command line with the name of the stylesheet to be used followed by the name of
       the file or files to which the stylesheet is to be applied. It will use the standard input if a filename
       provided is -

       If a stylesheet is included in an XML document with a Stylesheet Processing Instruction, no stylesheet need
       to be named at the command line.  xsltproc will automatically detect the included stylesheet and use it.

       By default, output is to stdout. You can specify a file for output using the -o or --output option.

OPTIONS
       xsltproc accepts the following options (in alphabetical order):

       --catalogs
           Use the SGML catalog specified in SGML_CATALOG_FILES to resolve the location of external entities. By
           default, xsltproc looks for the catalog specified in XML_CATALOG_FILES. If that is not specified, it uses
           /etc/xml/catalog.

       --debug
           Output an XML tree of the transformed document for debugging purposes.

       --dumpextensions
           Dumps the list of all registered extensions on stdout.

       --html
           The input document is an HTML file.

       --load-trace
           Display all the documents loaded during the processing to stderr.

       --maxdepth VALUE
           Adjust the maximum depth of the template stack before libxslt(3) concludes it is in an infinite loop. The
           default is 3000.

       --nodtdattr
           Do not apply default attributes from the document´s DTD.

       --nomkdir
           Refuses to create directories.

       --nonet
           Do not use the Internet to fetch DTDs, entities or documents.

       --noout
           Do not output the result.

       --novalid
           Skip loading the document´s DTD.

       --nowrite
           Refuses to write to any file or resource.

       -o or --output FILE | DIRECTORY
           Direct output to the given FILE. Using the option with a DIRECTORY directs the output files to the
           specified directory. This can be useful for multiple outputs (also known as "chunking") or manpage
           processing.

           Important
           The given directory must already exist.

           Note
           Make sure that FILE and DIRECTORY follow the “URI reference computation” as described in RFC 2396 and
           laters. This means, that e.g.  -o directory will maybe not work, but -o directory/ will.

       --encoding ENCODING
           Allow to specify the encoding for the input.

       --param PARAMNAME PARAMVALUE
           Pass a parameter of name PARAMNAME and value PARAMVALUE to the stylesheet. You may pass multiple
           name/value pairs up to a maximum of 32. If the value being passed is a string, you can use --stringparam
           instead, to avoid additional quote characters that appear in string expressions. Note: the XPath
           expression must be UTF-8 encoded.

       --path "PATH(S)"
           Use the (space- or colon-separated) list of filesystem paths specified by PATHS to load DTDs, entities or
           documents. Enclose space-separated lists by quotation marks.

       --profile or --norman
           Output profiling information detailing the amount of time spent in each part of the stylesheet. This is
           useful in optimizing stylesheet performance.

       --repeat
           Run the transformation 20 times. Used for timing tests.

       --stringparam PARAMNAME PARAMVALUE
           Pass a parameter of name PARAMNAME and value PARAMVALUE where PARAMVALUE is a string rather than a node
           identifier.  Note: The string must be UTF-8 encoded.

       --timing
           Display the time used for parsing the stylesheet, parsing the document and applying the stylesheet and
           saving the result. Displayed in milliseconds.

       -v or --verbose
           Output each step taken by xsltproc in processing the stylesheet and the document.

       -V or --version
           Show the version of libxml(3) and libxslt(3) used.

       --writesubtree PATH
           Allow file write only within the PATH subtree.

       --xinclude
           Process the input document using the XInclude specification. More details on this can be found in the
           XInclude specification: http://www.w3.org/TR/xinclude/

ENVIRONMENT
       SGML_CATALOG_FILES
           SGML catalog behavior can be changed by redirecting queries to the user´s own set of catalogs. This can
           be done by setting the SGML_CATALOG_FILES environment variable to a list of catalogs. An empty one should
           deactivate loading the default /etc/sgml/catalog catalog.

       XML_CATALOG_FILES
           XML catalog behavior can be changed by redirecting queries to the user´s own set of catalogs. This can be
           done by setting the XML_CATALOG_FILES environment variable to a list of catalogs. An empty one should
           deactivate loading the default /etc/xml/catalog catalog.
