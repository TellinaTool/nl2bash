KBD_MODE(1)                                    General Commands Manual                                   KBD_MODE(1)



NAME
       kbd_mode - report or set the keyboard mode

SYNOPSIS
       kbd_mode [ -a | -u | -k | -s ] [ -C CONSOLE ]

DESCRIPTION
       Without  argument,  kbd_mode  prints  the current keyboard mode (RAW, MEDIUMRAW or XLATE).  With argument, it
       sets the keyboard mode as indicated:

       -s: scancode mode (RAW),

       -k: keycode mode (MEDIUMRAW),

       -a: ASCII mode (XLATE),

       -u: UTF-8 mode (UNICODE).

       Of course the "-a" is only traditional, and the code used can be any 8-bit character set.  With "-u" a 16-bit
       character  set  is expected, and these chars are transmitted to the kernel as 1, 2, or 3 bytes (following the
       UTF-8 coding).  In these latter two modes the key mapping defined by loadkeys(1) is used.

       kbd_mode operates on the console specified by the "-C" option; if there is none, the console associated  with
       stdin is used.

       Warning:  changing  the keyboard mode, other than between ASCII and Unicode, will probably make your keyboard
       unusable.  This command is only meant for use (say via remote login) when some program left your keyboard  in
       the wrong state.  Note that in some obsolete versions of this program the "-u" option was a synonym for "-s".
