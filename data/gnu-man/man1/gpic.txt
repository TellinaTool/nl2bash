NAME
       pic - compile pictures for troff or TeX

SYNOPSIS
       pic [ -nvCSU ] [ filename ... ]
       pic -t [ -cvzCSU ] [ filename ... ]

DESCRIPTION
       This  manual  page  describes  the GNU version of pic, which is part of the groff document formatting system.
       pic compiles descriptions of pictures embedded within troff or TeX input files into commands that are  under‐
       stood  by  TeX  or  troff.  Each picture starts with a line beginning with .PS and ends with a line beginning
       with .PE.  Anything outside of .PS and .PE is passed through without change.

       It is the user's responsibility to provide appropriate definitions of the PS and PE macros.  When  the  macro
       package  being  used does not supply such definitions (for example, old versions of -ms), appropriate defini‐
       tions can be obtained with -mpic: These will center each picture.

OPTIONS
       Options that do not take arguments may be grouped behind a single -.  The special option -- can  be  used  to
       mark the end of the options.  A filename of - refers to the standard input.

       -C     Recognize .PS and .PE even when followed by a character other than space or newline.

       -S     Safer  mode;  do  not  execute sh commands.  This can be useful when operating on untrustworthy input.
              (enabled by default)

       -U     Unsafe mode; revert the default option -S.

       -n     Don't use the groff extensions to the troff drawing commands.  You should use this if you are using  a
              postprocessor  that  doesn't  support these extensions.  The extensions are described in groff_out(5).
              The -n option also causes pic not to use zero-length lines to draw dots in troff mode.

       -t     TeX mode.

       -c     Be more compatible with tpic.  Implies -t.  Lines beginning with \ are not  passed  through  transpar‐
              ently.  Lines beginning with .  are passed through with the initial .  changed to \.  A line beginning
              with .ps is given special treatment: it takes an optional integer argument specifying the line  thick‐
              ness  (pen  size) in milliinches; a missing argument restores the previous line thickness; the default
              line thickness is 8 milliinches.  The line thickness thus specified takes effect only when a non-nega‐
              tive  line  thickness  has  not  been  specified  by  use of the thickness attribute or by setting the
              linethick variable.

       -v     Print the version number.

       -z     In TeX mode draw dots using zero-length lines.

       The following options supported by other versions of pic are ignored:

       -D     Draw all lines using the \D escape sequence.  pic always does this.

       -T dev Generate output for the troff device dev.  This is unnecessary because the troff output  generated  by
              pic is device-independent.

USAGE
       This  section  describes only the differences between GNU pic and the original version of pic.  Many of these
       differences also apply to newer versions of Unix pic.  A complete documentation is available in the file

              /usr/share/doc/groff-base/pic.ms.gz

   TeX mode
       TeX mode is enabled by the -t option.  In TeX mode, pic will define a vbox called \graph  for  each  picture.
       Use  the  figname command to change the name of the vbox.  You must yourself print that vbox using, for exam‐
       ple, the command

              \centerline{\box\graph}

       Actually, since the vbox has a height of zero (it is defined with \vtop) this will produce slightly more ver‐
       tical space above the picture than below it;

              \centerline{\raise 1em\box\graph}

       would avoid this.

       To  make the vbox having a positive height and a depth of zero (as used e.g. by LaTeX's graphics.sty), define
       the following macro in your document:

              \def\gpicbox#1{%
                 \vbox{\unvbox\csname #1\endcsname\kern 0pt}}

       Now you can simply say \gpicbox{graph} instead of \box\graph.

       You must use a TeX driver that supports the tpic specials, version 2.

       Lines beginning with \ are passed through transparently; a % is added  to  the  end  of  the  line  to  avoid
       unwanted  spaces.   You  can safely use this feature to change fonts or to change the value of \baselineskip.
       Anything else may well produce undesirable results; use at your own risk.  Lines beginning with a period  are
       not given any special treatment.

   Commands
       for variable = expr1 to expr2 [by [*]expr3] do X body X
              Set variable to expr1.  While the value of variable is less than or equal to expr2, do body and incre‐
              ment variable by expr3; if by is not given, increment variable by 1.  If expr3 is prefixed by  *  then
              variable  will  instead  be  multiplied by expr3.  The value of expr3 can be negative for the additive
              case; variable is then tested whether it is greater than or equal to expr2.   For  the  multiplicative
              case, expr3 must be greater than zero.  If the constraints aren't met, the loop isn't executed.  X can
              be any character not occurring in body.

       if expr then X if-true X [else Y if-false Y]
              Evaluate expr; if it is non-zero then do if-true, otherwise do if-false.  X can be any  character  not
              occurring in if-true.  Y can be any character not occurring in if-false.

       print arg...
              Concatenate  the arguments and print as a line on stderr.  Each arg must be an expression, a position,
              or text.  This is useful for debugging.

       command arg...
              Concatenate the arguments and pass them through as a line to troff  or  TeX.   Each  arg  must  be  an
              expression,  a  position,  or  text.   This  has a similar effect to a line beginning with . or \, but
              allows the values of variables to be passed through.  For example,

                     .PS
                     x = 14
                     command ".ds string x is " x "."
                     .PE
                     \*[string]

              prints

                     x is 14.

       sh X command X
              Pass command to a shell.  X can be any character not occurring in command.

       copy "filename"
              Include filename at this point in the file.

       copy ["filename"] thru X body X [until "word"]
       copy ["filename"] thru macro [until "word"]
              This construct does body once for each line of filename; the line is split into blank-delimited words,
              and  occurrences  of $i in body, for i between 1 and 9, are replaced by the i-th word of the line.  If
              filename is not given, lines are taken from the current input up to .PE.  If an until clause is speci‐
              fied,  lines  will  be  read only until a line the first word of which is word; that line will then be
              discarded.  X can be any character not occurring in body.  For example,

                     .PS
                     copy thru % circle at ($1,$2) % until "END"
                     1 2
                     3 4
                     5 6
                     END
                     box
                     .PE

              is equivalent to

                     .PS
                     circle at (1,2)
                     circle at (3,4)
                     circle at (5,6)
                     box
                     .PE

              The commands to be performed for each line can also be taken from a macro defined  earlier  by  giving
              the name of the macro as the argument to thru.

       reset
       reset variable1[,] variable2 ...
              Reset  pre-defined  variables  variable1,  variable2 ... to their default values.  If no arguments are
              given, reset all pre-defined variables to their default values.  Note that assigning a value to  scale
              also  causes  all  pre-defined  variables  that control dimensions to be reset to their default values
              times the new value of scale.

       plot expr ["text"]
              This is a text object which is constructed by using text as a format string for sprintf with an  argu‐
              ment of expr.  If text is omitted a format string of "%g" is used.  Attributes can be specified in the
              same way as for a normal text object.  Be very careful that you specify an appropriate format  string;
              pic does only very limited checking of the string.  This is deprecated in favour of sprintf.

       variable := expr
              This  is  similar  to = except variable must already be defined, and expr will be assigned to variable
              without creating a variable local to the current block.  (By contrast, = defines the variable  in  the
              current  block  if  it  is  not already defined there, and then changes the value in the current block
              only.)  For example, the following:

                     .PS
                     x = 3
                     y = 3
                     [
                       x := 5
                       y = 5
                     ]
                     print x " " y
                     .PE

              prints

                     5 3

       Arguments of the form

              X anything X

       are also allowed to be of the form

              { anything }

       In this case anything can contain balanced occurrences of { and }.   Strings  may  contain  X  or  imbalanced
       occurrences of { and }.

   Expressions
       The syntax for expressions has been significantly extended:

       x ^ y (exponentiation)
       sin(x)
       cos(x)
       atan2(y, x)
       log(x) (base 10)
       exp(x) (base 10, ie 10^x)
       sqrt(x)
       int(x)
       rand() (return a random number between 0 and 1)
       rand(x) (return a random number between 1 and x; deprecated)
       srand(x) (set the random number seed)
       max(e1, e2)
       min(e1, e2)
       !e
       e1 && e2
       e1 || e2
       e1 == e2
       e1 != e2
       e1 >= e2
       e1 > e2
       e1 <= e2
       e1 < e2
       "str1" == "str2"
       "str1" != "str2"

       String comparison expressions must be parenthesised in some contexts to avoid ambiguity.

   Other Changes
       A  bare  expression, expr, is acceptable as an attribute; it is equivalent to dir expr, where dir is the cur‐
       rent direction.  For example

              line 2i

       means draw a line 2 inches long in the current direction.  The `i' (or `I')  character  is  ignored;  to  use
       another measurement unit, set the scale variable to an appropriate value.

       The  maximum  width  and  height of the picture are taken from the variables maxpswid and maxpsht.  Initially
       these have values 8.5 and 11.

       Scientific notation is allowed for numbers.  For example

              x = 5e-2

       Text attributes can be compounded.  For example,

              "foo" above ljust

       is valid.

       There is no limit to the depth to which blocks can be examined.  For example,

              [A: [B: [C: box ]]] with .A.B.C.sw at 1,2
              circle at last [].A.B.C

       is acceptable.

       Arcs now have compass points determined by the circle of which the arc is a part.

       Circles, ellipses, and arcs can be dotted or dashed.  In TeX mode splines can be dotted or dashed also.

       Boxes can have rounded corners.  The rad attribute specifies the radius of the quarter-circles at  each  cor‐
       ner.   If no rad or diam attribute is given, a radius of boxrad is used.  Initially, boxrad has a value of 0.
       A box with rounded corners can be dotted or dashed.

       Boxes can have slanted sides.  This effectively changes the shape of a box from a rectangle to  an  arbitrary
       parallelogram.  The xslanted and yslanted attributes specify the x and y offset of the box's upper right cor‐
       ner from its default position.

       The .PS line can have a second argument specifying a maximum height for the picture.  If the width of zero is
       specified  the width will be ignored in computing the scaling factor for the picture.  Note that GNU pic will
       always scale a picture by the same amount vertically as well as horizontally.  This is different from the DWB
       2.0  pic  which  may scale a picture by a different amount vertically than horizontally if a height is speci‐
       fied.

       Each text object has an invisible box associated with it.  The compass points of a text object are determined
       by  this box.  The implicit motion associated with the object is also determined by this box.  The dimensions
       of this box are taken from the width and height attributes; if the width attribute is not supplied  then  the
       width  will  be taken to be textwid; if the height attribute is not supplied then the height will be taken to
       be the number of text strings associated with the object times textht.  Initially textwid and textht  have  a
       value of 0.

       In (almost all) places where a quoted text string can be used, an expression of the form

              sprintf("format", arg,...)

       can  also be used; this will produce the arguments formatted according to format, which should be a string as
       described in printf(3) appropriate for the number of arguments supplied.

       The thickness of the lines used to draw objects is controlled by the  linethick  variable.   This  gives  the
       thickness  of  lines  in  points.  A negative value means use the default thickness: in TeX output mode, this
       means use a thickness of 8 milliinches; in TeX output mode with the -c option, this means use the line thick‐
       ness  specified by .ps lines; in troff output mode, this means use a thickness proportional to the pointsize.
       A zero value means draw the thinnest possible line supported by the output device.  Initially it has a  value
       of -1.  There is also a thick[ness] attribute.  For example,

              circle thickness 1.5

       would  draw  a circle using a line with a thickness of 1.5 points.  The thickness of lines is not affected by
       the value of the scale variable, nor by the width or height given in the .PS line.

       Boxes (including boxes with rounded corners or slanted sides), circles and ellipses can be filled  by  giving
       them  an  attribute of fill[ed].  This takes an optional argument of an expression with a value between 0 and
       1; 0 will fill it with white, 1 with black, values in between with a  proportionally  gray  shade.   A  value
       greater than 1 can also be used: this means fill with the shade of gray that is currently being used for text
       and lines.  Normally this will be black, but output devices may provide a mechanism for changing this.  With‐
       out  an  argument,  then  the value of the variable fillval will be used.  Initially this has a value of 0.5.
       The invisible attribute does not affect the filling of objects.  Any text associated  with  a  filled  object
       will be added after the object has been filled, so that the text will not be obscured by the filling.

       Three  additional  modifiers  are available to specify colored objects: outline[d] sets the color of the out‐
       line, shaded the fill color, and colo[u]r[ed] sets both.  All three keywords expect a suffix  specifying  the
       color, for example

              circle shaded "green" outline "black"

       Currently,  color  support  isn't  available in TeX mode.  Predefined color names for groff are in the device
       macro files, for example ps.tmac; additional colors can be defined with the .defcolor request (see the manual
       page of troff(1) for more details).

       To  change  the  name of the vbox in TeX mode, set the pseudo-variable figname (which is actually a specially
       parsed command) within a picture.  Example:

              .PS
              figname = foobar;
              ...
              .PE

       The picture is then available in the box \foobar.

       pic assumes that at the beginning of a picture both glyph and fill color are set to the default value.

       Arrow heads will be drawn as solid triangles if the variable arrowhead is non-zero and  either  TeX  mode  is
       enabled  or  the  -n option has not been given.  Initially arrowhead has a value of 1.  Note that solid arrow
       heads are always filled with the current outline color.

       The troff output of pic is device-independent.  The -T option is therefore redundant.  All numbers are  taken
       to be in inches; numbers are never interpreted to be in troff machine units.

       Objects  can  have  an aligned attribute.  This will only work if the postprocessor is grops, or gropdf.  Any
       text associated with an object having the aligned attribute will be rotated about the center of the object so
       that  it  is  aligned  in  the direction from the start point to the end point of the object.  Note that this
       attribute will have no effect for objects whose start and end points are coincident.

       In places where nth is allowed `expr'th is also allowed.  Note that 'th  is  a  single  token:  no  space  is
       allowed between the ' and the th.  For example,

              for i = 1 to 4 do {
                 line from `i'th box.nw to `i+1'th box.se
              }

CONVERSION
       To  obtain  a stand-alone picture from a pic file, enclose your pic code with .PS and .PE requests; roff con‐
       figuration commands may be added at the beginning of the file, but no roff text.

       It is necessary to feed this file into groff without adding any page information, so you must check which .PS
       and  .PE  requests  are actually called.  For example, the mm macro package adds a page number, which is very
       annoying.  At the moment, calling standard groff without any macro package  works.   Alternatively,  you  can
       define your own requests, e.g. to do nothing:

              .de PS
              ..
              .de PE
              ..

       groff itself does not provide direct conversion into other graphics file formats.  But there are lots of pos‐
       sibilities if you first transform your picture into PostScript® format using the groff  option  -Tps.   Since
       this ps-file lacks BoundingBox information it is not very useful by itself, but it may be fed into other con‐
       version programs, usually named ps2other or pstoother or the  like.   Moreover,  the  PostScript  interpreter
       ghostscript (gs) has built-in graphics conversion devices that are called with the option

              gs -sDEVICE=<devname>

       Call

              gs --help

       for a list of the available devices.

       An alternative may be to use the -Tpdf option to convert your picture directly into PDF format.  The MediaBox
       of the file produced can be controlled by passing a -P-p papersize to groff.

       As the Encapsulated PostScript File Format EPS is getting more and more important, and the conversion  wasn't
       regarded  trivial  in  the  past you might be interested to know that there is a conversion tool named ps2eps
       which does the right job.  It is much better than the tool ps2epsi packaged with gs.

       For bitmapped graphic formats, you should use pstopnm; the resulting (intermediate) PNM file can be then con‐
       verted to virtually any graphics format using the tools of the netpbm package .

BUGS
       Input  characters that are invalid for groff (i.e., those with ASCII code 0, or 013 octal, or between 015 and
       037 octal, or between 0200 and 0237 octal) are rejected even in TeX mode.

       The interpretation of fillval is incompatible with the pic in 10th edition Unix, which interprets 0 as  black
