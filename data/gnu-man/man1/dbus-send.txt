NAME
       dbus-send - Send a message to a message bus

SYNOPSIS
       dbus-send [--system | --session] [--dest=NAME] [--print-reply[=literal]] [--reply-timeout=MSEC] [--type=TYPE]
       OBJECT_PATH INTERFACE.MEMBER [CONTENTS ...]


DESCRIPTION
       The dbus-send command is used to send a message to a D-Bus message bus. See  http://www.freedesktop.org/soft‐
       ware/dbus/ for more information about the big picture.


       There  are  two  well-known message buses: the systemwide message bus (installed on many systems as the "mes‐
       sagebus" service) and the per-user-login-session message bus (started each time a user logs in).  The  --sys‐
       tem  and --session options direct dbus-send to send messages to the system or session buses respectively.  If
       neither is specified, dbus-send sends to the session bus.


       Nearly all uses of dbus-send must provide the --dest argument which is the name of a connection on the bus to
       send the message to. If --dest is omitted, no destination is set.


       The  object  path  and the name of the message to send must always be specified. Following arguments, if any,
       are the message contents (message arguments).  These are given as type-specified values and may include  con‐
       tainers (arrays, dicts, and variants) as described below.

       <contents>   ::= <item> | <container> [ <item> | <container>...]
       <item>       ::= <type>:<value>
       <container>  ::= <array> | <dict> | <variant>
       <array>      ::= array:<type>:<value>[,<value>...]
       <dict>       ::= dict:<type>:<type>:<key>,<value>[,<key>,<value>...]
       <variant>    ::= variant:<type>:<value>
       <type>       ::= string | int16 | uint 16 | int32 | uint32 | int64 | uint64 | double | byte | boolean | objpath

       D-Bus  supports  more  types  than  these, but dbus-send currently does not.  Also, dbus-send does not permit
       empty containers or nested containers (e.g. arrays of variants).


       Here is an example invocation:

         dbus-send --dest=org.freedesktop.ExampleName               \
                   /org/freedesktop/sample/object/name              \
                   org.freedesktop.ExampleInterface.ExampleMethod   \
                   int32:47 string:'hello world' double:65.32       \
                   array:string:"1st item","next item","last item"  \
                   dict:string:int32:"one",1,"two",2,"three",3      \
                   variant:int32:-8                                 \
                   objpath:/org/freedesktop/sample/object/name


       Note that the interface is separated from a method or signal name by a dot, though in the actual protocol the
       interface and the interface member are separate fields.


OPTIONS
       The following options are supported:

       --dest=NAME
              Specify the name of the connection to receive the message.

       --print-reply
              Block for a reply to the message sent, and print any reply received in a human-readable form.

       --print-reply=literal
              Block for a reply to the message sent, and print the body of the reply. If the reply is an object path
              or a string, it is printed literally, with no punctuation, escape characters etc.

       --reply-timeout=MSEC
              Wait for a reply for up to MSEC milliseconds.  The default  is  implementation‐defined,  typically  25
              seconds.

       --system
              Send to the system message bus.

       --session
              Send to the session message bus.  (This is the default.)

       --type=TYPE
              Specify method_call or signal (defaults to "signal").
