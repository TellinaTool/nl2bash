NAME
       ppmtv - make a portable pixmap look like taken from an American TV

SYNOPSIS
       ppmtv dimfactor [ppmfile]

DESCRIPTION
       Reads  a  portable pixmap as input. Dims every other row of image data down by the specified dim factor. This
       factor may be in the range of 0.0 (the alternate lines are totally black) to 1.0 (original image).

       This creates an effect similar to what I've once seen in the video clip 'You could be mine' by  Guns'n'Roses.
       In the scene I'm talking about you can see John Connor on his motorbike, looking up from the water trench (?)
       he's standing in. While the camera pulls back, the image gets 'normal' by brightening up the  alternate  rows
       of  it.  I thought this would be an interesting effect to try in MPEG. I did not yet check this out, however.
       Try for yourself.
