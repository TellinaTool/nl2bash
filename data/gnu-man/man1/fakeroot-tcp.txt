NAME
       fakeroot - run a command in an environment faking root privileges for file manipulation

SYNOPSIS
       fakeroot  [-l|--lib  library]  [--faked  faked-binary]  [-i load-file] [-s save-file] [-u|--unknown-is-real ]
       [-b|--fd-base ] [-h|--help ] [-v|--version ] [--] [command]

DESCRIPTION
       fakeroot runs a command in an environment wherein it appears to have root privileges for  file  manipulation.
       This  is  useful for allowing users to create archives (tar, ar, .deb etc.) with files in them with root per‐
       missions/ownership.  Without fakeroot one would need to have root privileges to create the constituent  files
       of  the archives with the correct permissions and ownership, and then pack them up, or one would have to con‐
       struct the archives directly, without using the archiver.

       fakeroot works by replacing the file manipulation library functions (chmod(2), stat(2)  etc.)  by  ones  that
       simulate  the  effect the real library functions would have had, had the user really been root. These wrapper
       functions are in a shared library /usr/lib/libfakeroot.so* which is loaded through the  LD_PRELOAD  mechanism
       of the dynamic loader. (See ld.so(8))

       If  you  intend  to  build  packages  with  fakeroot,  please  try  building  the fakeroot package first: the
       "debian/rules build" stage has a few tests (testing mostly for bugs in old fakeroot versions). If those tests
       fail  (for  example  because  you  have certain libc5 programs on your system), other packages you build with
       fakeroot will quite likely fail too, but possibly in much more subtle ways.

       Also, note that it's best not to do the building of the binaries themselves under fakeroot.  Especially  con‐
       figure  and  friends  don't  like it when the system suddenly behaves differently from what they expect. (or,
       they randomly unset some environment variables, some of which fakeroot needs).


OPTIONS
       -l library, --lib library
              Specify an alternative wrapper library.

       --faked binary
              Specify an alternative binary to use as faked.

       [--] command
              Any command you want to be ran as fakeroot. Use ‘--’ if in the command you have other options that may
              confuse fakeroot's option parsing.

       -s save-file
              Save  the  fakeroot environment to save-file on exit. This file can be used to restore the environment
              later using -i. However, this file will leak and fakeroot will behave in odd ways unless you leave the
              files  touched  inside the fakeroot alone when outside the environment. Still, this can be useful. For
              example, it can be used with rsync(1) to back up and restore whole directory trees complete with user,
              group and device information without needing to be root. See /usr/share/doc/fakeroot/README.saving for
              more details.

       -i load-file
              Load a fakeroot environment previously saved using -s from load-file.  Note that this does not implic‐
              itly  save  the  file,  use -s as well for that behaviour. Using the same file for both -i and -s in a
              single fakeroot invocation is safe.

       -u, --unknown-is-real
              Use the real ownership of files previously unknown to fakeroot instead of pretending they are owned by
              root:root.

       -b fd  Specify  fd base (TCP mode only). fd is the minimum file descriptor number to use for TCP connections;
              this may be important to avoid conflicts with the file descriptors used  by  the  programs  being  run
              under fakeroot.

       -v     Display version.


EXAMPLES
       Here  is  an  example  session with fakeroot.  Notice that inside the fake root environment file manipulation
       that requires root privileges succeeds, but is not really happening.

       $  whoami
       joost
       $ fakeroot /bin/bash
       #  whoami
       root
       # mknod hda3 b 3 1
       # ls -ld hda3
       brw-r--r--   1 root     root       3,   1 Jul  2 22:58 hda3
       # chown joost:root hda3
       # ls -ld hda3
       brw-r--r--   1 joost    root       3,   1 Jul  2 22:58 hda3
       # ls -ld /
       drwxr-xr-x  20 root     root         1024 Jun 17 21:50 /
       # chown joost:users /
       # chmod a+w /
       # ls -ld /
       drwxrwxrwx  20 joost    users        1024 Jun 17 21:50 /
       # exit
       $ ls -ld /
       drwxr-xr-x  20 root     root         1024 Jun 17 21:50 //
       $ ls -ld hda3
       -rw-r--r--   1 joost    users           0 Jul  2 22:58 hda3

       Only the effects that user joost could do anyway happen for real.

       fakeroot was specifically written to enable users to create Debian GNU/Linux packages (in the deb(5)  format)
       without  giving  them  root  privileges.   This  can be done by commands like dpkg-buildpackage -rfakeroot or
       debuild -rfakeroot (actually, -rfakeroot is default in debuild nowadays, so you don't need that argument).

SECURITY ASPECTS
       fakeroot is a regular, non-setuid program. It does not enhance a user's privileges, or decrease the  system's
       security.

FILES
       /usr/lib/libfakeroot/libfakeroot.so* The shared library containing the wrapper functions.

ENVIRONMENT
       FAKEROOTKEY
              The  key  used  to communicate with the fakeroot daemon. Any program started with the right LD_PRELOAD
              and a FAKEROOTKEY of a running daemon will automatically connect to that daemon,  and  have  the  same
              "fake"  view of the file system's permissions/ownerships.  (assuming the daemon and connecting program
              were started by the same user).

       LD_LIBRARY_PATH

       LD_PRELOAD
              Fakeroot  is  implemented   by   wrapping   system   calls.    This   is   accomplished   by   setting
              LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/usr/lib/fakeroot  and LD_PRELOAD=libfakeroot.so.0.  That library is loaded before the
              system's C library, and so most of the library functions are intercepted by it.  If you  need  to  set
              either  LD_LIBRARY_PATH or LD_PRELOAD from within a fakeroot environment, it should be set relative to
              the given paths, as in LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$LD_LIBRARY_PATH:/foo/bar/


LIMITATIONS
       Library versions
              Every command executed within fakeroot needs to be linked to the same version  of  the  C  library  as
              fakeroot itself.

       open()/create()
              fakeroot doesn't wrap open(), create(), etc. So, if user joost does either

              touch foo
              fakeroot
              ls -al foo

              or the other way around,

              fakeroot
              touch foo
              ls -al foo

              fakeroot  has  no way of knowing that in the first case, the owner of foo really should be joost while
              the second case it should have been  root.   For  the  Debian  packaging,  defaulting  to  giving  all
              "unknown"  files uid=gid=0, is always OK. The real way around this is to wrap open() and create(), but
              that creates other problems, as demonstrated by the libtricks package. This package wrapped many  more
              functions,  and  tried  to  do  a lot more than fakeroot .  It turned out that a minor upgrade of libc
              (from one where the stat() function didn't use open() to one with a stat() function that did (in  some
              cases)  use open()), would cause unexplainable segfaults (that is, the libc6 stat() called the wrapped
              open(), which would then call the libc6 stat(), etc).  Fixing them wasn't  all  that  easy,  but  once
              fixed,  it  was just a matter of time before another function started to use open(), never mind trying
              to port it to a different operating system. Thus I decided to keep the number of functions wrapped  by
              fakeroot as small as possible, to limit the likelihood of ‘collisions’.

       GNU configure (and other such programs)
              fakeroot,  in  effect, is changing the way the system behaves. Programs that probe the system like GNU
              configure may get confused by this (or if they don't, they may stress fakeroot so much  that  fakeroot
              itself becomes confused). So, it's advisable not to run "configure" from within fakeroot. As configure
              should be called in the "debian/rules build" target, running "dpkg-buildpackage -rfakeroot"  correctly
              takes care of this.

BUGS
       It  doesn't  wrap open(). This isn't bad by itself, but if a program does open("file", O_WRONLY, 000), writes
       to file "file", closes it, and then again tries to open to read the file, then that open fails, as  the  mode
       of  the file will be 000. The bug is that if root does the same, open() will succeed, as the file permissions
       aren't checked at all for root. I choose not to wrap open(), as open() is used by  many  other  functions  in
       libc (also those that are already wrapped), thus creating loops (or possible future loops, when the implemen‐
       tation of various libc functions slightly change).
