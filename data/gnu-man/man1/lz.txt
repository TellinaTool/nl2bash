NAME
       lz - gunzips and shows a listing of a gzip'd tar'd archive

SYNOPSIS
       lz file

DESCRIPTION
       lz  provides  a listing of a gzip'd tar'd archive, that is a tar(1) archive compressed with the gzip(1) util‐
       ity.  It is not strictly necessary on Debian GNU/Linux, because the GNU  tar(1)  program  provides  the  same
       capability with the command

       tar -tzf file

       but this utility is provided in the mtools package for other platforms and is retained here for completeness.
