NAME
       uniq - report or omit repeated lines

SYNOPSIS
       uniq [OPTION]... [INPUT [OUTPUT]]

DESCRIPTION
       Filter adjacent matching lines from INPUT (or standard input), writing to OUTPUT (or standard output).

       With no options, matching lines are merged to the first occurrence.

       Mandatory arguments to long options are mandatory for short options too.

       -c, --count
              prefix lines by the number of occurrences

       -d, --repeated
              only print duplicate lines

       -D, --all-repeated[=delimit-method]
              print  all  duplicate  lines  delimit-method={none(default),prepend,separate}  Delimiting is done with
              blank lines

       -f, --skip-fields=N
              avoid comparing the first N fields

       -i, --ignore-case
              ignore differences in case when comparing

       -s, --skip-chars=N
              avoid comparing the first N characters

       -u, --unique
              only print unique lines

       -z, --zero-terminated
              end lines with 0 byte, not newline

       -w, --check-chars=N
              compare no more than N characters in lines

       --help display this help and exit

       --version
              output version information and exit

       A field is a run of blanks (usually spaces and/or TABs),  then  non-blank  characters.   Fields  are  skipped
       before chars.

       Note:  'uniq' does not detect repeated lines unless they are adjacent.  You may want to sort the input first,
       or use 'sort -u' without 'uniq'.  Also, comparisons honor the rules specified by 'LC_COLLATE'.
