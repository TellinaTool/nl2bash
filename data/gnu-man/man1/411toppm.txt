DESCRIPTION

       The  originator  of this program and decipherer of the .411 format, Steve Allen <sla@alumni.caltech.edu>, has
       this to say about the utility of this program: "There's so little image in a 64x48 thumbnail (especially when
       you have the full size JPG file) that the only point in doing this was to answer the implicit challenge posed
       by the manual stating that only the camera can use these files."

       -height
