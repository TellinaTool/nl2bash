NAME
       psidtopgm - convert PostScript "image" data into a portable graymap

SYNOPSIS
       psidtopgm width height bits/sample [imagedata]

DESCRIPTION
       Reads the "image" data from a PostScript file as input.  Produces a portable graymap as output.

       This program is obsoleted by pstopnm.  What follows was written before pstopnm existed.

       This is a very simple and limited program, and is here only because so many people have asked for it.  To use
       it you have to manually extract the readhexstring data portion from your PostScript file, and then  give  the
       width,  height,  and  bits/sample on the command line.  Before you attempt this, you should at least read the
       description of the "image" operator in the PostScript Language Reference Manual.

       It would probably not be too hard to write a script that uses this filter to read a specific variety of Post‐
       Script  image,  but the variation is too great to make a general-purpose reader.  Unless, of course, you want
       to write a full-fledged PostScript interpreter...
