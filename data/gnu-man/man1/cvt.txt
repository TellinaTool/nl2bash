NAME
       cvt - calculate VESA CVT mode lines

SYNOPSIS
       cvt [-v|--verbose] [-r|--reduced] h-resolution v-resolution [refresh]

DESCRIPTION
       Cvt  is a utility for calculating VESA Coordinated Video Timing modes.  Given the desired horizontal and ver‐
       tical resolutions, a modeline adhering to the CVT standard is printed. This modeline can be included in  Xorg
       xorg.conf(5)


OPTIONS
       refresh Provide  a  vertical refresh rate in Hz.  The CVT standard prefers either 50.0, 60.0, 75.0 or 85.0Hz.
               The default is 60.0Hz.

       -v|--verbose
               Warn verbosely when a given mode does not completely correspond with CVT standards.

       -r|--reduced
               Create a mode with reduced blanking.  This allows for higher frequency signals, with a lower or equal
               dotclock. Not for Cathode Ray Tube based displays though.
