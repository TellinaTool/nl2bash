NAME
       cancel - cancel jobs

SYNOPSIS
       cancel  [  -E ] [ -U username ] [ -a ] [ -h hostname[:port] ] [ -u username ] [ -x ] [ id ] [ destination ] [
       destination-id ]

DESCRIPTION
       cancel cancels existing print jobs. The -a option will remove all jobs from the specified destination.

OPTIONS
       The following options are recognized by cancel:

       -E
            Forces encryption when connecting to the server.

       -U username
            Specifies the username to use when connecting to the server.

       -a
            Cancel all jobs on the named destination, or all jobs on all destinations if none is provided.

       -h hostname[:port]
            Chooses an alternate server.

       -u username
            Cancels jobs owned by username.

       -x
            Deletes job data files in addition to canceling.

COMPATIBILITY
       Unlike the System V printing system, CUPS allows printer names to  contain  any  printable  character  except
       SPACE, TAB, "/", or "#".  Also, printer and class names are not case-sensitive.

NOTES
       Administrators  wishing to prevent unauthorized cancellation of jobs via the -u option should require authen‐
       tication for Cancel-Jobs operations in cupsd.conf(5).
