NAME
       hcitool - configure Bluetooth connections

SYNOPSIS
       hcitool [-h]
       hcitool [-i <hciX>] [command [command parameters]]


DESCRIPTION
       hcitool  is used to configure Bluetooth connections and send some special command to Bluetooth devices. If no
       command is given, or if the option -h is used, hcitool prints some usage information and exits.

OPTIONS
       -h     Gives a list of possible commands

       -i <hciX>
              The command is applied to device hciX , which must be the name of an installed  Bluetooth  device.  If
              not specified, the command will be sent to the first available Bluetooth device.

COMMANDS
       dev    Display local devices

       inq    Inquire  remote  devices. For each discovered device, Bluetooth device address, clock offset and class
              are printed.

       scan   Inquire remote devices. For each discovered device, device name are printed.

       name <bdaddr>
              Print device name of remote device with Bluetooth address bdaddr.

       info <bdaddr>
              Print device name, version and supported features of remote device with Bluetooth address bdaddr.

       spinq  Start periodic inquiry process. No inquiry results are printed.

       epinq  Exit periodic inquiry process.

       cmd <ogf> <ocf> [parameters]
              Submit an arbitrary HCI command to local device.  ogf, ocf and parameters are hexadecimal bytes.

       con    Display active baseband connections

       cc [--role=m|s] [--pkt-type=<ptype>] <bdaddr>
              Create baseband connection to remote device with Bluetooth address bdaddr.  Option  --pkt-type  speci‐
              fies  a  list  of  allowed packet types.  <ptype> is a comma-separated list of packet types, where the
              possible packet types are DM1, DM3, DM5, DH1, DH3, DH5, HV1, HV2, HV3.  Default is to allow all packet
              types. Option --role can have value m (do not allow role switch, stay master) or s (allow role switch,
              become slave if the peer asks to become master). Default is m.

       dc <bdaddr> [reason]
              Delete baseband connection from remote device with Bluetooth address bdaddr.  The reason can be one of
              the  Bluetooth  HCI  error codes. Default is 19 for user ended connections. The value must be given in
              decimal.

       sr <bdaddr> <role>
              Switch role for the baseband connection from the remote device to master or slave.

       cpt <bdaddr> <packet types>
              Change packet types for baseband connection to device with Bluetooth address bdaddr.  packet types  is
              a  comma-separated  list of packet types, where the possible packet types are DM1, DM3, DM5, DH1, DH3,
              DH5, HV1, HV2, HV3.

       rssi <bdaddr>
              Display received signal strength information for the connection to the device with  Bluetooth  address
              bdaddr.

       lq <bdaddr>
              Display link quality for the connection to the device with Bluetooth address bdaddr.

       tpl <bdaddr> [type]
              Display transmit power level for the connection to the device with Bluetooth address bdaddr.  The type
              can be 0 for the current transmit power level (which is default) or 1 for the maximum  transmit  power
              level.

       afh <bdaddr>
              Display AFH channel map for the connection to the device with Bluetooth address bdaddr.

       lp <bdaddr> [value]
              With  no  value, displays link policy settings for the connection to the device with Bluetooth address
              bdaddr.  If value is given, sets the link policy settings for that connection to value.  Possible val‐
              ues are RSWITCH, HOLD, SNIFF and PARK.

       lst <bdaddr> [value]
              With  no  value,  displays  link  supervision  timeout for the connection to the device with Bluetooth
              address bdaddr.  If value is given, sets the link supervision timeout for  that  connection  to  value
              slots, or to infinite if value is 0.

       auth <bdaddr>
              Request authentication for the device with Bluetooth address bdaddr.

       enc <bdaddr> [encrypt enable]
              Enable or disable the encryption for the device with Bluetooth address bdaddr.

       key <bdaddr>
              Change the connection link key for the device with Bluetooth address bdaddr.

       clkoff <bdaddr>
              Read the clock offset for the device with Bluetooth address bdaddr.

       clock [bdaddr] [which clock]
              Read  the  clock for the device with Bluetooth address bdaddr.  The clock can be 0 for the local clock
