NAME
       brltty - refreshable braille display driver for Linux/Unix

SYNOPSIS
       brltty [option ...]

DESCRIPTION
       brltty is a background process (daemon) which provides access to the console screen (when in text mode) for a
       blind person using a refreshable braille display.  It drives  the  braille  display,  and  provides  complete
       screen review functionality.  Some speech capability has also been incorporated.

OPTIONS
       Options can be passed to brltty in a number of ways.  From most to least influential, these are:

       1.  Command Line Options

       2.  Boot Parameters

       3.  Environment Variables (if the -E (--environment-variables) option is in effect)

       4.  The Configuration File

       5.  Built-in Defaults

   Command Line Options
       The  options  are processed sequentially from left to right.  If an option is specified more than once, or in
       case of a conflict, the rightmost specification takes precedence.

       The following options are supported:

       -a table (--attributes-table=)
              The path to the attributes table.  Relative paths are anchored at /etc/brltty.  The .atb extension  is
              optional.  The built-in default is left_right.atb.

       -b driver,...|auto (--braille-driver=)
              The driver for the braille display (see Driver Specification).  The built-in default is auto.

       -c table (--contraction-table=)
              The path to the contraction table.  Relative paths are anchored at /etc/brltty.  The .ctb extension is
              optional.

       -d device,... (--braille-device=)
              The device to which the braille display is connected.  The built-in default is usb:.

              The general form of a braille device specification is qualifier:data.  For backward compatibility with
              earlier releases, if the qualifier is omitted then serial: is assumed.  The following device types are
              supported:

              Bluetooth
                     For a bluetooth device, specify bluez:address.  The address must be six  two-digit  hexadecimal
                     numbers separated by colons, e.g.  01:23:45:67:89:AB.

              Serial For  a  serial  device, specify serial:/path/to/device.  The serial: qualifier is optional (for
                     backward compatibility).  If a relative path is given then it's anchored at  /dev/  (the  usual
                     location where devices are defined on a Unix-like system).  The following device specifications
                     all refer to the primary serial device: serial:/dev/ttyS0, serial:ttyS0, /dev/ttyS0, ttyS0.

              USB    For a USB device, specify usb:.  brltty will search for the first USB device which matches  the
                     braille  display  driver being used.  If this is inadequate, e.g. if you have more than one USB
                     braille display which requires the same driver, then you can refine the device specification by
                     appending  the  serial number of the display to it, e.g.  usb:12345.  N.B.: The "identification
                     by serial number" feature doesn't work for some models because some manufacturers either  don't
                     set the USB serial number descriptor at all or do set it but not to a unique value.

              A  comma-delimited  list  of  braille devices may be specified.  If this is done then autodetection is
              performed on each listed device in sequence.  This feature  is  particularly  useful  if  you  have  a
              braille display with more than one interface, e.g. both a serial and a USB port.

       -e (--standard-error)
              Write logs to standard error rather than to the system log (useful for debugging).

       -f file (--configuration-file=)
              The  path  to  the  configuration file.  Relative paths are anchored at the current working directory.
              The built-in default is /etc/brltty.conf.

       -h (--help)
              Print a command line usage summary (commonly used options only), and then exit.

       -i name (--speech-input=)
              The file system object (FIFO, named pipe, named socket, etc) which gives other applications access  to
              brltty's  speech driver for text-to-speech conversion.  It's created at start-up and removed at termi‐
              nation.  Relative paths are anchored at the current working directory.  The built-in default  is  that
              the file system object is not created.

       -k table (--key-table=)
              The  path  to the keyboard key table.  Relative paths are anchored at /etc/brltty.  The .ktb extension
              and the kbd- prefix are optional.

       -l level (--log-level=)
              The minimum severity level for messages written to the log.  Any of  the  following  numbers,  or  any
              abbreviation of their corresponding names, may be specified:

              0   emergency

              1   alert

              2   critical

              3   error

              4   warning

              5   notice

              6   information

              7   debug

       The built-in default is notice.

       -m device (--midi-device=)
              The device to use for the Musical Instrument Digital Interface.  For ALSA it's client:port, where each
              may be either a number or a case-sensitive substring of its name.  For other interfaces it's the  full
              path to an appropriate system device.  The built-in default is:

              Linux/ALSA  the first available MIDI output port

              Linux/OSS   /dev/sequencer

       -n (--no-daemon)
              Remain in the foreground (useful for debugging).

       -p device (--pcm-device=)
              The  device  to  use for digital audio.  For ALSA it's name[:argument,...].  For other interfaces it's
              the full path to an appropriate system device.  The built-in default is:

              FreeBSD     /dev/dsp

              Linux/ALSA  hw:0,0

              Linux/OSS   /dev/dsp

              Solaris     /dev/audio

       -q (--quiet)
              Suppress the start-up messages.  This  is  done  by  reducing  the  default  log  level  (see  the  -l
              (--log-level=) option) to warning (information if either -v (--verify) or -V (--version) is also spec‐
              ified).

       -r (--release-device)
              Release the device to which the braille display is connected when the current screen or  window  can't
              be read.

       -s driver,...|auto (--speech-driver=)
              The driver for the speech synthesizer (see Driver Specification).  The built-in default is auto.

       -t table (--text-table=)
              The  path  to  the  text  table.   Relative  paths are anchored at /etc/brltty.  The .ttb extension is
              optional.  The built-in default is en-nabcc.ttb (the North American Braille Computer Code).

       -v (--verify)
              Print the start-up messages and then exit.  This always includes the versions of  brltty  itself,  the
              server  side  of  its  application  programming interface, and each of the selected braille and speech
              drivers.  If the -q (--quiet) option isn't also specified then it also  includes  the  values  of  the
              options  after all sources have been considered.  If more than one braille driver and/or more than one
              braille device has been specified then braille display autodetection is performed.  If more  than  one
              speech driver has been specified then speech synthesizer autodetection is performed.

       -x driver (--screen-driver=)
              The screen driver.  The built-in default is operating system appropriate.

       -A name=value,... (--api-parameters=)
              Parameters  for  the  application programming interface.  If the same parameter is specified more than
              once then the rightmost specification is used.  Parameter names may be abbreviated.

       -B [driver:]name=value,... (--braille-parameters=)
              Parameters for the braille display driver.  If the same parameter is specified more than once then the
              rightmost  specification  is  used.  Parameter names may be abbreviated.  If a parameter assignment is
              qualified with a driver identification code then it's only processed if that braille display driver is
              being used.

       -D directory (--drivers-directory=)
              The  path  to  the  directory  which  contains  the dynamically loadable driver objects.  The built-in
              default is /lib/brltty.

       -E (--environment-variables)
              Recognize environment variables.

       -F file (--preferences-file=)
              The path to the preferences file.  Relative paths  are  anchored  at  /var/lib/brltty.   The  built-in
              default is brltty.prefs.

       -H (--full-help)
              Print a command line usage summary (all options), and then exit.

       -I (--install-service)
              (Windows  only) Install brltty as the BrlAPI service so that it will be automatically started when the
              system is booted, and so that applications can know that a BrlAPI server is running.

       -K arg (--keyboard-properties=)
              Properties of the keyboard.

       -L file (--log-file=)
              The file to which log messages are written.  Relative paths are anchored at the current working direc‐
              tory.  The default is to send log messages to the system log.

       -M csecs (--message-delay=)
              The message hold time in hundredths of a second.  The built-in default is 400 (4 seconds).

       -N (--no-api)
              Don't start the application programming interface.

       -P file (--pid-file=)
              The  full  path to the process identifier file.  If this option is supplied, brltty writes its process
              identifier (pid) into the specified file at start-up.  The file is removed when brltty terminates.

       -R (--remove-service)
              (Windows only) Remove the BrlAPI service so that brltty will not be  automatically  started  when  the
              system is booted, and so that applications can know that no BrlAPI server is running.

       -S [driver:]name=value,... (--speech-parameters=)
              Parameters  for the speech synthesizer driver.  If the same parameter is specified more than once then
              the rightmost specification is used.  Parameter names may be abbreviated.  If a  parameter  assignment
              is  qualified  with  a  driver identification code then it's only processed if that speech synthesizer
              driver is being used.

       -T directory (--tables-directory=)
              The path to the directory which contains the text,  attributes,  contraction,  and  key  tables.   The
              built-in default is /etc/brltty.

       -V (--version)
              Print  the  versions  of  brltty itself, the server side of its application programming interface, and
              those drivers which were configured in at build-time, and then exit.  If the -q (--quiet) option isn't
              also specified then also print copyright information.

       -W directory (--writable-directory=)
              The path to a directory which can be written to.  The built-in default is /var/run/brltty.

       -X name=value,... (--screen-parameters=)
              Parameters  for  the screen driver.  If the same parameter is specified more than once then the right‐
              most specification is used.  Parameter names may be abbreviated.

              A  comma-delimited  list of drivers may be specified.  If this is done then autodetection is performed
              using each listed driver in sequence.  You may need to experiment in order to determine the most reli‐
              able order since some drivers autodetect better than others.

              If  the  single  word auto is specified then autodetection is performed using only those drivers which
              are known to be reliable for this purpose.
