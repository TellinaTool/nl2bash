SSH-ARGV0(1)                                 BSD General Commands Manual                                SSH-ARGV0(1)

NAME
     ssh-argv0 — replaces the old ssh command-name as hostname handling

SYNOPSIS
     hostname | user@hostname [-l login_name] [command]

     hostname | user@hostname [-afgknqstvxACNTX1246] [-b bind_address] [-c cipher_spec] [-e escape_char]
     [-i identity_file] [-l login_name] [-m mac_spec] [-o option] [-p port] [-F configfile] [-L port:host:hostport]
     [-R port:host:hostport] [-D port] [command]

DESCRIPTION
     ssh-argv0 replaces the old ssh command-name as hostname handling.  If you link to this script with a hostname
     then executing the link is equivalent to having executed ssh with that hostname as an argument.  All other
     arguments are passed to ssh and will be processed normally.

OPTIONS
     See ssh(1).

FILES
     See ssh(1).
