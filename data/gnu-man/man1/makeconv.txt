MAKECONV(1)                                        ICU 52.1 Manual                                       MAKECONV(1)



NAME
       makeconv - compile a converter table

SYNOPSIS
       makeconv  [  -h,  -?,  --help  ] [ -c, --copyright ] [ -v, --verbose ] [ -d, --destdir destination ] convert‐
       ertable ...

DESCRIPTION
       makeconv converts the ICU converter table convertertable into a binary file. The binary  file  has  the  same
       base  name  as convertertable but has a .cnv extension (instead of the typical .ucm extension of the convert‐
       ertable file).  This binary file can then be read directly by ICU, or used by  pkgdata(1)  for  incorporation
       into a larger archive or library.

       The  convertertable  must  be  in  the ICU ucm (Unicode Codepage Mapping) format in order to be understood by
       makeconv.  The ICU ucm format is similar to the IBM NLTC  upmap/tpmap/rpmap  files.   Comments  in  the  con‐
       vertable are handled as follows. If a comment (starting with a `#' sign) that is after some text does contain
       the fallback indicator `|' then only the text starting with the `#' sign, and ending before the `|' sign,  is
       ignored.   Otherwise, or if the comment is the first thing on the line, the comment runs up to the end of the
       line. This special handling of comments is to accomodate the practice of putting fallback information in com‐
       ments in the strict IBM NLTC ucmap format.

       Note that new converters will be automatically found by ICU after their installation in ICU's data directory.
       They do not need to be listed in the convrtrs.txt(5) converters aliases file in  order  to  be  available  to
       applications using ICU.  They do need to be listed there if one wants to give them aliases, or tags, though.

OPTIONS
       -h, -?, --help
              Print help about usage and exit.

       -c, --copyright
              Include a copyright notice in the binary data.

       -v, --verbose
              Display extra informative messages during execution.

       -d, --destdir destination
              Set  the  destination directory to destination.  The default destination directory is specified by the
              environment variable ICU_DATA.

CAVEATS
       If an existing converter table is changed and recompiled using makeconv, the resulting binary  file  must  be
       packaged  in the same way that it was packaged initially. For example, if converters were grouped together in
       an archive or a library with pkgdata(1), then the archive or library must be  rebuilt  with  the  new  binary
       file.  A standalone binary converter file will not take precedence over a packaged one.

ENVIRONMENT
       ICU_DATA  Specifies  the directory containing ICU data. Defaults to ${prefix}/share/icu/52.1/.  Some tools in
                 ICU depend on the presence of the trailing slash. It is thus important to  make  sure  that  it  is
                 present if ICU_DATA is set.
