NAME
       psfxtable - handle Unicode character tables for console fonts

SYNOPSIS
       psfxtable [-i infont] [-o outfont] [-it intable] [-ot outtable] [-nt]

DESCRIPTION
       psfxtable  handles  the  embedded  Unicode character table for .psf format console fonts. It reads a font and
       possibly a table and writes a font and/or a table.  psfaddtable(1), psfgettable(1) and  psfstriptable(1)  are
       links to it.

       Each  of  the filenames infont, outfont, intable, and outtable may be replaced by a single dash (-), in which
       case standard input or standard output is used.  If no -i option is given, the font  is  read  from  standard
       input.   If  no -it or -o or -ot option is given, no input table is read or no output font or output table is
       written.

       By default the output font (if any) will have a Unicode table when either the  input  font  has  one,  or  an
       explicit  table  (which  overrides an input font table) has been provided.  The option -nt causes output of a
       font without table.  When outfont is requested it will get a psf1 header when infont has a  psf1  header  and
       intable does not have sequences and a psf2 header otherwise.
