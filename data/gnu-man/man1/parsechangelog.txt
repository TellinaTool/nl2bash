NAME
       parsechangelog - parse Debian changelogs and output them in other formats

SYNOPSIS
       parsechangelog [options] [changelogfile]

        Options:
           --help, -h                  print usage information
           --version, -V               print version information
           --file, -l <file>           changelog file to parse, defaults
                                       to 'debian/changelog'
           -F<changelogformat>         ignored if changelogformat = 'debian'
                                       for compatibility with dpkg-dev
           -L<libdir>                  ignored for compatibility with dpkg-dev
           --format <outputformat>     see man page for list of available
                                       output formats, defaults to 'dpkg'
                                       for compatibility with dpkg-dev
           --since, -s, -v <version>   include all changes later than version
           --until, -u <version>       include all changes earlier than version
           --from, -f <version>        include all changes equal or later
                                       than version
           --to, -t <version>          include all changes up to or equal
                                       than version
           --count, -c, -n <number>    include <number> entries from the top
                                       (or the tail if <number> is lower than 0)
           --offset, -o <number>       change the starting point for --count,
                                       counted from the top (or the tail if
                                       <number> is lower than 0)
           --all                       include all changes

       If neither "changelogfile" nor "-l <file>" are specified, debian/changelog will be used. If two different
       files are specified the program will abort.

       If the filename is "-" the program reads the changelog from standard input.

       "--all" overrides all other range selecting options. "--count" overrides all other range selection options
       except for "--all".  The range selecting options can be mixed together, but only one of "--since" and
       "--from" and one of "--until" and "--to" can be specified at the same time.

       The dpkg and rfc822 formats default to showing only the first entry when no other options are given with
       while the HTML and XML formats default to showing all entries.

       For a more extensive documentation of the range selecting options and some (hopefully enlightening) examples
       see "COMMON OUTPUT OPTIONS" in Parse::DebianChangelog.

DESCRIPTION
       parsechangelog parses Debian changelogs as described in the Debian policy (version 3.6.2.1 at the time of
       this writing) and converts them to other output formats. See section "SEE ALSO" for locations where to find
       the full format definition.

       The output formats supported are currently:

       dpkg
           Format as known from dpkg-parsechangelog(1). All requested entries (see "SYNOPSIS" on how to select
           specific entries) are returned in the usual Debian control format, merged in one stanza, ready to be used
           in a .changes file.

       rfc822
           Similar to the "dpkg" format, but the requested entries are returned as one stanza each, i.e. they are
           not merged. This is probably the format to use if you want a machine-usable representation of the
           changelog.

       xml Just a simple XML dump of the changelog data. Without any schema or DTD currently, just some made up XML.
           The actual format might still change. Comments and Improvements welcome.

       html
           The changelog is converted to a somewhat nice looking HTML file with some nice features as a quick-link
           bar with direct links to every entry.  NOTE: This is not configurable yet and was specifically designed
           to be used on <http://packages.debian.org/>. This is planned to be changed until version 1.0. The used
           Parse::DebianChangelog module already supports configuration, however, this isn't exposed by this program
           yet.

SEE ALSO
       Parse::DebianChangelog, the underlying Perl module
