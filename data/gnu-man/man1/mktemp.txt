NAME
       mktemp - create a temporary file or directory

SYNOPSIS
       mktemp [OPTION]... [TEMPLATE]

DESCRIPTION
       Create  a temporary file or directory, safely, and print its name.  TEMPLATE must contain at least 3 consecu‐
       tive 'X's in last component.  If TEMPLATE is not specified, use  tmp.XXXXXXXXXX,  and  --tmpdir  is  implied.
       Files are created u+rw, and directories u+rwx, minus umask restrictions.

       -d, --directory
              create a directory, not a file

       -u, --dry-run
              do not create anything; merely print a name (unsafe)

       -q, --quiet
              suppress diagnostics about file/dir-creation failure

       --suffix=SUFF
              append  SUFF  to  TEMPLATE.  SUFF must not contain slash.  This option is implied if TEMPLATE does not
              end in X.

       --tmpdir[=DIR]
              interpret TEMPLATE relative to DIR.  If DIR is not specified, use $TMPDIR if  set,  else  /tmp.   With
              this option, TEMPLATE must not be an absolute name.  Unlike with -t, TEMPLATE may contain slashes, but
              mktemp creates only the final component

       -p DIR use DIR as a prefix; implies -t [deprecated]

       -t     interpret TEMPLATE as a single file name component, relative to a directory: $TMPDIR, if set; else the
              directory specified via -p; else /tmp [deprecated]

       --help display this help and exit

       --version
              output version information and exit
