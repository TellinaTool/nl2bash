NAME
       pax11publish - PulseAudio X11 Credential Utility

SYNOPSIS
       pax11publish -h

       pax11publish [options] [-d]

       pax11publish [options] -e

       pax11publish [options] -i

       pax11publish [options] -r

DESCRIPTION
       The  pax11publish  utility  can  be  used to dump or manipulate the PulseAudio server credentials that can be
       stored as properties on the X11 root window.

       Please note that the loadable module module-x11-publish  exports  the  same  information  directly  from  the
       PulseAudio sound server, and should in most cases be used in preference over this tool.

       Use the following command to dump the raw PulseAudio-specific data that is stored in your X11 root window:

       xprop -root | grep ^PULSE_

OPTIONS
       -h     Show help.

       -d     Read  the  PulseAudio server credentials currently set on the X11 root window and dump them in a human
              readable form. This reads the PULSE_SERVER, PULSE_SINK, PULSE_SOURCE and PULSE_COOKIE properties.

       -i     Similar to -d, however dumps them in a Bourne shell compatible format so they  may  be  used  together
              with  the  eval  shell  command to set the $PULSE_SERVER, $PULSE_SINK, $PULSE_SOURCE environment vari‐
              ables. Also  reads  the  authentication  cookie  from  the  root  window  and  stores  it  in  ~/.con‐
              fig/pulse/cookie.

       -e     Export  the  currently  locally  used sound server, sink, source configuration to the X11 root window.
              This takes the data from the $PULSE_SERVER, $PULSE_SINK, $PULSE_SOURCE environment variables and  com‐
              bines them with the data from ~/.config/pulse/client.conf (or /etc/pulse/client.conf if that file does
              not exist). If specific options are passed on the command line (-S, -O, -I, -c, see below), they  take
              precedence. Also uploads the local authentication cookie ~/.config/pulse/cookie to the X11 server.

       -r     Removes the configured PulseAudio configuration from the X11 root window.

       -D DISPLAY
              Connect to the specified X11 display, instead of the default one configured in $DISPLAY.

       -S SERVER
              Only valid for -e: export the specified PulseAudio server as default to the X11 display instead of the
              one configured via local configuration.

       -O SINK
              Only valid for -e: export the specified sink as default sink to the X11 display  instead  of  the  one
              configured via local configuration.

       -I SOURCE
              Only  valid  for -e: export the specified source as default to the X11 display instead of the one con‐
              figured via local configuration.

       -c FILE
              Only valid for -e: export the PulseAudio authentication cookie stored in the specified file to the X11
              display instead of the one stored in ~/.config/pulse/cookie.
