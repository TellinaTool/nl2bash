NAME
       dh_bash-completion - install bash completions for package

SYNOPSIS
       dh_bash-completion [debhelper options]

DESCRIPTION
       dh_bash-completion is a debhelper program that is responsible for installing completions for bash, usable
       installing the "bash-completion" package.

       If a file named debian/package.bash-completion exists, then different actions are performed, depending on its
       format.

       It can be a proper completion snippet, and in that case it would be installed in the completion directory,
       and no other actions would be performed.

       It can also be a list of files, with an optionally specified name to call the completion snippet after. The
       file format is as follows:

         my/path/to/foo-completion       # this would be installed as "foo-completion"
         my/path/to/bar-completion  baz  # this would be installed as "baz"
