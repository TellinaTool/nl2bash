WHATIS(1)                                        Manual pager utils                                        WHATIS(1)



NAME
       whatis - display one-line manual page descriptions

SYNOPSIS
       whatis [-dlv?V] [-r|-w] [-s list] [-m system[,...]] [-M path] [-L locale] [-C file] name ...

DESCRIPTION
       Each manual page has a short description available within it.  whatis searches the manual page names and dis‐
       plays the manual page descriptions of any name matched.

       name may contain wildcards (-w) or be a regular expression (-r).  Using these options, it may be necessary to
       quote the name or escape (\) the special characters to stop the shell from interpreting them.

       index  databases are used during the search, and are updated by the mandb program.  Depending on your instal‐
       lation, this may be run by a periodic cron job, or may need to be run manually after new  manual  pages  have
       been  installed.   To  produce  an old style text whatis database from the relative index database, issue the
       command:

       whatis -M manpath -w '*' | sort > manpath/whatis

       where manpath is a manual page hierarchy such as /usr/man.

OPTIONS
       -d, --debug
              Print debugging information.

       -v, --verbose
              Print verbose warning messages.

       -r, --regex
              Interpret each name as a regular expression.  If a name matches any part of a page name, a match  will
              be made.  This option causes whatis to be somewhat slower due to the nature of database searches.

       -w, --wildcard
              Interpret  each  name  as  a  pattern  containing  shell  style wildcards.  For a match to be made, an
              expanded name must match the entire page name.  This option causes whatis to be somewhat slower due to
              the nature of database searches.

       -l, --long
              Do not trim output to the terminal width.  Normally, output will be truncated to the terminal width to
              avoid ugly results from poorly-written NAME sections.

       -s list, --sections list, --section list
              Search only the given manual sections.  list is a colon- or comma-separated list of sections.   If  an
              entry  in  list  is  a  simple  section, for example "3", then the displayed list of descriptions will
              include pages in sections "3", "3perl", "3x", and so on; while if an entry in list has  an  extension,
              for example "3perl", then the list will only include pages in that exact part of the manual section.

       -m system[,...], --systems=system[,...]
              If  this  system  has access to other operating system's manual page names, they can be accessed using
              this option.  To search NewOS's manual page names, use the option -m NewOS.

              The system specified can be a combination of comma delimited operating system  names.   To  include  a
              search of the native operating system's manual page names, include the system name man in the argument
              string.  This option will override the $SYSTEM environment variable.

       -M path, --manpath=path
              Specify an alternate set of colon-delimited manual page hierarchies to  search.   By  default,  whatis
              uses  the  $MANPATH environment variable, unless it is empty or unset, in which case it will determine
              an appropriate manpath based on your $PATH environment variable.  This option overrides  the  contents
              of $MANPATH.

       -L locale, --locale=locale
              whatis  will  normally  determine  your  current locale by a call to the C function setlocale(3) which
              interrogates various environment variables, possibly including $LC_MESSAGES and $LANG.  To temporarily
              override  the  determined  value,  use this option to supply a locale string directly to whatis.  Note
              that it will not take effect until the search for pages actually begins.  Output such as the help mes‐
              sage will always be displayed in the initially determined locale.

       -C file, --config-file=file
              Use this user configuration file rather than the default of ~/.manpath.

       -?, --help
              Print a help message and exit.

       --usage
              Print a short usage message and exit.

       -V, --version
              Display version information.

EXIT STATUS
       0      Successful program execution.

       1      Usage, syntax or configuration file error.

       2      Operational error.

       16     Nothing was found that matched the criteria specified.

ENVIRONMENT
       SYSTEM If  $SYSTEM is set, it will have the same effect as if it had been specified as the argument to the -m
              option.

       MANPATH
              If $MANPATH is set, its value is interpreted as the colon-delimited manual page hierarchy search  path
              to use.

       MANWIDTH
              If  $MANWIDTH  is  set, its value is used as the terminal width (see the --long option).  If it is not
              set, the terminal width will be calculated using an ioctl(2) if available, the value of  $COLUMNS,  or
              falling back to 80 characters if all else fails.

FILES
       /usr/share/man/index.(bt|db|dir|pag)
              A traditional global index database cache.

       /var/cache/man/index.(bt|db|dir|pag)
              An FHS compliant global index database cache.

       /usr/share/man/.../whatis
              A traditional whatis text database.
