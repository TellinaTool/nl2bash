NAME
       ppmtorgb3 - separate a portable pixmap into three portable graymaps

SYNOPSIS
       ppmtorgb3 [ppmfile]

DESCRIPTION
       Reads  a  portable  pixmap  as input.  Writes three portable graymaps as output, one each for red, green, and
       blue.

       The output filenames are constructed by taking the input filename, stripping off any extension, and appending
       ".red",  ".grn",  and  ".blu".   For  example, separating lenna.ppm would result in lenna.red, lenna.grn, and
       lenna.blu.  If the input comes from stdin, the names are noname.red, noname.grn, and noname.blu.
