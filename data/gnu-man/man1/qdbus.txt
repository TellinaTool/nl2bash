NAME
       qdbus - a communication-interface for qt-based applications


SYNOPSIS
       qdbus [--system] [--literal] [servicename] [path] [method] [args]



DESCRIPTION
       qdbus  provides  an  interface  to  Qt-based applications communicating over D-Bus.  See http://www.freedesk‐
       top.org/software/dbus/ for more information about the big picture.

       By default qdbus will list all service names of services that are running  and  you  can  manipulate  at  the
       moment.  You can also manipulate and run several types of methods for each dbus-enabled application.


       servicename
              the service to connect to (e.g., org.freedesktop.DBus)

       path   the path to the object (e.g., /)

       method the method to call, with or without the interface

       args   arguments to pass to the call



OPTIONS
       --system
              connect to the system bus

       --literal
              print replies literally


EXAMPLE
       Here is an example of using qdbus to list all status information about a service:
       % qdbus org.ktorrent.ktorrent
