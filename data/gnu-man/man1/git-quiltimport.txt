NAME
       git-quiltimport - Applies a quilt patchset onto the current branch

SYNOPSIS
       git quiltimport [--dry-run | -n] [--author <author>] [--patches <dir>]


DESCRIPTION
       Applies a quilt patchset onto the current Git branch, preserving the patch boundaries, patch order, and patch
       descriptions present in the quilt patchset.

       For each patch the code attempts to extract the author from the patch description. If that fails it falls
       back to the author specified with --author. If the --author flag was not given the patch description is
       displayed and the user is asked to interactively enter the author of the patch.

       If a subject is not found in the patch description the patch name is preserved as the 1 line subject in the
       Git description.

OPTIONS
       -n, --dry-run
           Walk through the patches in the series and warn if we cannot find all of the necessary information to
           commit a patch. At the time of this writing only missing author information is warned about.

       --author Author Name <Author Email>
           The author name and email address to use when no author information can be found in the patch
           description.

       --patches <dir>
           The directory to find the quilt patches and the quilt series file.

           The default for the patch directory is patches or the value of the $QUILT_PATCHES environment variable.
