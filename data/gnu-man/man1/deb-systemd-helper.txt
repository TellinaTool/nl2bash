NAME
       deb-systemd-helper - subset of systemctl for machines not running systemd

SYNOPSIS
       deb-systemd-helper enable|disable|mask|unmask|is-enabled|was-enabled|debian-installed|update-state|reenable
       unit file ...

DESCRIPTION
       deb-systemd-helper is a Debian-specific helper script which re-implements the enable, disable, is-enabled and
       reenable commands from systemctl.

       The "enable" action will only be performed once (when first installing the package). On the first "enable",
       an state file is created which will be deleted upon "disable", but only when _DEB_SYSTEMD_HELPER_PURGE=1 to
       distinguish purge from remove.

       The "mask" action will keep state on whether the service was enabled/disabled before and will properly return
       to that state on "unmask".

       The "was-enabled" action is not present in systemctl, but is required in Debian so that we can figure out
       whether a service was enabled before we installed an updated service file. See http://bugs.debian.org/717603
       for details.

       The "debian-installed" action is also not present in systemctl. It returns 0 if the state file of at least
       one of the given units is present.

       The "update-state" action is also not present in systemctl. It updates deb-systemd-helper's state file,
       removing obsolete entries (e.g. service files that are no longer shipped by the package) and adding new
       entries (e.g.  new service files shipped by the package) without enabling them.

       deb-systemd-helper is intended to be used from maintscripts to enable systemd unit files. It is specifically
       NOT intended to be used interactively by users. Instead, users should run systemd and use systemctl, or not
       bother about the systemd enabled state in case they are not running systemd.

ENVIRONMENT
       _DEB_SYSTEMD_HELPER_DEBUG
           If you export _DEB_SYSTEMD_HELPER_DEBUG=1, deb-systemd-helper will print debug messages to stderr (thus
           visible in dpkg runs). Please include these when filing a bugreport.
