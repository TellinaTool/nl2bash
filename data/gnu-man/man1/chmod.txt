NAME
       chmod - change file mode bits

SYNOPSIS
       chmod [OPTION]... MODE[,MODE]... FILE...
       chmod [OPTION]... OCTAL-MODE FILE...
       chmod [OPTION]... --reference=RFILE FILE...

DESCRIPTION
       This  manual  page  documents  the GNU version of chmod.  chmod changes the file mode bits of each given file
       according to mode, which can be either a symbolic representation of changes to make, or an octal number  rep‐
       resenting the bit pattern for the new mode bits.

       The  format  of  a symbolic mode is [ugoa...][[+-=][perms...]...], where perms is either zero or more letters
       from the set rwxXst, or a single letter from the set ugo.  Multiple symbolic modes can be given, separated by
       commas.

       A combination of the letters ugoa controls which users' access to the file will be changed: the user who owns
       it (u), other users in the file's group (g), other users not in the file's group (o), or all users  (a).   If
       none  of  these  are  given,  the  effect  is  as if a were given, but bits that are set in the umask are not
       affected.

       The operator + causes the selected file mode bits to be added to the existing file mode bits of each file;  -
       causes  them  to  be  removed; and = causes them to be added and causes unmentioned bits to be removed except
       that a directory's unmentioned set user and group ID bits are not affected.

       The letters rwxXst select file mode bits for the affected users: read (r), write (w), execute (or search  for
       directories)  (x),  execute/search only if the file is a directory or already has execute permission for some
       user (X), set user or group ID on execution (s), restricted deletion flag or sticky bit (t).  Instead of  one
       or more of these letters, you can specify exactly one of the letters ugo: the permissions granted to the user
       who owns the file (u), the permissions granted to other users who are members of the file's  group  (g),  and
       the permissions granted to users that are in neither of the two preceding categories (o).

       A numeric mode is from one to four octal digits (0-7), derived by adding up the bits with values 4, 2, and 1.
       Omitted digits are assumed to be leading zeros.  The first digit selects the set user ID (4) and set group ID
       (2)  and restricted deletion or sticky (1) attributes.  The second digit selects permissions for the user who
       owns the file: read (4), write (2), and execute (1); the third selects permissions for  other  users  in  the
       file's  group,  with  the  same values; and the fourth for other users not in the file's group, with the same
       values.

       chmod never changes the permissions of symbolic links; the chmod system call cannot change their permissions.
       This  is  not  a  problem since the permissions of symbolic links are never used.  However, for each symbolic
       link listed on the command line, chmod changes the permissions of the pointed-to file.   In  contrast,  chmod
       ignores symbolic links encountered during recursive directory traversals.

SETUID AND SETGID BITS
       chmod  clears  the set-group-ID bit of a regular file if the file's group ID does not match the user's effec‐
       tive group ID or one of the user's supplementary group IDs,  unless  the  user  has  appropriate  privileges.
       Additional restrictions may cause the set-user-ID and set-group-ID bits of MODE or RFILE to be ignored.  This
       behavior depends on the policy and functionality of the underlying chmod system call.  When in  doubt,  check
       the underlying system behavior.

       chmod preserves a directory's set-user-ID and set-group-ID bits unless you explicitly specify otherwise.  You
       can set or clear the bits with symbolic modes like u+s and g-s, and you can set (but not clear) the bits with
       a numeric mode.

RESTRICTED DELETION FLAG OR STICKY BIT
       The  restricted  deletion  flag or sticky bit is a single bit, whose interpretation depends on the file type.
       For directories, it prevents unprivileged users from removing or renaming a file in the directory unless they
       own the file or the directory; this is called the restricted deletion flag for the directory, and is commonly
       found on world-writable directories like /tmp.  For regular files on some older systems, the  bit  saves  the
       program's text image on the swap device so it will load more quickly when run; this is called the sticky bit.

OPTIONS
       Change the mode of each FILE to MODE.  With --reference, change the mode of each FILE to that of RFILE.

       -c, --changes
              like verbose but report only when a change is made

       -f, --silent, --quiet
              suppress most error messages

       -v, --verbose
              output a diagnostic for every file processed

       --no-preserve-root
              do not treat '/' specially (the default)

       --preserve-root
              fail to operate recursively on '/'

       --reference=RFILE
              use RFILE's mode instead of MODE values

       -R, --recursive
              change files and directories recursively

       --help display this help and exit

       --version
              output version information and exit

       Each MODE is of the form '[ugoa]*([-+=]([rwxXst]*|[ugo]))+|[-+=][0-7]+'.
