NAME
       chown - change file owner and group

SYNOPSIS
       chown [OPTION]... [OWNER][:[GROUP]] FILE...
       chown [OPTION]... --reference=RFILE FILE...

DESCRIPTION
       This  manual  page documents the GNU version of chown.  chown changes the user and/or group ownership of each
       given file.  If only an owner (a user name or numeric user ID) is given, that user is made the owner of  each
       given  file,  and  the files' group is not changed.  If the owner is followed by a colon and a group name (or
       numeric group ID), with no spaces between them, the group ownership of the files is changed as  well.   If  a
       colon  but no group name follows the user name, that user is made the owner of the files and the group of the
       files is changed to that user's login group.  If the colon and group are given, but  the  owner  is  omitted,
       only  the  group of the files is changed; in this case, chown performs the same function as chgrp.  If only a
       colon is given, or if the entire operand is empty, neither the owner nor the group is changed.

OPTIONS
       Change the owner and/or group of each FILE to OWNER and/or GROUP.  With --reference,  change  the  owner  and
       group of each FILE to those of RFILE.

       -c, --changes
              like verbose but report only when a change is made

       -f, --silent, --quiet
              suppress most error messages

       -v, --verbose
              output a diagnostic for every file processed

       --dereference
              affect the referent of each symbolic link (this is the default), rather than the symbolic link itself

       -h, --no-dereference
              affect  symbolic links instead of any referenced file (useful only on systems that can change the own‐
              ership of a symlink)

       --from=CURRENT_OWNER:CURRENT_GROUP
              change the owner and/or group of each file only if its current owner and/or group match  those  speci‐
              fied here.  Either may be omitted, in which case a match is not required for the omitted attribute

       --no-preserve-root
              do not treat '/' specially (the default)

       --preserve-root
              fail to operate recursively on '/'

       --reference=RFILE
              use RFILE's owner and group rather than specifying OWNER:GROUP values

       -R, --recursive
              operate on files and directories recursively

       The following options modify how a hierarchy is traversed when the -R option is also specified.  If more than
       one is specified, only the final one takes effect.

       -H     if a command line argument is a symbolic link to a directory, traverse it

       -L     traverse every symbolic link to a directory encountered

       -P     do not traverse any symbolic links (default)

       --help display this help and exit

       --version
              output version information and exit

       Owner is unchanged if missing.  Group is unchanged if missing, but changed to login group if implied by a ':'
       following a symbolic OWNER.  OWNER and GROUP may be numeric as well as symbolic.

EXAMPLES
       chown root /u
              Change the owner of /u to "root".

       chown root:staff /u
              Likewise, but also change its group to "staff".

       chown -hR root /u
              Change the owner of /u and subfiles to "root".
