APLAYMIDI(1)                                   General Commands Manual                                  APLAYMIDI(1)



NAME
       aplaymidi - play Standard MIDI Files


SYNOPSIS
       aplaymidi -p client:port[,...] [-d delay] midifile ...


DESCRIPTION
       aplaymidi  is  a  command-line  utility  that  plays the specified MIDI file(s) to one or more ALSA sequencer
       ports.


OPTIONS
       -h, --help
              Prints a list of options.


       -V, --version
              Prints the current version.


       -l, --list
              Prints a list of possible output ports.


       -p, --port=client:port,...
              Sets the sequencer port(s) to which the events in the MIDI file(s) are sent.

              A client can be specified by its number, its name, or a prefix of its name. A port is specified by its
              number; for port 0 of a client, the ":0" part of the port specification can be omitted.

              Multiple  ports  can  be  specified to allow playback of MIDI file(s) that contain events for multiple
              devices (ports), as specified by "Port Number" meta events.

              For compatibility with pmidi(1), the port specification is taken from the  ALSA_OUTPUT_PORTS  environ‐
              ment variable if none is given on the command line.


       -d, --delay=seconds
              Specifies how long to wait after the end of each MIDI file, to allow the last notes to die away.


BUGS
       aplaymidi handles "Port Number" meta events, but not "Port Name" meta events.
