NAME
       gamma4scanimage - create a gamma table for scanimage

SYNOPSIS
       gamma4scanimage gamma [shadow [highlight [maxin [maxout]]]]


DESCRIPTION
       The tool gamma4scanimage creates a gamma table in the format expected by scanimage. You can define a gamma, a
       shadow and a highlight value. You also can specify the size (maxin) and maximum output value (maxout) of  the
       gamma table.

       gamma  is  a  floating point value, neutral value is 1.0, if the value is larger than 1.0 then the image gets
       brighter.

       shadow defines the minimum input value that is necessary to create an output value larger than zero.   shadow
       has to be in the range [0..maxin]. Its default value is 0.

       highlight  defines  the maximum input value that produces an output value smaller than maxout.  highlight has
       to be in the range [0..maxin], highlight has to be larger than shadow. Its default value is the same as maxin
       (16383 if not set).

       maxin  defines  the  size of the gamma table. The size depends on the scanner/backend.  If the scanner uses 8
       bits gamma input then maxin has to be set to 255, for 10 bits 1023, for 12 bits 4095, for 14 bits 16383.  The
       default  is  16383.   To  find  out  what  value maxin has to be call scanimage with a very large gamma table
       [0]0-[99999]255 then scanimage prints an error message with the needed size of the gamma table.

       maxout defines the maximum output value. Take a look at the output of scanimage -h to find  out  what  maxout
       has to be. The default value is 255.

EXAMPLE
       scanimage --custom-gamma=yes --gamma-table `gamma4scanimage 1.8 0 11500 16383 255` >image.pnm
