DESCRIPTION
       LibreOffice (LO for short) is a multi-platform office productivity suite.  It was derived from OpenOffice.org
       3.3 Beta on September 28, 2010.

       libreoffice  is a shell script that sets up the environment and passes the command line arguments to the sof‐
       fice.bin binary.

       Alternatively, the following helper scripts start the respective module:

       sbase, scalc, sdraw, simpress, smath, sofficerc, spadmin, swriter


OPTIONS
       --accept=accept-string
              Specify a UNO connect-string to create a UNO acceptor through which  other  programs  can  connect  to
              access the API.


       --base Starts the wizard for a new Base document.


       --calc Starts with a new Calc document.


       --convert-to output_file_extension[:output_filter_name] [--outdir output_dir] file...
              Batch  converts files.  If --outdir is not specified then the current working directory is used as the
              output directory for the converted files.

              Examples:

              --convert-to pdf *.doc

              Converts all .doc files to PDFs.

              --convert-to pdf:writer_pdf_Export --outdir /home/user *.doc

              Converts all .doc files to PDFs using the settings in the Writer PDF export dialog and saving them  in
              /home/user.


       --display display
              This option specifies the X server to use; see X(7)


       --draw Starts with a new Draw document.


       --global
              Starts with a new Global document.


       --headless
              Starts in "headless mode", which allows using the application without user a interface.

              This special mode can be used when the application is controlled by external clients via the API.

              It implies --invisible and strictly ignores any GUI environment.  --quickstart does not work with this
              parameter.


       --help|-h|-?
              Lists LibreOffice command line parameters.


       --impress
              Starts with a new Impress document.


       --invisible
              Starts in invisible mode.

              Neither the start-up logo nor the initial program window will be visible.  LO can  be  controlled  and
              documents and dialogs can be opened via the API.

              When started with this parameter, it can only be quit using the taskmanager (Windows) or the kill com‐
              mand (UNIX based systems).

              --quickstart does not work with this parameter.


       --infilter="<filter>"
              Force an input filter type if possible.  For example --infilter="Calc Office Open XML" only


       --math Starts with a new Math document.


       --minimized
              Keeps the splash screen minimized.


       -n template...
              Creates the a new document from the given templates.


       --nodefault
              Starts LO without creating a new document.  The next time you start LO, the welcome screen is shown.

              It's used together with --nologo by quick starters. Note that --quickstart has  no  longer  been  sup‐
              ported since OpenOffice.org 2.0.0.


       --nolockcheck
              Disables the check for remote instances using the installation.


       --nologo
              Disables the splash screen at program start.


       --norestore
              Disables  restart and file recovery after a system crash. It is possible that LO will try to restore a
              file it keeps crashing on, if that happens --norestore is the only way to start LO.


       --nosplash
              Disables the splash screen at program start.


       -o file...
              Opens the given files for editing, even templates.

              Without -o a template file would create a new document derived from that template.


       -p file...
              Prints the given files to the default printer and ends. The splash screen does not appear.

              If the file name contains spaces, then it must be enclosed in quotation marks.


       --print-to-file [--printer-name printer_name] [--outdir output_dir] file...
              Batch print files to file.  If --printer-name is not specified the default printer is used.  If --out‐
              dir  is  not specified then the current working directory is used as the output directory for the con‐
              verted files.

              Examples:

              --print-to-file *.doc

              Prints all .doc files to the current working directory using the default printer.

              --print-to-file --printer-name nasty_lowres_printer --outdir /home/user *.doc

              Prints all .doc files to /home/user directory using the nasty_lowres_printer.


       --pt printername file...
              Prints the given files to the printer printername and ends. The splash screen does not appear.

              If a file name contains spaces, then it must be enclosed in quotation marks.


       --quickstart --quickstart=no
              Starts LO with it's quick starter.  --quickstart disable the quick starter.

              Does not work with --invisible or --headless.


       --show Impress file...
              Opens the given Impress files, starts the presentation and quits after they have finished.


       --unaccept=accept-string
              Closes an acceptor that was created with --accept option.

              Use --unaccept=all to close all open acceptors.


       --terminate_after_init
              Starts LO and terminates after it registers  some  UNO  services.   Doesn't  show  the  splash  during
              startup.


       --view file...
              Opens the given files read-only creating a temporary copy of them at $TMPDIR.


       --web  Starts with a new HTML document.


       --writer
              Starts with a new Writer document.
