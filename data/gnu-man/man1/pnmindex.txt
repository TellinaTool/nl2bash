NAME
       pnmindex - build a visual index of a bunch of anymaps

SYNOPSIS
       pnmindex [-size N] [-across N] [-colors N] [-black] [-title T] [-quant|-noquant] pnmfile ...


DESCRIPTION
       pnmindex creates an index image containing thumbnail (small) versions of a bunch of PNM files you supply.

       pnmindex labels each thumbnail and, optionally, contains a title.



OPTIONS
       -size N
              The  size  of  each  thumbnail.  The image is scaled to fit maximally inside a N x N pixel box without
              changing its aspect ratio.  Default is 100.

       -across N
              The number of thumbnails in each row.  Default is 6.

       -colors N
              The maximum number of colors allowed in the overall image.  If it would  otherwise  have  more  colors
              than these, pnmindex quantizes the result.  The default is 256.

              However, this value is meaningless if you specify the -noquant option.

       -black This  controls  the  color  of  the padding between the images; normally it's white and the labels are
              black lettering on white background, but the -black flag reverses this.

       -title title
              Specifies a title top place at the top of the image.  Default is no title.

       -quant Enables quanization (to the number of colors specified by -colors ).  Quantization is  on  by  default
              but you can disable it with -noquant.

       -noquant
              See -quant.
