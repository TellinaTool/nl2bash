       ciptool [ options ] < command >

              The command is applied to device hciX , which must be the name or the address of  an  installed  Blue‐
              tooth device. If not specified, the command will be use the first available Bluetooth device.

COMMANDS

       search Search for Bluetooth devices and connect to first one that offers CIP support.

       connect <bdaddr> [psm]
              Connect  the  local  device  to  the remote Bluetooth device on the specified PSM number. If no PSM is
              specified, it will use the SDP to retrieve it from the remote device.

       release [bdaddr]
              Release a connection to the specific device. If no address is given and only one device  is  connected
              this will be released.

       loopback <bdaddr> [psm]
              Create  a connection to the remote device for Bluetooth testing.  This command will not provide a CAPI
              controller, because it is only for testing the CAPI Message Transport Protocol.
