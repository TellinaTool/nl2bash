GENDICT(1)                                         ICU 52.1 Manual                                        GENDICT(1)



NAME
       gendict - Compiles word list into ICU string trie dictionary

SYNOPSIS
       gendict [ --uchars | --bytes --transform transform ] [ -h, -?, --help ] [ -V, --version ] [ -c, --copyright ]
       [ -v, --verbose ] [ -i, --icudatadir directory ]  input-file  output-file

DESCRIPTION
       gendict reads the word list from dictionary-file and creates a string trie  dictionary  file.  Normally  this
       data file has the .dict extension.

       Words  begin  at  the  beginning of a line and are terminated by the first whitespace.  Lines that begin with
       whitespace are ignored.

OPTIONS
       -h, -?, --help
              Print help about usage and exit.

       -V, --version
              Print the version of gendict and exit.

       -c, --copyright
              Embeds the standard ICU copyright into the output-file.

       -v, --verbose
              Display extra informative messages during execution.

       -i, --icudatadir directory
              Look for any necessary ICU data files in directory.  For example, the file pnames.icu must be  located
              when  ICU's data is not built as a shared library.  The default ICU data directory is specified by the
              environment variable ICU_DATA.  Most configurations of ICU do not require this argument.

       --uchars
              Set the output trie type to UChar. Mutually exclusive with --bytes.

       --bytes
              Set the output trie type to Bytes. Mutually exclusive with --uchars.

       --transform
              Set the transform type. Should only be specified with --bytes.  Currently  supported  transforms  are:
              offset-<hex-number>,  which  specifies  an offset to subtract from all input characters.  It should be
              noted that the offset transform also maps U+200D to 0xFF and U+200C to 0xFE, in order to offer compat‐
              ibility  to  languages that require these characters.  A transform must be specified for a bytes trie,
              and when applied to the non-value characters in the input-file must produce output  between  0x00  and
              0xFF.

        input-file
              The source file to read.

        output-file
              The file to write the output dictionary to.

CAVEATS
       The  input-file  is  assumed  to be encoded in UTF-8.  The integers in the input-file that are used as values
       must be made up of ASCII digits. They may be specified either in hex, by using a 0x prefix,  or  in  decimal.
       Either --bytes or --uchars must be specified.

ENVIRONMENT
       ICU_DATA  Specifies  the directory containing ICU data. Defaults to ${prefix}/share/icu/52.1/.  Some tools in
                 ICU depend on the presence of the trailing slash. It is thus important to  make  sure  that  it  is
                 present if ICU_DATA is set.
