NAME
       sed - stream editor for filtering and transforming text

SYNOPSIS
       sed [OPTION]... {script-only-if-no-other-script} [input-file]...

DESCRIPTION
       Sed  is a stream editor.  A stream editor is used to perform basic text transformations on an input stream (a
       file or input from a pipeline).  While in some ways similar to an editor which permits scripted  edits  (such
       as  ed),  sed works by making only one pass over the input(s), and is consequently more efficient.  But it is
       sed's ability to filter text in a pipeline which particularly distinguishes it from other types of editors.

       -n, --quiet, --silent

              suppress automatic printing of pattern space

       -e script, --expression=script

              add the script to the commands to be executed

       -f script-file, --file=script-file

              add the contents of script-file to the commands to be executed

       --follow-symlinks

              follow symlinks when processing in place

       -i[SUFFIX], --in-place[=SUFFIX]

              edit files in place (makes backup if SUFFIX supplied)

       -l N, --line-length=N

              specify the desired line-wrap length for the `l' command

       --posix

              disable all GNU extensions.

       -r, --regexp-extended

              use extended regular expressions in the script.

       -s, --separate

              consider files as separate rather than as a single continuous long stream.

       -u, --unbuffered

              load minimal amounts of data from the input files and flush the output buffers more often

       -z, --null-data

              separate lines by NUL characters

       --help
              display this help and exit

       --version
              output version information and exit

       If no -e, --expression, -f, or --file option is given, then the first non-option argument is taken as the sed
       script to interpret.  All remaining arguments are names of input files; if no input files are specified, then
       the standard input is read.

COMMAND SYNOPSIS
       This is just a brief synopsis of sed commands to serve as a reminder to those who  already  know  sed;  other
       documentation (such as the texinfo document) must be consulted for fuller descriptions.

   Zero-address ``commands''
       : label
              Label for b and t commands.

       #comment
              The comment extends until the next newline (or the end of a -e script fragment).

       }      The closing bracket of a { } block.

   Zero- or One- address commands
       =      Print the current line number.

       a \

       text   Append text, which has each embedded newline preceded by a backslash.

       i \

       text   Insert text, which has each embedded newline preceded by a backslash.

       q [exit-code]
              Immediately  quit  the  sed script without processing any more input, except that if auto-print is not
              disabled the current pattern space will be printed.  The exit code argument is a GNU extension.

       Q [exit-code]
              Immediately quit the sed script without processing any more input.  This is a GNU extension.

       r filename
              Append text read from filename.

       R filename
              Append a line read from filename.  Each invocation of the command reads a line from the file.  This is
              a GNU extension.

   Commands which accept address ranges
       {      Begin a block of commands (end with a }).

       b label
              Branch to label; if label is omitted, branch to end of script.

       c \

       text   Replace the selected lines with text, which has each embedded newline preceded by a backslash.

       d      Delete pattern space.  Start next cycle.

       D      If pattern space contains no newline, start a normal new cycle as if the d command was issued.  Other‐
              wise, delete text in the pattern space up to the first newline, and restart cycle with  the  resultant
              pattern space, without reading a new line of input.

       h H    Copy/append pattern space to hold space.

       g G    Copy/append hold space to pattern space.

       l      List out the current line in a ``visually unambiguous'' form.

       l width
              List  out  the current line in a ``visually unambiguous'' form, breaking it at width characters.  This
              is a GNU extension.

       n N    Read/append the next line of input into the pattern space.

       p      Print the current pattern space.

       P      Print up to the first embedded newline of the current pattern space.

       s/regexp/replacement/
              Attempt to match regexp against the pattern space.  If successful, replace that portion  matched  with
              replacement.  The replacement may contain the special character & to refer to that portion of the pat‐
              tern space which matched, and the special escapes \1 through \9 to refer to the corresponding matching
              sub-expressions in the regexp.

       t label
              If  a  s/// has done a successful substitution since the last input line was read and since the last t
              or T command, then branch to label; if label is omitted, branch to end of script.

       T label
              If no s/// has done a successful substitution since the last input line was read and since the last  t
              or  T  command,  then  branch  to  label; if label is omitted, branch to end of script.  This is a GNU
              extension.

       w filename
              Write the current pattern space to filename.

       W filename
              Write the first line of the current pattern space to filename.  This is a GNU extension.

       x      Exchange the contents of the hold and pattern spaces.

       y/source/dest/
              Transliterate the characters in the pattern space which appear in source to the corresponding  charac‐
              ter in dest.

Addresses
       Sed  commands can be given with no addresses, in which case the command will be executed for all input lines;
       with one address, in which case the command will only be executed for input lines which match  that  address;
       or  with two addresses, in which case the command will be executed for all input lines which match the inclu‐
       sive range of lines starting from the first address and continuing to the second address.   Three  things  to
       note about address ranges: the syntax is addr1,addr2 (i.e., the addresses are separated by a comma); the line
       which addr1 matched will always be accepted, even if addr2 selects an earlier line; and if addr2 is a regexp,
       it will not be tested against the line that addr1 matched.

       After  the address (or address-range), and before the command, a !  may be inserted, which specifies that the
       command shall only be executed if the address (or address-range) does not match.

       The following address types are supported:

       number Match only the specified line number (which increments cumulatively across files, unless the -s option
              is specified on the command line).

       first~step
              Match  every  step'th  line starting with line first.  For example, ``sed -n 1~2p'' will print all the
              odd-numbered lines in the input stream, and the address 2~5 will match every fifth line, starting with
              the  second.   first can be zero; in this case, sed operates as if it were equal to step.  (This is an
              extension.)

       $      Match the last line.

       /regexp/
              Match lines matching the regular expression regexp.

       \cregexpc
              Match lines matching the regular expression regexp.  The c may be any character.

       GNU sed also supports some special 2-address forms:

       0,addr2
              Start out in "matched first address" state, until addr2 is found.  This is similar to 1,addr2,  except
              that  if  addr2 matches the very first line of input the 0,addr2 form will be at the end of its range,
              whereas the 1,addr2 form will still be at the beginning of its range.  This works only when addr2 is a
              regular expression.

       addr1,+N
              Will match addr1 and the N lines following addr1.

       addr1,~N
              Will match addr1 and the lines following addr1 until the next line whose input line number is a multi‐
              ple of N.

REGULAR EXPRESSIONS
       POSIX.2 BREs should be supported, but they  aren't  completely  because  of  performance  problems.   The  \n
       sequence  in  a  regular  expression  matches  the  newline  character,  and  similarly for \a, \t, and other
       sequences.

BUGS
