NAME
       pdfflip - rotate the pages of pdf files

SYNOPSIS
       pdfflip [OPTION [OPTION] ...] [SRC [PAGESPEC] [SRC [PAGESPEC]] ...]

DESCRIPTION
       pdfflip reflects (left-right) the pages of files in the Adobe Portable Document Format (PDF).

       If no source PDF file ('SRC') is specified, input is from /dev/stdin. If 'PAGESPEC' is omitted, all pages are
       processed.

       Source files are processed sequentially into a single output unless the '--batch' option is  used,  in  which
       case they are processed separately.

       pdfflip  operates  on  one  or  more PDF files, and (either with the '--batch' option or with '--outfile DIR'
       where 'DIR' is a directory) the resulting files have the suffix '-flipped' applied to their names by default.
       To change the suffix, use the '--suffix' option, for example

              pdfflip --suffix 'reflected' --batch myfile1.pdf myfile2.pdf

       will result in files named 'myfile1-reflected.pdf' and 'myfile2-reflected.pdf'.

       pdfflip  is  a  simple  wrapper  for pdfjam, which is a front end to many of the capabilities of the pdfpages
       package for pdflatex.  A working installation of pdflatex with the pdfpages package is required.

       pdfflip is part of the "PDFjam" package of tools, whose homepage is at http://go.warwick.ac.uk/pdfjam.
