NAME
       texdoctk - GUI for easier access of TeX package and program documentations

SYNOPSIS
       texdoctk -[aq]

DESCRIPTION
       texdoctk  is a GUI for easier access to a large part of the vast amount of package and program documentations
       and tutorials for TeX and its different derivatives (mainly LaTeX). It is optimized and included in the teTeX
       and fpTeX distributions and also available with TeXLive.

       The documentation is grouped into 17 categories; the 18th button of the main panel is inactive by default and
       intended for use with local additions (see section CONFIGURATION below).

       In the settings window you see a checkbox in the html->ps and text->ps converter menus for  switching  on/off
       output  redirect.  This  is due to the fact that some converters do not write their output into a file but to
       stdout by default, so a redirect is needed, e.g.

       a2ps myfile.txt >myfile.ps

OPTIONS
       -v     verbose: enable some viewer messages which are otherwise sent to stderr, as well as some warning popup
              windows. This can also be set in a configuration file.

       -a     autoview:  autostart viewer if a listbox contains only one item (this will frequently happen in search
              results). This can also be set in a configuration file.

CONFIGURATION
       The  configuration  is  controlled  by  the  system  default  configuration  file  ($TEXMFMAIN)/texdoctk/tex‐
       docrc.defaults,  most  of whose entries can though be overridden by the users' own optional ~/.texdocrc files
       and/or command line options.

   The Settings menu and configuration files
       The Settings menu is used to change the user-definable settings of texdoctk for the duration of  the  program
       call  or  as new defaults. The latter case is the purpose of the Save button, which generates or rewrites the
       user's own ~/.texdocrc file. The system defaults cannot be edited with the Settings menu.

       Paths  The TEXMF-type paths on the system are reported, and the user can specify the name of the subdirectory
              of $HOMETEXMF, where the personal documentation is stored.

       General viewer behaviour

              Suppress error messages toggle verbose mode (see option -v); default is off.

              Autostart viewer for one-item listboxes if a listbox contains only one item (see option -a)

              Use  text  viewer for unknown file format i.e. treat the file as plain text. texdoctk should recognize
              the usual file formats and also relate names like README to plain text, but some docs may have  freely
              invented  names.  Default  is  on; if switched off, trying to view such files will raise an error. The
              switch does not influence printing: unrecognized formats cannot be printed.

              Change viewer colours using either RGB triplets in the format #rrggbb or the standardized names.

       DVI/PostScript/PDF/HTML/Plain text
              For text files, texdoctk provides an own viewer. If this viewer is disabled, but no alternative viewer
              is specified, texdoctk tries to read the content of the environment variable $PAGER.

              If  you  want  to  print  the documentations, you will need converters to turn non-PS files into Post‐
              Script. Here are some suggestions:

               dvi->ps: dvips (is part of teTeX) (http://www.radicaleye.com/dvips.html)

               pdf->ps: pdf2ps (http://www.cs.wisc.edu/~ghost) or Acrobat Reader (http://www.adobe.com)

               html->ps: html2ps (http://user.it.uu.se/~jan/html2ps.html)

               plain text->ps: a2ps (http://www-inf.enst.fr/~demaille/a2ps/)

              The html->ps and text->ps converter menus for switching on/off output redirect.  This is  due  to  the
              fact  that  some converters do not write their output into a file but to stdout by default, so a redi‐
              rect is needed, e.g.  a2ps myfile.txt >myfile.ps

       The system-wide configuration file is ($TEXMFMAIN)/texdoctk/texdocrc.defaults and should only be writable  by
       the  administrator of the installation using any text editor. The optional user configuration file is ~/.tex‐
       docrc and can override all but those system settings which affect the installation as a whole. The  preferred
       way of changing it is through the Settings menu.

   The databases
       texdoctk  comes  with a default database file ($TEXMFMAIN)/texdoctk/texdoctk.dat with a special format. It is
       divided into 17 sections corresponding to the 17 buttons that are active by default. Each section begins with
       a line

       @section_name

       where section_name is the text as it appears in the button. This title is followed by the descriptive entries
       for each documentation, which have this format:

       package-label;Short description for listbox (opt. package-name);path in doc directory;optional keywords

       (without breaking the line!). Comments (initiated with a #) and empty lines are ignored by the  program.  The
       second  field is the text displayed in the selection listboxes of texdoctk, and you will usually want to men‐
       tion the name of the package in parens along with it; the first field is a unique label for the  package  for
       internal  use of the program which will usually be chosen identical to the package name, but can be different
       if there is more than one documentation file coming with a package.

       The administrator will probably install additional packages in the local texmf tree. The corresponding  docu‐
       mentation  can be made accessible by an additional database $TEXMFLOCAL/texdoctk/texdoctk-local.dat. Further‐
       more, individual users possibly install additional packages in an texmf  subdirectory  of  their  $HOME,  for
       which  they can make an individual database themselves as $TEXMFHOME/texdoctk/texdoctk-pers.dat. After creat‐
       ing such files, texhash must be executed.

       Both types of databases must have the same structure as the system database, although they need (and  should)
       not include all its sections if there are no additional entries. For example, if the the package foo is added
       to the local tree such that its documentation file is ($TEXMFLOCAL)/doc/latex/foo/foo.dvi and it  is  decided
       that it fits best into the existing category Graphics, texdoctk-local.dat would look like this:

       @Graphics
       foo;Create bells and whistles (foo);latex/foo/foo.dvi;decoration

       The  entry for foo will then be appended to the list of entries in the Graphics category. The 18th button can
       be activated in the same way, but using a new category name; possible entries at the beginning of  the  data‐
       base  which  have  not  been assigned to a category will be assigned to the default Miscellaneous, making the
       18th button active with that label. Note that you cannot have more than 18 categories;  if  there  are  more,
       only the one defined last will appear and be used.

       If  the  documentation is included in the .sty file instead of a proper documentation file, the optional key‐
       words should start with -?- directly after the semicolon, where ? is 0, 1, 2 or  3;  these  are  flags  which
       indicate  in which part of the .sty the instructions are placed and should help texdoctk to extract the docu‐
       mentation from the style and present it without the code, which would normally be of little use.

       0      no specific place, scattered between the code

       1      at end, behind \endinput; some .sty files have well-organized documentation  behind  the  end  of  the
              actual code, where TeX doesn't see it upon compilation

       2      at beginning, terminated by %%%%%%; in some other cases, some usage information is at the beginning of
              the .sty as a comment terminated by a line full of %

       3      as 2, but with a blank line as termination

       See the system database for plenty of examples.


FILES
        $TEXMFMAIN/texdoctk/texdocrc.defaults system-wide configuration file

        ~/.texdocrc (optional) personal configuration file; can also be created with the Settings menu

        $TEXMFMAIN/texdoctk/texdoctk.dat default database file for documentation files of the distribution

        $TEXMFLOCAL/texdoctk/texdoctk-local.dat (optional) local database file for documentation files

        $TEXMFHOME/texdoctk/texdoctk-pers.dat (optional) personal database file of individual users  for  documenta‐
       tion files

BUGS
       Widget placement in topic toplevels becomes ugly when the toplevel is stretched or shrunk.

       The  font in the frame labels of the Settings menu are not forced to the default font; this will become visi‐
       ble e.g. at hi-res screens, where the label font is not scaled up.

       Netscape and Mozilla error output will be written to stderr even if the quiet mode was set.
