NAME
       bibtex - make a bibliography for (La)TeX

SYNOPSIS
       bibtex [-min-crossrefs=number] [-terse] auxname[.aux]

DESCRIPTION
       This  manual  page  is not meant to be exhaustive.  The complete documentation for this version of TeX can be
       found in the info file or manual Web2C: A TeX implementation.

       BibTeX reads the top-level auxiliary (.aux) file auxname that was output during the running  of  latex(1)  or
       tex(1)  and creates a bibliography (.bbl) file that will be incorporated into the document on subsequent runs
       of LaTeX or TeX.

       BibTeX looks up, in bibliographic database (.bib) files specified by the \bibliography command,  the  entries
       specified by the \cite and \nocite commands in the LaTeX or TeX source file.  It formats the information from
       those entries according to instructions in a bibliography style (.bst) file (specified by the  \bibliography‐
       style command, and it outputs the results to the .bbl file.

       The  LaTeX manual explains what a LaTeX source file must contain to work with BibTeX.  Appendix B of the man‐
       ual describes the format of the .bib files. The `BibTeXing' document describes extensions and details of this
       format, and it gives other useful hints for using BibTeX.

OPTIONS
       The  -min-crossrefs  option  defines  the  minimum number of crossref required for automatic inclusion of the
       crossref'd entry on the citation list; the default is two.  With the -terse option, BibTeX operates silently.
       Without it, a banner and progress reports are printed on stdout.

ENVIRONMENT
       BibTeX  searches the directories in the path defined by the BSTINPUTS environment variable for .bst files. If
       BSTINPUTS is not set, it uses the system default.  For .bib files, it uses the BIBINPUTS environment variable
       if that is set, otherwise the default.  See tex(1) for the details of the searching.

       If the environment variable TEXMFOUTPUT is set, BibTeX attempts to put its output files in it, if they cannot
       be put in the current directory.  Again, see tex(1).  No special searching is done for the .aux file.

FILES
       *.bst  Bibliography style files.

       btxdoc.tex
              ``BibTeXing'' - LaTeXable documentation for general BibTeX users

       btxhak.tex
              ``Designing BibTeX Styles'' - LaTeXable documentation for style designers

       btxdoc.bib
              database file for those two documents

       xampl.bib
              database file giving examples of all standard entry types

       btxbst.doc
              template file and documentation for the standard styles

       All those files should be available somewhere on your system.

       The host math.utah.edu has a vast collection of .bib files available for anonymous ftp, including  references
       for all the standard TeX books and a complete bibliography for TUGboat.

       Oren  Patashnik,  Stanford  University.  This man page describes the web2c version of BibTeX.  Other ports of
       BibTeX, such as Donald Knuth's version using the Sun Pascal compiler, do not have  the  same  path  searching
       implementation, or the command-line options.
