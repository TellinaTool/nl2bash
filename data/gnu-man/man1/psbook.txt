NAME
       psbook - rearrange pages in PostScript file into signatures

SYNOPSIS
       psbook [ -q ] [ -ssignature ] [ infile [ outfile ] ]

DESCRIPTION
       Psbook rearranges pages from a PostScript document into ``signatures'' for printing books or booklets, creat‐
       ing a new PostScript file. The input PostScript file should follow the  Adobe  Document  Structuring  Conven‐
       tions.

       The  -s  option  selects  the size of signature which will be used. The signature size is the number of sides
       which will be folded and bound together; the number given should be a multiple of four. The default is to use
       one  signature for the whole file. Extra blank sides will be added if the file does not contain a multiple of
       four pages.

       Psbook normally prints the page numbers of the pages rearranged; the -q option suppresses this.
