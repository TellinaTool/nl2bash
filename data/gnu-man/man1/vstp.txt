VSTP(1)                                         BrlAPI User's Manual                                         VSTP(1)



NAME
       vstpg, vstpp - VisioBraille file transferring

SYNOPSIS
       vstpg [-ifbnd] [-s socketport] [-k keyname] [-o configname] file ...

DESCRIPTION
       vstpg (resp. vstpp) gets (resp. puts) files from (resp. onto) a VisioBraille terminal.

       For communicating with the terminal, you must launch brltty with the BrlNet driver, and telling BrlNet to use
       the VisioBraille driver.

       Before putting on the terminal, file names are truncated to 8 characters without any extension.

       Before getting from terminal, leading path and trailing extensions are removed, but put back for local  file‐
       name.


COMMAND-LINE OPTIONS
       -i     ask for confirmation of transfer, for each file (on the terminal)

       -f     don't ask for such a confirmation (default)

       -b     if they exists, recursively rename the old files with an added .x suffix, just like logrotate does

       -n     do not keep such backup file (default)

       -s socketport
              use socketport as the port number instead of default for connecting to BrlNet

       -k filename
              use filename as key path instead of default for reading BrlNet's authentication key

       -d     use current directory rather than the download directory (see vbs_dir below)

       -o filename
              also read filename as config file


CONFIG FILE
       vstpg  and  vstpp read a configuration file $HOME/.vstprc which contains keywords or equalities, one per line
       (what follows a # is ignored).

       You can ask them to also read any other file thanks to the -o option.

       Here are keywords:


       backup make -b option the default


       nobackup
              make -f option the default


       and equalities:


       keyname = filename
              use this file instead of default, to find BrlNet's authentication key


       socketport = port
              use this port number, instead of default, to connect to BrlNet


       vbs_ext = .ext
              use .ext as an extension for downloaded files (.vis by default) this is overriden on command  line  if
              an extension is provided in the file name


       vbs_dir = path
              use  path  instead  of current directory for putting files, except when using the -d option, or if the
              filename begins with '.'


RETURNED VALUE
       1    syntax error on command line
       2    connection with BrlNet error
       3    Unix file error
       4    Protocol error
       16   interrupted by user


SHELL EXPANSIONS
       Beware of special chars: * and . are often expanded by your shell, hence vstpp * will probably  do  what  you
       want, putting every file existing in the current directory onto the terminal, but vstpg * may not do what you
       want: it will only get every file which already exist in the current directory, skipping those you just  cre‐
       ated  on your terminal !  If you want to get every file which exist in the terminal, you should use vstpg '*'
       or something similar (please read your shell manual).

       The same warning applies to other special chars, such as $, ~, &,... which should be protected by surrounding
       arguments by quotes (') or by using single backslashes (\) just before them (please read your shell manual).


BUGS
       The one we could find has been corrected :)
