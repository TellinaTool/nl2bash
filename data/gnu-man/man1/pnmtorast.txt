NAME
       pnmtorast - convert a portable pixmap into a Sun rasterfile

SYNOPSIS
       pnmtorast [-standard|-rle] [pnmfile]

DESCRIPTION
       Reads a portable pixmap as input.  Produces a Sun rasterfile as output.

       Color  values  in Sun rasterfiles are eight bits wide, so pnmtorast will automatically scale colors to have a
       maxval of 255.  An extra pnmdepth step is not necessary.

OPTIONS
       The -standard flag forces the result to be in RT_STANDARD form; the  -rle  flag,  RT_BYTE_ENCODED,  which  is
       smaller but, well, less standard.  The default is -rle.

       All flags can be abbreviated to their shortest unique prefix.
