DESCRIPTION
       You can use filterdiff to obtain a patch that applies to files matching the shell wildcard PATTERN from a
       larger collection of patches. For example, to see the patches in patch-2.4.3.gz that apply to all files
       called lp.c:

           filterdiff -z -i '*/lp.c' patch-2.4.3.gz

       If neither -i nor -x options are given, -i '*' is assumed. This way filterdiff can be used to clean up an
       existing diff file, removing redundant lines from the beginning (eg. the text from the mail body) or between
       the chunks (eg. in CVS diffs). To extract pure patch data, use a command like this:

           filterdiff message-with-diff-in-the-body > patch

       Note that the interpretation of the shell wildcard pattern does not count slash characters or periods as
       special (in other words, no flags are given to fnmatch). This is so that “*/basename”-type patterns can be
       given without limiting the number of pathname components.

       You can use both unified and context format diffs with this program.

OPTIONS
       -i PATTERN, --include=PATTERN
           Include only files matching PATTERN. All other lines in the input are suppressed.

       -I FILE, --include-from-file=FILE
           Include only files matching any pattern listed in FILE, one pattern per line. All other lines in the
           input are suppressed.

       -x PATTERN, --exclude=PATTERN
           Exclude files matching PATTERN. All other lines in the input are displayed.

       -X FILE, --exclude-from-file=FILE
           Exclude files matching any pattern listed in FILE, one pattern per line. All other lines in the input are
           displayed.

       -p n, --strip-match=n
           When matching, ignore the first n components of the pathname.

       -# RANGE, --hunks=RANGE
           Only include hunks within the specified RANGE. Hunks are numbered from 1, and the range is a
           comma-separated list of numbers or “first-last” spans; either the first or the last in the span may be
           omitted to indicate no limit in that direction.

       --lines=RANGE
           Only include hunks that contain lines from the original file that lie within the specified RANGE. Lines
           are numbered from 1, and the range is a comma-separated list of numbers or “first-last” spans; either the
           first or the last in the span may be omitted to indicate no limit in that direction.

       --files=RANGE
           Only include files indicated by the specified RANGE. Files are numbered from 1 in the order they appear
           in the patch input, and the range is a comma-separated list of numbers or “first-last” spans; either the
           first or the last in the span may be omitted to indicate no limit in that direction.

       --annotate
           Annotate each hunk with the filename and hunk number.

       --format=unified|context
           Use specified output format.

       --strip=n
           Remove the first n components of pathnames in the output.

       --addprefix=PREFIX
           Prefix pathnames in the output by PREFIX. This will override any individual settings specified with the
           --addoldprefix or --addnewprefix options.

       --addoldprefix=PREFIX
           Prefix pathnames for old or original files in the output by PREFIX.

       --addnewprefix=PREFIX
           Prefix pathnames for updated or new files in the output by PREFIX.

       --as-numbered-lines=before|after
           Instead of a patch fragment, display the lines of the selected hunks with the line number of the file
           before (or after) the patch is applied, followed by a TAB character and a colon, at the beginning of each
           line. Each hunk except the first will have a line consisting of “...”  before it.

       --remove-timestamps
           Do not include file timestamps in the output.

       -v, --verbose
           Always show non-diff lines in the output. By default, non-diff lines are only shown when excluding a
           filename pattern.

       --clean
           Always remove all non-diff lines from the output. Even when excluding a filename pattern.

       -z, --decompress
           Decompress files with extensions .gz and .bz2.

       --help
           Display a short usage message.

       --version
           Display the version number of filterdiff.

       --list
           Behave like lsdiff(1) instead.

       --grep
           Behave like grepdiff(1) instead.

EXAMPLES
       To see all patch hunks that affect the first five lines of a C file:

           filterdiff -i '*.c' --lines=-5 < patch

       To see the first hunk of each file patch, use:

           filterdiff -#1 patchfile

       To see patches modifying a ChangeLog file in a subdirectory, use:

           filterdiff -p1 Changelog

       To see the complete patches for each patch that modifies line 1 of the original file, use:

           filterdiff --lines=1 patchfile | lsdiff | \
             xargs -rn1 filterdiff patchfile -i

       To see all but the first hunk of a particular patch, you might use:

           filterdiff -p1 -i file.c -#2- foo-patch

       If you have a very specific list of hunks in a patch that you want to see, list them:

           filterdiff -#1,2,5-8,10,12,27-

       To see the lines of the files that would be patched as they will appear after the patch is applied, use:

           filterdiff --as-numbered-lines=after patch.file

       You can see the same context before the patch is applied with:

           filterdiff --as-numbered-lines=before
           patch.file

       Filterdiff can also be used to convert between unified and context format diffs:

           filterdiff -v --format=unified context.diff
