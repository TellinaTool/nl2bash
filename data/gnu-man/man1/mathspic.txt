DESCRIPTION
       mathsPIC  is  a  Perl filter program for PiCTeX. mathsPIC has its own macro and macro library capability, and
       allows use of mathsPIC, PiCTeX, TeX and LaTeX commands. A significant feature of mathsPIC is that  it  allows
       access to the command-line, and so allows the user to extend mathsPIC commands by calling Perl and other pro‐
       grams written to perform particular drawing actions. See the package manual for full  details  and  examples.
       The latest version can be downloaded from

       CTAN: tex-archive/graphics/pictex/mathspic/perl

       Commands which can be used in the mathsPIC script file fall into four main groups (a) mathsPIC macro commands
       (prefixed with %def), (b) regular mathsPIC commands (do not have a backslash), (c)  regular  PiCTeX  commands
       (all have a backslash), and (d) regular TeX and LaTeX commands (all have a backslash).

       The  following mathematics functions can used (note that decimal fractions having an absolute value less than
       1 must have a leading zero). Note also that all the trignometric functions require their argument in radians.

       Trigonometric: sin(), cos(), tan(), asin(), acos(), atan()

       Remainder: rem(); eg var  r=12 rem(5)

       Integer: int(); eg var  r= int(3.87) --> 3

       Sign (returns -1, 0, +1): sgn(); eg var  s=sgn(-3.27) --> -1

       Square root: sqrt(); eg var s = sqrt(14)

       Exponentiation: **; eg var j = r**2

       Pi constant (3.14159...):  _Pi_  and  _pi_

       e constant (2.71828...):  _E_  and  _e_

       Linethickness:  _linethickness_  ; eg  var t = _linethickness_


COMMAND-LINE USE
       perl mathspic.pl [-b] [-c] [-h] [-o  <outfile>]  <infile>

       -b enables beep if mathsPIC detects an error

       -c disables the writing of comments to output file

       -h displays the help file

       -o defines the output file name

MACRO COMMANDS
       macro definition commands are prefixed with %def and can take  either 0, 1, or more parameters.  Macros  will
       generally be used as part of a var command as shown below. Macros are deleted using the %undef command.

        -----syntax:
        %def MACRONAME(parameters)<macrodefinition>
        %undef MACRONAME(parameters)

        -----notes:
        Notes:  (a)  the  ()  must be used in the definition even if no parameters are used, (b) the name can be any
       combination of upper and lower case characters and numbers, (c) when the macro is used in  a  command  it  is
       prefixed  by  a  & symbol, (d) it is a good idea to always place a % symbol at the end of the definition, (e)
       comments (prefixed by a % symbol) can be placed after the macro definition just as in TeX or LaTeX.

        -----examples:
        %def d2r()_pi_/180%              % degrees2radians
        %def AreaOfRectangle(x,y)x*y%    % width x, length y
        %undef d2r()                     % delete the macro

        -----use:
        var j2= 6*(&d2r(45) + 23)
        var a3 = 3*&AreaOfRectangle(5,7)

GENERAL COMMANDS
       NUMERICAL EXPRESSIONS
        When dealing with commands we will refer frequently to the term `numerical expression'  by  which  is  meant
       either  (a) a number (integer or decimal), (b) a numeric variable or constant (defined using the var or const
       command), (c) any mathsPIC function, macro, or mathematical expression which evaluates to a number, or (d)  a
       pair  of  point  names (e.g. AB) representing the Pythagorean distance between the two points. A leading zero
       must be used  with decimal fractions less than one.

        In general, if a command's argument accepts a number then it  will  also  accept  a  `numerical  expression'
       (<expr>)  as  defined  above. Sometimes a following <unit> is associated with the number or numerical expres‐
       sion, in which case the number or numerical expression can be delimited by a round bracket (or separated from
       the unit by a <space>), as shown in the following examples.

        -----examples:
        ArrowShape(3mm, 20,40)
        var h=4
        ArrowShape(h mm, 20, 40)
        ArrowShape((2*h)mm,20,40)


       BACKSLASH \
        A  leading  backslash without a following space indicates that it is part of a PiCTeX, TeX or LaTeX command,
       in  which case mathsPIC simply copies the whole line verbatim into the output file. A leading backslash  fol‐
       lowed  by one or more spaces makes mathsPIC copy the whole line verbatim into the output file but without the
       backslash.


       USING THE COLOR PACKAGE
        The standard COLOR package can be used with mathsPIC, but note that it is important to load the COLOR  pack‐
       age  after the mathsPIC package.

         It  is  best  to  place a comment symbol % at the end of LaTeX and TeX commands to limit white space at the
       end.

        In the event of any colour-spill from a diagram into any following text (this used to be a problem in  early
       TeX implementations) consider using the \normalcolor  command as a delimiter within the \beginpicture...\end‐
       picture environment.

       ==============================

       ARROWSHAPE
        This command defines the shape of an arrowhead, and allows different arrowheads to be customised.

       The default arrow shape is equivalent to the Arrowshape(2mm,30,40) command.  This default arrowhead shape can
       be reset using the Arrowshape(default) command, as shown in the following example.

        -----syntax:
        arrowshape(<length>[units], <angledeg>, <angledeg>)

        -----examples:
        Arrowshape(4mm,30,60)
        drawArrow(AB)
        Arrowshape(default)

       ==============================

       beginLOOP...endLOOP
        This is an environment which cycles a block of code a specified number of times.

        -----syntax:
        beginLoop <expr>
        ...
        endLoop

        -----notes:
        The block of code which lies within the environment is input <expr> times.

        -----example:
        beginLoop 5
        ...
        endLoop


       ==============================

       beginSKIP...endSKIP
        This  is  an  `environment'  within which commands are not actioned. It is useful in development for testing
       isolated commands and excluding other commands.

       ==============================

       CONST
        The const command is used to define  scalar  constants. Note that a constant-name must begin with  a  single
       letter  (either  upper or lower case), and may have up to a maximum of three following digits. Note that con‐
       stants, variables and points have the same name structure, and a constant could have the same name as a point
       (and  so  we  suggest points have uppercase letters and variables and constants  have lowercase letters). The
       scalar argument can be  any numeric expression. New values cannot   be  re-allocated  to  existing  constant-
       names. If this occurs mathsPIC will issue an error message.

        -----syntax:
        const name = <expr>

        -----examples:
        const r = 20, r4 = r3*tan(0.3)

       ==============================

       DashArray
        The dasharray command takes an arbitrary number of paired arguments that are used to specify a dash pattern.

        -----syntax
        dasharray(d1 , g1 , d2 , g2 , ... )

        -----notes
        The ds denotes the length of a dash and the gs denotes the length of the gap between two consecutive dashes.
       There must be an even number of arguments. If a variable or expression is used then it  should  be  separated
       from the unit either by a <space> or with round brackets ( ) as shown below.

        -----example
        dasharray(6pt, 2pt, 1pt, 2pt)
        var d=2
        dasharray(6pt, 2pt, 1pt, d pt)
        dasharray(6pt, 2pt, 1pt, (d)pt)
        dasharray(6pt, 2pt, 1pt, (3*d)pt)

       ==============================

       DrawAngleArc
        This  command  draws  an arc in the specified angle, a distance <radius> from the angle. The angle is either
       <internal> (less than 180 deg) or <external> (greater than 180 deg). The  direction  of  the  arc  is  either
       <clockwise> or <anticlockwise>, and this direction must correspond with the letter sequence specified for the
       angle.  Strange and unexpected results will be produced if the four parameters are not internally consistent.
       The  option  order  angle/radius/internal  or  external/clockwise or anticlockwise is important. The <radius>
       parameter can be any numerical expression.

        -----syntax:
        DrawAngleArc{angle(), radius(), external, clockwise}

        -----example:
        DrawAngleArc{angle(ABC), radius(3), external, clockwise}
        var r=3
        DrawAngleArc{angle(ABC), radius(r), external, clockwise}

       ==============================

       DrawAngleArrow
        This command draws a curved arrow in the specified angle, a distance <radius> from the angle. The  angle  is
       either  <internal>  (less  than  180 deg) or <external> (greater than 180 deg). The direction of the arrow is
       either <clockwise> or <anticlockwise>, and this direction must correspond with the letter sequence  specified
       for  the  angle.   Strange  and unexpected results will be produced if the four parameters are not internally
       consistent. The option order angle/radius/internal/clockwise is important. The <radius> parameter can be  any
       numerical expression.

        -----syntax:
        DrawAngleArrow{angle(), radius(), external, clockwise}

        -----example:
        DrawAngleArrow{angle(ABC), radius(3), external, clockwise}
        var r=3
        DrawAngleArrow{angle(ABC), radius(r), external, clockwise}

       ==============================

       DrawArrow
        This  command  draws an arrow(s) joining two points. The direction of the arrow is in the point order speci‐
       fied.

        -----syntax:
        drawArrow(<line> [,<line>] ... )

        -----notes:
        The length option can only refer to one arrow

        -----example:
        drawArrow(AB)
        drawArrow(FG, HJ)

       ==============================

       DrawCircle
        This command draws a circle defined by its radius and the point-name of its centre. The <radius> can be  any
       numerical  expression.  If  the  units of the X and Y axes are different, circles may be drawn strangely, and
       mathsPIC therefore generates a warning message to this effect.

        -----syntax:
        DrawCircle(<center>, <radius>)

        -----examples:
        drawCircle(C2,5)
        drawCircle(C2,r2)
        drawCircle(C2,r2/tan(1.3))
        drawCircle(C2,AB)

       ==============================

       DrawCircumcircle
        This command draws the circumcircle of a triangle.

        -----syntax:
        DrawCircumcircle(<triangle>)

        -----example:
        drawCircumcircle(ABC)

       ==============================

       DrawCurve
        This command draws a smooth quadratic curve through three points in the point  order  specified.  Note  that
       curves drawn using this command do not break to avoid line-free zones associated with the points.

        -----syntax:
        DrawCurve(<point><point><point>)

        -----example:
        drawCurve(ABC)

       ==============================

       DrawExcircle
        This command draws the excircle touching one side of a triangle.

        -----syntax:
        DrawExcircle(<triangle>, <side>)

        -----example:
        drawExcircle(ABC, BC)

       ==============================

       DrawIncircle
        This command draws the incircle of a triangle.

        -----syntax:
        DrawIncircle(<triangle>)

        -----example:
        drawIncircle(ABC)

       ==============================

       DrawLine
        This  command draws a line joining two or more points. Use the Linethickness command to vary thickness. This
       command uses the PiCTeX \putrule command for horizontal and vertical lines, and the  \plot  command  for  all
       other orientations.

        -----syntax:
        DrawLine( <points> [, <points>] )

        -----notes:
        <points> is any sequence of two or more point names.
        <expr> is any numerical expression.
        Lines are drawn in the order specified.
        Lines are separated by a comma.

        -----examples:
        drawline(AB)
        drawline(BCDE)
        drawline(FG, HJK, PQRST)

       ==============================

       DrawPerpendicular
        This command draws the perpendicular from a point to a line.

        -----syntax:
        DrawPerpendicular(<point>, <line)

        -----example:
        drawPerpendicular(P,AB)

       ==============================

       DrawPoint
        This command draws the point-symbol at the  point-location. Commas must not be used to separate point names.
       The default point-symbol is bullet unless an optional point-symbol (or string of characters) is specified  in
       the associated point command.

        -----syntax:
        DrawPoint(<point> [<point> ..])

        -----examples:
        drawpoint(T4)
        drawpoint(ABCDEF)
        drawpoint(P1 P2 P3 P4)

       ==============================

       DrawRightangle
        This  command draws the standard right-angle symbol in the internal angle specified at the size specified by
       <expr>.

        -----syntax:
        DrawRightangle(<angle>, <expr>)

        -----notes:
        The <expr> can be any numerical expression.

        -----example:
        drawRightangle(ABC,3)
        drawRightangle(ABC,PQ)
        var d=5
        drawRightangle(ABC,d)

       ==============================

       DrawSquare
        This command draws a square defined by its side and the point-name of its centre. The  <sidelength>  can  be
       any numerical expression.

        -----syntax:
        DrawSquare(<centerpoint>, <sidelength>)

        -----examples:
        drawSquare(P,5)
        var s2=3, j=2
        drawSquare(P,s2)
        drawSquare(P, s2*4/(3*j))
        drawSquare(P,AB)

       ==============================

       DrawThickArrow
        This  command  draws  a  thick arrow(s) joining two points. The direction of the arrow is in the point order
       specified. The shape of the arrowhead is controlled by the ArrowShape command.

        -----syntax:
        drawThickArrow(<line> [,<line>,...])

        -----examples:
        drawThickarrow(BC)
        drawThickarrow(PQ, RS)

       ==============================

       DrawThickLine
        This command draws a thick line(s) joining two points. The direction of the line is in the point order spec‐
       ified. Use the Linethickness command to vary thickness of a line.

        -----syntax:
        drawThickLine(<line> [,<line>,...])

        -----examples:
        drawThickline(BC)
        drawThickline(PQ, RS)

       ==============================

       InputFile
        This  command  inputs a plain text file containing mathsPIC commands. Optionally, the file can be input sev‐
       eral times, in which case this command functions like a DO--LOOP.  The  <loopnumber>  can  be  any  numerical
       expression.  If  the  <loopnumber>  is  not an integer then mathsPIC will round the value down to the nearest
       integer. See also the beginLOOP ... endLOOP commands.

        -----syntax:
        inputFile[*](<filename>)[<loopnumber>]

        -----notes:
        The inputfile* command is used to input a file in verbatim, i.e. a file with no mathsPIC commands, for exam‐
       ple, a file containing only PiCTeX commands or data-points for plotting etc. Note that the inputfile* command
       has no <loopnumber> option. Note also that PiCTeX requires a ODD number of points.

        -----examples:
        inputFile(myfile.dat)[4]
        inputFile*(mycurvedata.dat)

       ==============================

       LineThickness
        This command sets a particular  linethickness.  The  command  linethickness(default)  restores  the  working
       linethickness  to  the default value of 0.4pt.  The current value of the linethickness (in current units) can
       be accessed using the var command (this can be useful when drawing figures using thick lines) .

        -----syntax:
        LineThickness(<expr><units>)
        LineThickness(default)
        var t = _linethickness_

        -----notes:
        This command also sets the font to cmr and plotsymbol to \CM . and also sets the rule thickness for  drawing
       horizontal  and  vertical  lines.  It is important to include a leading zero with decimal fractions less than
       one.

        -----examples:
        linethickness(2pt)
        var t=3
        linethickness((t)pt)
        lineThickness((2*t)pt)
        linethickness(default)
        var t = _linethickness_

        -----caution:
        Note that there is a similar PiCTeX  command  with the same name (but with a different syntax).

       ==============================

       PAPER
        Defines the plotting area in terms of the options units(), xrange(),  yrange(),  axes(),  and  ticks().  The
       units()  argument  must  contain a numeric value and a valid TeX length unit  mm, cm, pt, pc(pica), in(inch),
       bp(big point), dd(didot), cc(cicero), sp(scaled point). The X and Y axes can have different units (see second
       example  below).  The axes() arguments XYTBLR refer to the X and Y axes, and  the Top, Bottom, Left and Right
       axes. A * following one of the axes disables ticks on that axis. The X and Y axes pass through the zeros.

        -----examples:
        paper{units(1cm),xrange(0,10),yrange(0,10)}
        paper{units(2cm,1cm),xrange(0,10),yrange(0,10),axes(LB)}
        paper{units(1mm),xrange(0,100),yrange(0,100),axes(XY)}
        paper{units(1cm),xrange(-5,5),yrange(-5,5),axes(LRTBXY),ticks(1,1)}
        paper{units(1cm),xrange(-5,5),yrange(-5,5),axes(LRT*B*)}

       ==============================

       POINT
        Defines a new point by allocating coordinates to a new point name. The * option re-allocates coordinates  to
       an existing point name.

        -----syntax:
        POINT[*](<name>){<point>}[symbol=<chars>, radius=<expr>]
        POINT[*](<name>){<location>}[symbol=<chars>, radius=<expr>]

        -----notes:
        <name> one leading letter plus maximum of three trailing digits
        <chars> any TeX string allowed in an \hbox{}
        <expr> any numerical expression
        The  polar(r,theta)  option   defaults  to  radians for the angle theta. To work in degrees then must append
       <deg> eg: polar(r,theta deg). Can use  <direction()> and <directiondeg()> to replace  theta.  Note  that  the
       term  vector(AB) means use same (r, theta) as AB.

        -----examples:
        point(A){5,5}
        point(B2){22,46}[symbol=$\odot$]
        point(B2){22,46}[symbol=circle(2),radius=5]
        var r=3
        point(B2){22,46}[symbol=square(3),radius=r]
        point(B123){22,46}[radius=5]
        point(D2){B2, shift(5,5)}
        var s = 3
        point(D2){B2, shift(2*s,4*s)}
        point(D3){D2, polar(6,32 deg)}
        point(D4){D2, polar(6,1.2 rad)}
        point(D4){D2, polar(6, direction(AB))}      %% radians by default
        point(D4){D2, polar(6, directiondeg(AB) deg)}
        point(G2){Q, rotate(P, 23 deg)}
        point(G2){Q, vector(AB)}
        point(D2){intersection(AB,CD)}
        point(F){PointOnLine(AB,5.3)}
        point(G){perpendicular(P,AB)}
        point(H){circumcircleCenter(ABC)}
        point(J){incircleCenter(ABC)}
        point(K){excircleCenter(ABC,BC)}
        point*(A){6,3}
        point*(P){Q}
        point*(B){B, shift(5,0)}
        point*(P){xcoord(J),ycoord(K)}

       ==============================

       PointSymbol
        This  command  allows  the  default  point-symbol  \bullet  (with  zero line-free radius) to be changed. The
       PointSymbol command is particularly useful where a set of points uses the  same  point-symbol,  for  example,
       when  drawing  graphs.  The  point-symbol  can  be  reset to the default \bullet  using the command PointSym‐
       bol(default).

        -----syntax:
        PointSymbol(<symbol>, <line-free-radius>)
        PointSymbol(default)

        -----notes:
        The PointSymbol command only influences subsequent point commands.
        The optional square bracket of the point command overrides the PointSymbol command.

        -----examples:
        PointSymbol($\odot$, 0.7)
        PointSymbol(default)

        This command allows the user to access the command line and execute standard Linux commands. A important use
       for this command is to run a Perl program.

        -----syntax:
        System("<command>")

        -----notes:
        The <command> string must be in inverted commas.

        -----example:
        system("dir > mydir-listing.txt")
        system("perl myperlprogram.pl")

       ==============================

       SHOW....
        This command makes mathsPIC return the value of a calculation or specified parameter; for example, the value
       of a particular angle, or the length of a line. The result is shown in the output-file as a  commented  line.
       This  allows  mathsPIC  commands  to be adjusted in the light of  calculations. There are currently five such
       commands as follows.

        -----syntax:
        showLength(AB)
        showAngle(ABC)       % returns angle in radians
        showAngledeg(ABC)    % returns angle in degrees
        showArea(ABC)
        showPoints
        showVariables

       ==============================

       TEXT
        This command places a text-string at a specific location. By default the text  is  centered  vertically  and
       horizontally  at  the  specified  point. Optionally, text can be placed relative to a point using appropriate
       combinations of the PiCTeX  `position' options l t r B b to align the (l)eft edge, (r)ight edge, (t)op  edge,
       (B)aseline, (b)ottom edge respectively of the text box with the point-location.

        Remember  that the default units for the angle argument of the polar() expression is radians; hence you MUST
       append `deg' if you want to work in degrees

        -----syntax:
        text(<string>){<location>}[<position options>]
        text(<string>){<pointname>, shift(<x>,<y>)}[]
        text(<string>){<pointname>, polar(<r>,<angle>[rad])}[]

        -----examples:
        text(A){5,6}
        text($A_1$){A1, shift(2, 2)}
        text(Z2){Z2, shift(5, -5)}[tr]
        text(Z3){Z2, polar(5, 20 deg)}[Br]
        text(Z4){Z2, polar(5, 1.34 rad)}
        text(\framebox{Z5}){Z5}

       ==============================

       VAR
        The var command is used to define scalar variables. It can be any numerical expression. A variable-name must
       begin  with a single letter (either upper or lower case), and may have up to a maximum of four following dig‐
       its. If a more detailed variable name is required, then a simple alternative is to use a mathsPIC  macro---as
       any string can be allocated via macros (see the beginning of this chapter for details on macros).

         Note  that  variables,  constants and points have the same name structure, and a variable can have the same
       name as a point (and so we suggest points have uppercase letters and variables and constants  have  lowercase
       letters).  New values can be re-allocated to existing variable-names; however, when this occurs then mathsPIC
       does not issue a warning message to hightlight this fact.

        If it is important to be warned if a potential variable is accidentally reallocated then one should consider
       using the const command instead (since mathsPIC does generate an error message if a constant is reallocated).

        -----syntax:
        var  <name> = <expr>

        -----notes:
        In addition to the mathematical functions mathsPIC functions which can be used with the var command are:

        angle(<three-points>)          % returns angle in radians
        angledeg(<three-points>)       % returns angle in degrees
        area(<three-points>)
        xcoord(<point>)
        ycoord(<point>)
        direction(<two-points>)     % returns angular direction in radians
        directiondeg(<two-points>)  % returns angular direction in degrees

        -----examples:
        var r = 20, r4 = r3*tan(0.3), j = (r*2e3)**2,  r5 = AB
        var e = _e_, p1 = _Pi_
        var t = _linethickness_  % returns linethickness in current units
        var g137 = angle(ABC)    %(default: returns in radians)
        var g = angledeg(ABC)    % angle in degrees
        var h = area(ABC)
        var x2 = xcoord(A), y2 = ycoord(A)
        var m5 = 12 rem 3     % remainder after dividing by 3
        var r1 = direction(PQ)   % in radians
        var d1 = directiondeg(PQ)
