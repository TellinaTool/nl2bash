NAME
       pnmconvol - general MxN convolution on a portable anymap

SYNOPSIS
       pnmconvol convolutionfile [pnmfile]

DESCRIPTION
       Reads  two  portable anymaps as input.  Convolves the second using the first, and writes a portable anymap as
       output.

       Convolution means replacing each pixel with a weighted average of the nearby pixels.   The  weights  and  the
       area  to  average are determined by the convolution matrix.  The unsigned numbers in the convolution file are
       offset by -maxval/2 to make signed numbers, and then normalized, so the actual values in the convolution file
       are only relative.

       Here  is  a sample convolution file; it does a simple average of the nine immediate neighbors, resulting in a
       smoothed image:
           P2
           3 3
           18
           10 10 10
           10 10 10
           10 10 10

       To see how this works, do the above-mentioned offset: 10 - 18/2 gives 1.  The possible  range  of  values  is
       from  0  to 18, and after the offset that's -9 to 9.  The normalization step makes the range -1 to 1, and the
       values get scaled correspondingly so they become 1/9 - exactly what you want.  The equivalent matrix for  5x5
       smoothing would have maxval 50 and be filled with 26.

       The  convolution file will usually be a graymap, so that the same convolution gets applied to each color com‐
       ponent.  However, if you want to use a pixmap and do a different convolution to  different  colors,  you  can
       certainly do that.

       At  the  edges  of the convolved image, where the convolution matrix would extend over the edge of the image,
       pnmconvol just copies the input pixels directly to the output.
