Xmark(1)                                       General Commands Manual                                      Xmark(1)



NAME
       Xmark - summarize x11perf results

SYNTAX
       Xmark datafile

DESCRIPTION
       Xmark  is  a shell script that reads the indicated datafile and compiles a benchmark which it writes to stan‐
       dard output.  It writes three numbers:

              A weighted performance number for the x11perf results.

              A weighted performance number for a standard SparcStation 1, with SunOS 4.1.2, X11R5 Xsun, and  a  CG3
              dumb Color Frame Buffer.

              The Xmark, which is the ratio of the two numbers above.

       The datafile must be an ordinary file, produced by x11perf in the following way:

       x11perf -display display -v1.3 -rop GXcopy GXxor -all > datafile

       It  is  possible  to  run the GXcopy and GXxor tests separately, as long as they are concatenated to the same
       output file:
       x11perf -display display -v1.3 -rop GXcopy -all > datafile
       x11perf -display display -v1.3 -rop GXxor -all >> datafile
       or
       x11perf -display display -v1.3 -rop GXxor -all > datafile
       x11perf -display display -v1.3 -rop GXcopy -all >> datafile

FILES
       temp.$$
              Temporary file created in the current directory, deleted after use.

DIAGNOSTICS
       Usage: Xmark datafile
              Xmark was invoked without arguments or with more than one argument, or with options.  Xmark  takes  no

       Error: data file does not exist or is not ordinary.
              Xmark  cannot find the datafile named on its command line, or the datafile is a special file such as a
              directory.

       WARNING: datafile contains nnn, not 441 or 447 'trep' results;
              The file named on the command line does not seem to be a file generated by  x11perf  in  the  expected
              way.

       Diagnostic: ERROR: sum of weights =nnn, not equal to 4566.0;
              There is an internal error in Xmark.
