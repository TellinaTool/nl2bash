NAME
       dvd+rw-format - format DVD+-RW/-RAM disk


SYNOPSIS
       dvd+rw-format [-force[=full]] [-lead-out | -blank[=full]] [-ssa[=none | default | max]] /dev/dvd


DESCRIPTION
       The dvd+rw-format command formats dvd disk in the specified dvd drive (e.g. /dev/dvd).


OPTIONS
       -force[=full]
              This forces to format dvd as new while wiping any existing data.

       -blank[=full]
              This blanks dvd while changing to sequential mode.

       -lead-out
              This  relocates the lead-out next to outermost written sector as well as makes sure there is no virgin
              surface before it. Previously written data is not affected by this operation.  Useful  for  addressing
              DVD-ROM compatibility, or playability of already recorded media in legacy units.
