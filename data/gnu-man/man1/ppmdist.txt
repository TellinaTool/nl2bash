NAME
       ppmdist - simplistic grayscale assignment for machine generated, color images

SYNOPSIS
       ppmdist [-intensity|-frequency] [ppmfile]

DESCRIPTION
       Reads  a portable pixmap as input, performs a simplistic grayscale assignment intended for use with grayscale
       or bitmap printers.

       Often conversion from ppm to pgm will yield an image with contrast too low for good printer output.  The pro‐
       gram maximizes contrast between the gray levels output.

       A  ppm  input of n colors is read, and a pgm of n gray levels is written.  The gray levels take on the values
       0..n-1, while maxval takes on n-1.

       The mapping from color to stepped grayscale can be performed in order of  input  pixel  intensity,  or  input
       pixel frequency (number of repetitions).

OPTIONS
       -frequency    Sort input colors by the number of times a color appears in the input, before mapping to
                     evenly distributed  graylevels  of  output.   -intensity  Sort  input  colors  by  their
                     grayscale intensity, before mapping to evenly distributed graylevels of output.  This is
                     the default.

BUGS
       Helpful only for images with a very small number of colors.  Perhaps should have  been  an  option  to
       ppmtopgm(1).
