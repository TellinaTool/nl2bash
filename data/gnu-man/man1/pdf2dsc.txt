PDF2DSC(1)                                        Ghostscript Tools                                       PDF2DSC(1)



NAME
       pdf2dsc - generate a PostScript page list of a PDF document

SYNOPSIS
       pdf2dsc input.pdf [ output.dsc ]

DESCRIPTION
       pdf2dsc  uses  gs(1)  to read an Adobe Portable Document Format (PDF) document "input.pdf" and create a Post‐
       Script(tm) document "output.dsc" that conforms to Adobe's Document  Structuring  Conventions  (DSC)  require‐
       ments.

       This new document simply tells Ghostscript to read the PDF file and to display pages one at a time.  The gen‐
       erated document can then be viewed with any PostScript viewer based on Ghostscript, like ghostview(1) on Unix
       or GSview on Windows, with which the user can browse through the pages of the PDF document in any order.

       If  no  output  file is named on the command line, the name of the output file is that of the input file with
       any extension removed, followed by the extension ".dsc".

CAVEATS
       The DSC document uses Ghostscript-specific procedures.  In addition, the original PDF document must be acces‐
       sible when the DSC document is processed.

       You need the file "pdf2dsc.ps" (originally by Russell Lang) supplied with Ghostscript since release 3.53.
