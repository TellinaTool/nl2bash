NAME
       uz - gunzips and extracts a gzip'd tar'd archive

SYNOPSIS
       uz file

DESCRIPTION
       uz  extracts a gzip'd tar'd archive, that is a tar(1) archive compressed with the gzip(1) utility.  It is not
       strictly necessary on Debian GNU/Linux, because the GNU tar(1) program provides the same capability with  the
       command

       tar -xzf file

       but this utility is provided in the mtools package for other platforms and is retained here for completeness.
