GROTTY(1)                                      General Commands Manual                                     GROTTY(1)



NAME
       grotty - groff driver for typewriter-like devices

SYNOPSIS
       grotty [ -bBcdfhioruUv ] [ -Fdir ] [ files... ]

       It is possible to have whitespace between the -F option and its parameter.

DESCRIPTION
       grotty  translates the output of GNU troff into a form suitable for typewriter-like devices.  Normally grotty
       should be invoked by using the groff command with a -Tascii, -Tlatin1 or -Tutf8 option on  ASCII  based  sys‐
       tems,  and  with -Tcp1047 and -Tutf8 on EBCDIC based hosts.  If no files are given, grotty reads the standard
       input.  A filename of - also causes grotty to read the standard input.  Output is  written  to  the  standard
       output.

       By  default, grotty emits SGR escape sequences (from ISO 6429, also called ANSI color escapes) to change text
       attributes (bold, italic, colors).  This makes it possible to have eight different background and  foreground
       colors; additionally, bold and italic attributes can be used at the same time (by using the BI font).

       The following colors are defined in tty.tmac: black, white, red, green, blue, yellow, magenta, cyan.  Unknown
       colors are mapped to the default color (which is dependent on the settings of the terminal;  in  most  cases,
       this is black for the foreground and white for the background).

       Use  the -c switch to revert to the old behaviour, printing a bold character c with the sequence `c BACKSPACE
       c' and an italic character c by the sequence `_ BACKSPACE c'.  At the same time, color  output  is  disabled.
       The  same effect can be achieved by setting either the GROFF_NO_SGR environment variable or using the `sgr' X
       command (see below).

       For SGR support, it is necessary to use the -R option of less(1) to disable the  interpretation  of  grotty's
       old  output  format.  Consequently, all programs which use less as the pager program have to pass this option
       to it.  For man(1) in particular, either add -R to the $PAGER environment variable, e.g.

              PAGER="/usr/bin/less -R"
              export PAGER

       or use the -P option of man to set the pager executable and its options, or modify the configuration file  of
       man  in  a  similar  fashion.  Note that with some man(1) versions, you have to use the $MANPAGER environment
       variable instead.

       grotty's old output format can be displayed on a terminal by piping through ul(1).  Pagers such as more(1) or
       less(1)  are also able to display these sequences.  Use either -B or -U when piping into less(1); use -b when
       piping into more(1).  There is no need to filter the output through col(1) since grotty never outputs reverse
       line feeds.

       The font description file may contain a command

              internalname n

       where  n is a decimal integer.  If the 01 bit in n is set, then the font is treated as an italic font; if the
       02 bit is set, then it is treated as a bold font.  The code field in the font  description  field  gives  the
       code which is used to output the character.  This code can also be used in the \N escape sequence in troff.

       If the DESC file contains the keyword unicode, grotty emits Unicode characters in UTF-8 encoding.  Otherwise,
       it emits characters in a single-byte encoding depending on the data in the font description files.   See  the
       groff_font(5) man page for more details.

OPTIONS
       -b     Suppress the use of overstriking for bold characters.  Ignored if -c isn't used.

       -B     Use only overstriking for bold-italic characters.  Ignored if -c isn't used.

       -c     Use grotty's old output format (see above).  This also disables color output.

       -d     Ignore  all  \D  commands.   Without this grotty renders \D'l...' commands that have at least one zero
              argument (and so are either horizontal or vertical) using -, |, and + characters.  In a  similar  way,
              grotty handles \D'p...' commands which consist entirely of horizontal and vertical lines.

       -f     Use form feeds in the output.  A form feed is output at the end of each page that has no output on its
              last line.

       -Fdir  Prepend directory dir/devname to the search path for font and device description files;  name  is  the
              name of the device, usually ascii, latin1, utf8, or cp1047.

       -h     Use horizontal tabs in the output.  Tabs are assumed to be set every 8 columns.

       -i     Use  escape  sequences  to set the italic text attribute instead of the underline attribute for italic
              fonts (`I' and `BI').  Note that most terminals (including xterm) don't support this.  Ignored  if  -c
              is active.

       -o     Suppress  overstriking (other than for bold or underlined characters in case the old output format has
              been activated with -c).

       -r     Use escape sequences to set the reverse text attribute instead of the underline attribute  for  italic
              fonts (`I' and `BI').  Ignored if -c is active.

       -u     Suppress the use of underlining for italic characters.  Ignored if -c isn't used.

       -U     Use only underlining for bold-italic characters.  Ignored if -c isn't used.

       -v     Print the version number.

USAGE
       grotty understands a single X command produced using the \X escape sequence.

       \X'tty: sgr n'
              If  n  is  non-zero or missing, enable SGR output (this is the default), otherwise use the old drawing
              scheme for bold and underline.

ENVIRONMENT
       GROFF_NO_SGR
              If set, the old drawing scheme for bold and underline (using the backspace character) is active.  Col‐
              ors are disabled.

       GROFF_FONT_PATH
              A  list  of  directories in which to search for the devname directory in addition to the default ones.
              See troff(1) and groff_font(5) for more details.

       Note that on EBCDIC hosts, only files for the cp1047 device is installed.

BUGS
       grotty is intended only for simple documents.

       There is no support for fractional horizontal or vertical motions.

       There is no support for \D commands other than horizontal and vertical lines.

       Characters above the first line (ie with a vertical position of 0) cannot be printed.

       Color handling is different compared to grops(1).  \M doesn't set the fill color for closed  graphic  objects
       (which  grotty  doesn't support anyway) but changes the background color of the character cell, affecting all
       subsequent operations.
