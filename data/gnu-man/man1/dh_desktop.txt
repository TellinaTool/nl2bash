NAME
       dh_desktop - deprecated no-op

SYNOPSIS
       dh_desktop [debhelper options]

DESCRIPTION
       dh_desktop was a debhelper program that registers .desktop files.  However, it no longer does anything, and
       is now deprecated.

       If a package ships desktop files, they just need to be installed in the correct location
       (/usr/share/applications) and they will be registered by the appropriate tools for the corresponding desktop
       environments.

SEE ALSO
       debhelper

       This program is a part of debhelper.
