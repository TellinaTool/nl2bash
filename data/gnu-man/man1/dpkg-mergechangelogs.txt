NAME
       dpkg-mergechangelogs - 3-way merge of debian/changelog files

SYNOPSIS
       dpkg-mergechangelogs [option...] old new-a new-b [out]

DESCRIPTION
       This  program  will  use the 3 provided versions of the Debian changelog to generate a merged changelog file.
       The resulting changelog is stored in the file out or output to the standard output if that parameter  is  not
       given.

       Each  entry  is  identified by its version number and they are assumed to be not conflicting, they are simply
       merged in the right order (by decreasing version number). When --merge-prereleases is used, the part  of  the
       version  number  after  the  last tilde is dropped so that 1.0-1~exp1 and 1.0-1~exp5 are considered to be the
       same entry. When the same version is available in both new-a and new-b, a standard line-based 3-way merge  is
       attempted  (provided  that  the  module  Algorithm::Merge  is  available  — it's part of the package libalgo‐
       rithm-merge-perl — otherwise you get a global conflict on the content of the entry).

OPTIONS
       --merge-prereleases, -m
              Drop the part after the last tilde in the version number when doing version comparison to identify  if
              two entries are supposed to be the same or not.

              This  is useful when you keep using the same changelog entry but you increase its version number regu‐
              larly. For instance, you might have 2.3-1~exp1, 2.3-1~exp2, ... until the official release  2.3-1  and
              they are all the same changelog entry that has evolved over time.

       --help Show the usage message and exit.

       --version
              Show the version and exit.

LIMITATIONS
       Anything  that  is not parsed by Dpkg::Changelog is lost during the merge.  This might include stuff like vim
       modelines, comments which were not supposed to be there, etc.

INTEGRATION WITH GIT
       If you want to use this program to merge Debian changelog files in a git repository, you have first to regis‐
       ter a new merge driver in .git/config or ~/.gitconfig:

        [merge "dpkg-mergechangelogs"]
            name = debian/changelog merge driver
            driver = dpkg-mergechangelogs -m %O %A %B %A

       Then  you  have  to  setup  the merge attribute for the debian/changelog file either in .gitattributes in the
       repository itself, or in .git/info/attributes:

        debian/changelog merge=dpkg-mergechangelogs
