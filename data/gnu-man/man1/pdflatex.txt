NAME
       pdftex, pdfinitex, pdfvirtex - PDF output from TeX

SYNOPSIS
       pdftex [options] [&format] [file|\commands]

DESCRIPTION
       Run  the pdfTeX typesetter on file, usually creating file.pdf.  If the file argument has no extension, ".tex"
       will be appended to it.  Instead of a filename, a set of pdfTeX commands can be given,  the  first  of  which
       must  start  with  a backslash.  With a &format argument pdfTeX uses a different set of precompiled commands,
       contained in format.fmt; it is usually better to use the -fmt format option instead.

       pdfTeX is a version of TeX, with the e-TeX extensions, that can create PDF files as well as DVI files.

       In DVI mode, pdfTeX can be used as a complete replacement for the TeX engine.

       The typical use of pdfTeX is with a pregenerated formats for which PDF output has been enabled.   The  pdftex
       command  uses  the  equivalent  of  the plain TeX format, and the pdflatex command uses the equivalent of the
       LaTeX format.  To generate formats, use the -ini switch.

       The pdfinitex and pdfvirtex commands are pdfTeX's analogues to the  initex  and  virtex  commands.   In  this
       installation, if the links exist, they are symbolic links to the pdftex executable.

       In PDF mode, pdfTeX can natively handle the PDF, JPG, JBIG2, and PNG graphics formats.  pdfTeX cannot include
       PostScript or Encapsulated PostScript (EPS) graphics files; first convert  them  to  PDF  using  epstopdf(1).
       pdfTeX's  handling of its command-line arguments is similar to that of of the other TeX programs in the web2c
       implementation.

OPTIONS
       This version of pdfTeX understands the following command line options.

       -draftmode
              Sets \pdfdraftmode so pdfTeX doesn't write a PDF and doesn't read any included images,  thus  speeding
              up execution.

       -enc   Enable the encTeX extensions.  This option is only effective in combination with -ini.  For documenta‐
              tion of the encTeX extensions see http://www.olsak.net/enctex.html.

       -etex  Enable the e-TeX extensions.  This option is only effective in combination with -ini.  See etex(1).

       -file-line-error
              Print error messages in the form file:line:error which is similar to the  way  many  compilers  format
              them.

       -no-file-line-error
              Disable printing error messages in the file:line:error style.

       -file-line-error-style
              This is the old name of the -file-line-error option.

       -fmt format
              Use  format  as the name of the format to be used, instead of the name by which pdfTeX was called or a
              %& line.

       -halt-on-error
              Exit with an error code when an error is encountered during processing.

       -help  Print help message and exit.

       -ini   Start in INI mode, which is used to dump formats.  The INI mode can be used for  typesetting,  but  no
              format is preloaded, and basic initializations like setting catcodes may be required.

       -interaction mode
              Sets  the interaction mode.  The mode can be either batchmode, nonstopmode, scrollmode, and errorstop‐
              mode.  The meaning of these modes is the same as that of the corresponding \commands.

       -ipc   Send DVI or PDF output to a socket as well as the usual output file.  Whether this option is available
              is the choice of the installer.

       -ipc-start
              As  -ipc,  and  starts  the  server at the other end as well.  Whether this option is available is the
              choice of the installer.

       -jobname name
              Use name for the job name, instead of deriving it from the name of the input file.

       -kpathsea-debug bitmask
              Sets path searching debugging flags according to the bitmask.  See the Kpathsea manual for details.

       -mktex fmt
              Enable mktexfmt, where fmt must be either tex or tfm.

       -mltex Enable MLTeX extensions.  Only effective in combination with -ini.

       -no-mktex fmt
              Disable mktexfmt, where fmt must be either tex or tfm.

       -output-comment string
              In DVI mode, use string for the DVI file comment instead of the date.  This option is ignored  in  PDF
              mode.

       -output-directory directory
              Write  output  files  in directory instead of the current directory.  Look up input files in directory
              first, the along the normal search path.

       -output-format format
              Set the output format mode, where format must be either pdf or dvi.  This also influences the  set  of
              graphics formats understood by pdfTeX.

       -parse-first-line
              If  the first line of the main input file begins with %& parse it to look for a dump name or a -trans‐
              late-file option.

       -no-parse-first-line
              Disable parsing of the first line of the main input file.

       -progname name
              Pretend to be program name.  This affects both the format used and the search paths.

       -recorder
              Enable the filename recorder.  This leaves a trace of the files opened for input and output in a  file
              with extension .fls.

       -shell-escape
              Enable the \write18{command} construct.  The command can be any shell command.  This construct is nor‐
              mally disallowed for security reasons.

       -no-shell-escape
              Disable the \write18{command} construct, even if it is enabled in the texmf.cnf file.

       -src-specials
              In DVI mode, insert source specials into the DVI file.  This option is ignored in PDF mode.

       -src-specials where
              In DVI mode, insert source specials in certain placed of the DVI file.   where  is  a  comma-separated
              value list: cr, display, hbox, math, par, parent, or vbox.  This option is ignored in PDF mode.

       -translate-file tcxname
              Use  the  tcxname  translation  table  to set the mapping of input characters and re-mapping of output
              characters.

       -default-translate-file tcxname
              Like -translate-file except that a %& line can overrule this setting.

       -version
              Print version information and exit.

ENVIRONMENT
       See the Kpathsearch library documentation (the `Path specifications' node) for precise  details  of  how  the
       environment variables are used.  The kpsewhich utility can be used to query the values of the variables.

       One  caveat: In most pdfTeX formats, you cannot use ~ in a filename you give directly to pdfTeX, because ~ is
       an active character, and hence is expanded, not taken as part of the filename.  Other programs, such as Meta‐
       font, do not have this problem.

       TEXMFOUTPUT
              Normally,  pdfTeX puts its output files in the current directory.  If any output file cannot be opened
              there, it tries to open it in the directory specified in the environment variable TEXMFOUTPUT.   There
              is no default value for that variable.  For example, if you say pdftex paper and the current directory
              is not writable and TEXMFOUTPUT has the value /tmp, pdfTeX  attempts  to  create  /tmp/paper.log  (and
              /tmp/paper.pdf, if any output is produced.)  TEXMFOUTPUT is also checked for input files, as TeX often
              generates files that need to be subsequently read; for input, no suffixes (such as ``.tex'') are added
              by default, the input name is simply checked as given.

       TEXINPUTS
              Search  path for \input and \openin files.  This should start with ``.'', so that user files are found
              before system files.  An empty path component will be replaced with the paths defined in the texmf.cnf
              file.   For  example,  set  TEXINPUTS  to  ".:/home/user/tex:"  to  prepend  the current directory and
              ``/home/user/tex'' to the standard search path.

       TEXFORMATS
              Search path for format files.

       TEXPOOL
              search path for pdftex internal strings.

       TEXEDIT
              Command template for switching to editor.  The default, usually vi, is set when pdfTeX is compiled.

       TFMFONTS
              Search path for font metric (.tfm) files.

FILES
       The location of the files mentioned below varies from system to system.  Use the kpsewhich  utility  to  find
       their locations.

       pdftex.pool
              Text file containing pdfTeX's internal strings.

       pdftex.map
              Filename mapping definitions.

       *.tfm  Metric files for pdfTeX's fonts.

       *.fmt  Predigested pdfTeX format (.fmt) files.

NOTES
       Starting  with  version 1.40, pdfTeX incorporates the e-TeX extensions, and pdfeTeX is just a copy of pdfTeX.
       See etex(1).  This manual page is not meant to be exhaustive.  The complete documentation for this version of
       pdfTeX can be found in the pdfTeX manual and the info manual Web2C: A TeX implementation.

BUGS
       This  version  of  pdfTeX implements a number of optional extensions.  In fact, many of these extensions con‐
       flict to a greater or lesser extent with the definition of pdfTeX.  When such  extensions  are  enabled,  the
       banner printed when pdfTeX starts is changed to print pdfTeXk instead of pdfTeX.

       This  version  of  pdfTeX  fails  to trap arithmetic overflow when dimensions are added or subtracted.  Cases
       where this occurs are rare, but when it does the generated DVI file will be invalid.  Whether a generated PDF
       file would be usable is unknown.

AVAILABILITY
       pdfTeX  is  available  for a large variety of machine architectures and operation systems.  pdfTeX is part of
       all major TeX distributions.

AUTHORS
       The primary authors of pdfTeX are Han The Thanh, Petr Sojka, Jiri Zlatuska, and Peter Breitenlohner (eTeX).

       TeX was designed by Donald E. Knuth, who implemented it using his Web system for  Pascal  programs.   It  was
       ported  to  Unix at Stanford by Howard Trickey, and at Cornell by Pavel Curtis.  The version now offered with
       the Unix TeX distribution is that generated by the Web to C  system  (web2c),  originally  written  by  Tomas
       Rokicki and Tim Morgan.

       The encTeX extensions were written by Petr Olsak.
