GNOME-SSH-ASKPASS(1)                           General Commands Manual                          GNOME-SSH-ASKPASS(1)



NAME
       gnome-ssh-askpass - prompts a user for a passphrase using GNOME

SYNOPSIS
       gnome-ssh-askpass

DESCRIPTION
       gnome-ssh-askpass  is  a  GNOME-based passphrase dialog for use with OpenSSH.  It is intended to be called by
       the ssh-add(1) program and not invoked directly.  It allows ssh-add(1) to obtain a passphrase  from  a  user,
       even if not connected to a terminal (assuming that an X display is available).  This happens automatically in
       the case where ssh-add is invoked from one's ~/.xsession or as one of the GNOME startup programs,  for  exam‐
       ple.

       In   order   to   be   called   automatically   by   ssh-add,   gnome-ssh-askpass   should  be  installed  as
       /usr/bin/ssh-askpass.

ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES
       The following environment variables are recognized:

       GNOME_SSH_ASKPASS_GRAB_SERVER
              Causes gnome-ssh-askpass to grab the X server before asking for a passphrase.

       GNOME_SSH_ASKPASS_GRAB_POINTER
              Causes gnome-ssh-askpass to grab the mouse  pointer  using  gdk_pointer_grab()  before  asking  for  a
              passphrase.

       Regardless  of whether either of these environment variables is set, gnome-ssh-askpass will grab the keyboard
       using gdk_keyboard_grab().
