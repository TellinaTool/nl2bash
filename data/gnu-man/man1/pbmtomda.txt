pbmtomda(1)                                    General Commands Manual                                   pbmtomda(1)



NAME
       pbmtomda - convert a portable bitmap to a Microdesign .mda

SYNOPSIS
       pbmtomda [-d][-i][--] [ pbmfile ]

DESCRIPTION
       Reads  a portable bitmap file as input.  Reads from stdin if input file is omitted.  Produces a MicroDesign 2
       area file (.MDA) as output.

OPTIONS
       -d     Halve the height of the output file, to compensate for the aspect ratio used in MicroDesign files.

       -i     Invert the colours used.

       --     End of options (use this if the filename starts with "-")

BUGS
       There's no way to produce files in MicroDesign 3 format. MD3 itself and mdatopbm(1) can read files in  either
       format.

SEE ALSO
       mdatopbm(1), pbm(5)
