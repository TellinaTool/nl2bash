NAME
       lshw - list hardware

SYNOPSIS
       lshw [ -version ]

       lshw [ -help ]

       lshw [ -X ]

       lshw  [  [ -html ]  [ -short ]  [ -xml ]  [ -json ]  [ -businfo ]  ]  [ -dump filename ]  [ -class class... ]
       [ -disable test... ]  [ -enable test... ]  [ -sanitize ]  [ -numeric ]  [ -quiet ]

DESCRIPTION
       lshw is a small tool to extract detailed information on the hardware configuration of  the  machine.  It  can
       report  exact  memory  configuration, firmware version, mainboard configuration, CPU version and speed, cache
       configuration, bus speed, etc. on DMI-capable x86 or IA-64 systems and on some PowerPC machines (PowerMac  G4
       is known to work).

       It  currently  supports  DMI  (x86  and  IA-64 only), OpenFirmware device tree (PowerPC only), PCI/AGP, CPUID
       (x86), IDE/ATA/ATAPI, PCMCIA (only tested on x86), SCSI and USB.

       -version
              Displays the version of lshw and exits.

       -help  Displays the available command line options and quits.

       -X     Launch the X11 GUI (if available).

       -html  Outputs the device tree as an HTML page.

       -xml   Outputs the device tree as an XML tree.

       -json  Outputs the device tree as a JSON object (JavaScript Object Notation).

       -short Outputs the device tree showing hardware paths, very much like the output of HP-UX's ioscan.

       -businfo
              Outputs the device list showing bus information, detailing SCSI, USB, IDE and PCI addresses.

       -dump filename
              Dump collected information into a file (SQLite database).

       -class class
              Only show the given class of hardware. class can be found using lshw -short or lshw -businfo.

       -C class
              Alias for -class class.

       -enable test

       -disable test
              Enables or disables a test. test can be dmi (for DMI/SMBIOS extensions), device-tree (for OpenFirmware
              device  tree),  spd (for memory Serial Presence Detect), memory (for memory-size guessing heuristics),
              cpuinfo (for kernel-reported CPU detection), cpuid (for CPU  detection),  pci  (for  PCI/AGP  access),
              isapnp  (for  ISA  PnP  extensions),  pcmcia  (for  PCMCIA/PCCARD),  ide (for IDE/ATAPI), usb (for USB
              devices),scsi (for SCSI) or network (for network interfaces detection).

       -quiet Don't display status.

       -sanitize
              Remove potentially sensitive information from output (IP addresses, serial numbers, etc.).

       -numeric
              Also display numeric IDs (for PCI and USB devices).

BUGS
       lshw currently does not detect Firewire(IEEE1394) devices.

       Not all architectures supported by GNU/Linux are fully supported (e.g.  CPU detection).

       "Virtual" SCSI interfaces used for SCSI emulation over IDE are not reported correctly yet.

NOTES
       lshw must be run as super user or it will only report partial information.

FILES
       /usr/local/share/pci.ids

       /usr/share/pci.ids

       /etc/pci.ids

       /usr/share/hwdata/pci.ids
              A list of all known PCI ID's (vendors, devices, classes and subclasses).

       /proc/bus/pci/*
              Used to access the configuration of installed PCI busses and devices.

       /proc/ide/*
              Used to access the configuration of installed IDE busses and devices.

       /proc/scsi/*, /dev/sg*
              Used to access the configuration of installed SCSI devices.

       /dev/cpu/*/cpuid
              Used on x86 platforms to access CPU-specific configuration.

       /proc/device-tree/*
              Used on PowerPC platforms to access OpenFirmware configuration.

       /proc/bus/usb/*
              Used to access the configuration of installed USB busses and devices.

       /sys/* Used on 2.6 kernels to access hardware/driver configuration information.

EXAMPLES
       lshw -short
              Lists hardware in a compact format.

       lshw -class disk -class storage
              Lists all disks and storage controllers in the system.

       lshw -html -class network
              Lists all network interfaces in HTML.

       lshw -disable dmi
              Don't use DMI to detect hardware.
