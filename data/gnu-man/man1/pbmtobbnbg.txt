NAME
       pbmtobbnbg - convert a portable bitmap into BitGraph graphics

SYNOPSIS
       pbmtobbnbg [rasterop] [x y] < pbmfile

DESCRIPTION
       Reads  a  portable bitmap as input.  Produces BBN BitGraph terminal Display Pixel Data (DPD) sequence as out‐
       put.

       The rasterop can be specified on the command line.  If this is omitted, 3 (replace) will be used.  A position
