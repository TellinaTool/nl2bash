LESSECHO(1)                                    General Commands Manual                                   LESSECHO(1)



NAME
       lessecho - expand metacharacters

SYNOPSIS
       lessecho [-ox] [-cx] [-pn] [-dn] [-mx] [-nn] [-ex] [-a] file ...

DESCRIPTION
       lessecho  is a program that simply echos its arguments on standard output.  But any metacharacter in the out‐
       put is preceded by an "escape" character, which by default is a backslash.

OPTIONS
       A summary of options is included below.

       -ex    Specifies "x", rather than backslash, to be the escape char for metachars.  If x  is  "-",  no  escape
              char is used and arguments containing metachars are surrounded by quotes instead.

       -ox    Specifies  "x",  rather  than  double-quote,  to be the open quote character, which is used if the -e-
              option is specified.

       -cx    Specifies "x" to be the close quote character.

       -pn    Specifies "n" to be the open quote character, as an integer.

       -dn    Specifies "n" to be the close quote character, as an integer.

       -mx    Specifies "x" to be a metachar.  By default, no characters are considered metachars.

       -nn    Specifies "n" to be a metachar, as an integer.

       -fn    Specifies "n" to be the escape char for metachars, as an integer.

       -a     Specifies that all arguments are to  be  quoted.   The  default  is  that  only  arguments  containing
              metacharacters are quoted
