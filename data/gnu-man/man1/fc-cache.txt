NAME
       fc-cache - build font information cache files

SYNOPSIS
       fc-cache  [  -frsvVh  ]   [ --force ]  [ --really-force ]  [ --system-only ]  [ --verbose ]  [ --version ]  [
       --help ]  [ dir... ]

DESCRIPTION
       fc-cache scans the font directories on the system and builds font information cache  files  for  applications
       using fontconfig for their font handling.

       If  directory  arguments  are not given, fc-cache uses each directory in the current font configuration. Each
       directory is scanned for font files readable by FreeType. A cache is created  which  contains  properties  of
       each  font  and  the  associated filename.  This cache is used to speed up application startup when using the
       fontconfig library.

       Note that fc-cache must be executed once per architecture to generate font information  customized  for  that
       architecture.

OPTIONS
       This  program  follows the usual GNU command line syntax, with long options starting with two dashes (`-'). A
       summary of options is included below.

       -f     Force re-generation of apparently up-to-date cache files, overriding the timestamp checking.

       -r     Erase all existing cache files and rescan.

       -s     Only scan system-wide directories, omitting the places located in the user's home directory.

       -v     Display status information while busy.

       -h     Show summary of options.

       -V     Show version of the program and exit.

       dir    Directory to scan for fonts.

FILES
       %cachdir%/*-%arch%.cache-2
              These files are generated by fc-cache and contain maps from file names to font  properties.  They  are
              read by the fontconfig library at application startup to locate appropriate fonts.
