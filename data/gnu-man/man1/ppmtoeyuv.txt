NAME
       ppmtoeyuv - convert a portable pixmap into a Berkeley YUV file

SYNOPSIS
       ppmtoeyuv [ppmfile]

DESCRIPTION
       Reads  a  portable pixmap as input.  Produces a Berkeley Encoder YUV (not the same as Abekas YUV) file on the
       Standard Output file.

       With no argument, takes input from Standard Input.  Otherwise, ppmfile is the file specification of the input
       file.

       ppmtoeyuv  handles multi-image PPM input streams, outputting consecutive eyuv images.  There must be at least
       one image, though.
