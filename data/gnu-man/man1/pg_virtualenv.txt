PG_VIRTUALENV(1)                          Debian PostgreSQL infrastructure                          PG_VIRTUALENV(1)



NAME
       pg_virtualenv - Create a throw-away PostgreSQL environment for running regression tests

SYNOPSIS
       pg_virtualenv [-ash -v 'version ...'] [command]

DESCRIPTION
       pg_virtualenv creates a virtual PostgreSQL server environment, and sets environment variables such that
       command can access the PostgreSQL database server(s). The servers are destroyed when command exits.

       The environment variables PGHOST, PGDATABASE, PGUSER, and PGPASSWORD will be set. Per default, a single new
       cluster is created on port 5432, using the newest PostgreSQL server version installed. When more clusters are
       created for other versions, they will use other port numbers.

       pg_createcluster is used to create the database clusters. The clusters are named version/regress. To access a
       cluster, set PGCLUSTER=version/regress. For ease of access, the clusters are also registered in
       /etc/postgresql-common/pg_service.conf, with the version number as cluster name. Clusters can be accessed by
       passing the connection string "service=version", e.g. psql service=9.2.

       When invoked as root user, the servers and command are run in an unshared mount and network namespace; the
       servers are created on tmpfses, so actions caused by command in the database do not affect the running
       system.  command can drop privileges as needed, provided the environment variables are passed.

       When invoked as non-root user, PG_CLUSTER_CONF_ROOT and PGSYSCONFDIR are set to a temporary directory where
       all files belonging to the clusters are created.

OPTIONS
       -a  Use all PostgreSQL server versions installed.

       -v version ...
           Use these versions (space-separated list).

       -c pg_createcluster options
           Extra options to pass to pg_createcluster.

       -i initdb options
           Extra initdb options to pass to pg_createcluster.

       -o guc=value
           Configuration option to set in the postgresql.conf file, passed to pg_createcluster.

       -s  Launch a shell inside the virtual environment when command fails.

       -h  Show program help.

EXAMPLE
         # pg_virtualenv make check

NOTES
       When run with fakeroot(1), pg_virtualenv will fall back to the non-root mode of operation. Running "fakeroot
       pg_virtualenv" as root will fail, though.
