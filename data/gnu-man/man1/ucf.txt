NAME
       ucf - Update Configuration File:  preserve user changes in configuration files

SYNOPSIS
       ucf [options] <New File> <Destination>

       ucf [options] --purge <Destination>

DESCRIPTION
       This utility provides a means of asking the user whether or not to accept new versions of configuration files
       provided by the package maintainer, with various heuristics designed to minimize interaction  time.  It  uses
       debconf  to  interact with the user, as per Debian policy.  In the SYNOPSIS above, New file is the configura‐
       tion file as provided by the package (either shipped with the package, or generated by the maintainer scripts
       on  the  fly),  and Destination is the location (usually under /etc) where the real configuration file lives,
       and is potentially modified by the end user.  As far as possible, ucf attempts to preserve the ownership  and
       permission of the New file as it is copied to the new location.

       This script attempts to provide conffile like handling for files installed under /etc not shipped in a Debian
       package, but handled by the postinst instead.  Debian policy states that files under /etc which are  configu‐
       ration  files  must  preserve  user changes, and this applies to files handled by maintainer scripts as well.
       Using ucf, one may ship a bunch of default configuration files somewhere in /usr ( /usr/share/<pkg> is a good
       location),  and  maintain  files in /etc, preserving user changes and in general offering the same facilities
       while upgrading that dpkg normally provides for “conffiles”

       Additionally, this script provides facilities for transitioning a file that had not  been  provided  conffile
       like  protection to come under this schema, and attempts to minimize questions asked at install time. Indeed,
       the transitioning facility is better than the one offered by dpkg while transitioning a file from a non-conf‐
       file  to conffile status. The second form in the SYNOPSIS above is for purging information about the configu‐
       ration file when the package is purged; and is critical for allowing smooth reinstallations.

       During the course of operations, when working with configuration files, ucf optionally creates copies of ver‐
       sions  of  the configuration file in question. For example, a file with the suffix ucf-old holds the old ver‐
       sion of a configuration file replaced by ucf.  Also, copies of the configuration file with the suffixes  ucf-
       new  and ucf-dist may be created; and the maintainer scripts should consider purging copies of the configura‐
       tion file with these extensions during purge.

OPTIONS
       -h, --help
              Print a short usage message

       -n, --no-action
              Dry run. Print the actions that would be taken if the script is invoked, but take no action.

       -d [n], --debug [n]
              Set the debug level to the (optional) level n (n defaults to  1).  This  turns  on  copious  debugging
              information.

       -p, --purge
              Removes  all  vestiges  of the file from the state hashfile. This is required to allow a package to be
              reinstalled after it is purged; since otherwise, the  real  configuration  file  is  removed,  but  it
              remains  in  the  hash  file;  and  on  reinstall no action is taken, since the md5sum of the new file
              matches that in the hashfile.  In short, remember to use this option in the postrm for every  configu‐
              ration  file  managed by ucf when the package is being purged (assuming ucf itself exists).  Note: ucf
              does not actually touch the file on disk in this operation, so any file removals are still the respon‐
              sibility of the calling package.

       -v, --verbose
              Make the script be very verbose about setting internal variables.

       -s foo, --src-dir  foo
              Set the source directory (historical md5sums are expected to live in files and sub directories of this
              directory) to foo. By default, the directory the new_file lives in is assumed to be the source  direc‐
              tory.  Setting  this  option overrides settings in the environment variable UCF_SOURCE_DIR, and in the
              configuration  file variable conf_source_dir.

       --sum-file  foo
              Force the historical md5sums to be read from this file, rather than defaulting to living in the source
              directory.  Setting this option overrides settings in the environment variable UCF_OLD_MDSUM_FILE, and
              in the  configuration  file variable conf_old_mdsum_file.

       --three-way
              This turns on the option, during installation, for the user to be offered a chance to see a  merge  of
              the  changes  between old maintainer version and the new maintainer version into the local copy of the
              configuration file. If the user likes what they see, they can ask to have  these  changes  merged  in.
              This  allows one to get new upstream changes merged in even while retaining local modifications to the
              configuration file. This is accomplished by taking the configuration file and stashing it in  a  cache
              area  during  registration, and using diff3 during the install (the stashed file name is a munged ver‐
              sion of the full path of the configuration file to  avoid  name  space  clashes).   Note  This  option
              appeared  in  Version  0.8  of  ucf, which was the first version released into unstable and ultimately
              Sarge.  The version of ucf in woody does not contain this option.

       --debconf-ok
              Indicate that it is ok for ucf to use an already running debconf instance for prompting (it has always
              been  ok  to use ucf when debconf is not running -- it shall invoke debconf as needed). Since histori‐
              cally maintainer scripts that used debconf and also ucf had to disable/cripple debconf before  running
              ucf  (since  ucf  did  not prompt with debconf, and needed stdio available), ucf must be cautious when
              called from a maintainer script that uses debconf. This option lets it know that the maintainer script
              has  not  told  debconf  to stop, or redirected its stdio from debconf, or anything of the sort -- and
              thus it is safe to use debconf even when the script discovers that debconf is running.  Packages  that
              call  ucf  with  this option should take care to depend on version 0.28 or higher of ucf (the first to
              support use this option).

       --debconf-template  foo
              Instruct ucf to use the named multiselect debconf template instead of the normal ucf-provided  debconf
              template.   The  caller  is  responsible for ensuring that the named template exists and has a list of
              choices matching those for the default ucf template, and should set Choices-C:  ${CHOICES}  to  ensure
              the  returned  values  match those from the default template.  Note that the choices must be different
              according to whether the --three-way option is also set.

       --state-dir /path/to/dir
              Set the state directory to /path/to/dir instead of the default /var/lib/ucf.  Used mostly for testing.

USAGE
       The most common case usage is pretty simple: a single line invocation  in  the  postinst  on  configure,  and
       another  single  line  in  the  postrm to tell ucf to forget about the configuration file on purge (using the
       --purge option) is all that is needed (assuming ucf is still on the system).

       It is recommended that you also register any file being managed by ucf with the ucf registry; this associates
       the  configuration  file  with the package it belongs to. This is done with a simple call to ucfr.  Users may
       then query the association between a configuration file and the package using the tool ucfq.  Please see  the
       appropriate manual pages for details.

       If a file maintained by maintainer scripts is being transitioned from an unprotected status to the protection
       afforded by the script, the maintainer can help ease the transition by reducing the  questions  that  may  be
       asked at installation time. Specifically, questions should not be asked if the file in question is an unmodi‐
       fied version that was one shipped in a previous version of this package;  and  the  maintainer  can  help  by
       telling the script about the historical md5sums that published versions of this file contained.

       The  way  to  do this is to either create a file called <New file>.md5sum, with one md5sum on each line, (the
       file names you use are ignored, except for the entry named default),  or  create  a  directory,  called  <New
       file>.md5sum.d,  which  should contain any number of files, each containing a single line, namely, the md5sum
       of a previous version of <New file>.  The names of these files are not important,  with  one  exception:  The
       file  called  default  is  treated specially.  For example, the author personally uses either package version
       numbers or release code names, like 7.6.3, or potato.  If none of the historical md5sums match, we are almost
       certain  that either the historical record of md5sums is not complete, or the user has changed the configura‐
       tion file.

   The default historical md5sum
       The exception to the rule about names mentioned earlier is that if no md5sums match, and  if  the  file  <New
       file>.md5sum.d/default exists, or if there is a line corresponding to a default file in <New file>.md5sum, it
       shall be used as the default md5sum of the previous version of the package assumed to have been installed  on
       this  machine.   As  you  can see, unless there are limited number of previously released packages (like just
       one), the maintainer is also making an informed guess, but the option is provided to the maintainer.

       If the file <New file>.md5sum, or the directory <New file>.md5sum.d does not exist, or none  of  the  md5sums
       match,  we test the installed <Destination> file to see whether it is the same as the <New file>.  If not, we
       ask the user whether they want us to replace the file.

       An additional facility is also offered: optionally, ucf can store one old version of the maintainers copy  of
       the configuration file, and, on upgrade, calculate the changes made in the maintainers version of the config‐
       uration file, and apply that patch to the local version of the file (on user request, of  course).  There  is
       also  a  preview facility where the user can inspect the results of such a merge, before asking the action to
       be taken.

ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES
       The variable UCF_FORCE_CONFFNEW, if set, forces the new file to always overwrite  the  installed  destination
       file, while the variable UCF_FORCE_CONFFOLD, if set silently retains the installed file.  UCF_FORCE_CONFFMISS
       is only applicable when the installed destination file does not  exist  (perhaps  due  to  user  removal),and
       forces  ucf to recreate the missing file (the default behaviour is to honor the users wishes and not recreate
       the locally deleted file).

FILES
       This script creates the file new_file.md5sum, and it may copy the file (presumably shipped with the  package)
       <New file> to its destination, <Destination>.

       /var/lib/ucf/hashfile,  and  /var/lib/ucf/hashfile.X,  where X is a small integer, where previous versions of
       the hashfile are stored.

       /etc/ucf.conf

EXAMPLES
       If the package foo wants to use ucf to handle user interaction for configuration file foo.conf, a version  of
       which is provided in the package as /usr/share/foo/configuration, a simple invocation of ucf in the post inst
       file is all that is needed:

       ucf /usr/share/foo/configuration /etc/foo.conf

       On purge, one should tell ucf to forget about the file (see  detailed  examples  in  /usr/share/doc/ucf/exam‐
       ples):

       ucf --purge /etc/foo.conf

       The  motivation for this script was to provide conffile like handling for start files for emacs lisp packages
       (for example, /etc/emacs21/site-start.d/50psgml-init.el ) These start files are not shipped with the package,
       instead,  they  are  installed  during the post installation configuration phase by the script /usr/lib/emac‐
       sen-common/emacs-package-install $package_name.

       This script is  meant  to  be  invoked  by  the  packages  install  script  at  /usr/lib/emacsen-common/pack‐
       ages/install/$package_name  for each flavour of installed emacsen by calling it with the proper values of new
       file      (      /usr/share/emacs/site-lisp/<pkg>/<pkg-init.el      ),      and       dest       file       (
       /etc/emacs21/site-start.d/50<pkg-init.el ), and it should do the rest.
