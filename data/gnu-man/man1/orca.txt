NAME
       orca - a scriptable screen reader

SYNOPSIS
       orca [option...]

DESCRIPTION
       orca  is a screen reader for people with visual impairments, it provides alternative access to the desktop by
       using speech synthesis and braille.

       orca works with applications and toolkits that support the Assistive Technology  Service  Provider  Interface
       (AT-SPI),  which  is  the primary assistive technology infrastructure for Linux and Solaris. Applications and
       toolkits supporting the AT-SPI include the GNOME Gtk+ toolkit, the Java platform's  Swing  toolkit,  LibreOf‐
       fice, Gecko, and WebKitGtk. AT-SPI support for the KDE Qt toolkit is being pursued.

OPTIONS
       -t, --text-setup
              When starting orca, initiate the text-based configuration.

       -u, --user-prefs-dir=dirname
              When starting orca, use dirname as an alternate directory for the user preferences.

       -e, --enable=speech|braille|braille-monitor
              When starting orca, force the enabling of the supplied options.

       -d, --disable=speech|braille|braille-monitor
              When starting orca, force the disabling of the supplied options.

       -l, --list-apps
              Prints the names of all the currently running applications.  This is used primarily for debugging pur‐
              poses to see if orca can talk to the accessibility infrastructure.  Note that if orca is already  run‐
              ning,  this  will  not  kill the other orca process.  It will just list the currently running applica‐
              tions, and you will see orca listed twice: once for the existing orca and once for this instance.

       --debug
              Enables debug output for orca and sends all debug output to a file with a name  of  the  form  'debug-
              YYYY-MM-DD-HH:MM:SS.out'  in  the current directory.  The YYYY-MM-DD-HH:MM:SS portion will be replaced
              with the current date and time.

       --debug-file=filename
              Enables debug output for orca and sends all debug output to the given filename.

       -v, --version
              outputs orca version number and exits.

       -h, --help
              displays orca help and exits.

       --replace
              Replace a currently running orca process.  By default, if orca detects an existing  orca  process  for
              the  same  session, it will not start a new orca process.  This option will kill and cleanup after any
              existing orca process and then start a new orca in its place.



       KEYBOARD SETTINGS
              Orca provides two keyboard modes, Desktop and Laptop keyboard layout. The Orca_Modifier key is  Insert
              in desktop keyboard layout and Caps_Lock in laptop keyboard layout.

              Orca  uses default GNOME keyboard shortcuts to navigate the desktop and interact with various applica‐
              tions. The flat review commands provide an alternative method of interaction in  certain  inaccessible
