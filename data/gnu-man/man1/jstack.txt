NAME
       jstack - Prints Java thread stack traces for a Java process, core file, or remote debug server. This command
       is experimental and unsupported.

SYNOPSIS
       jstack [ options ] pid

       jstack [ options ] executable core

       jstack [ options ] [ server-id@ ] remote-hostname-or-IP


       options
              The command-line options. See Options.

       pid    The process ID for which the stack trace is printed. The process must be a Java process. To get a list
              of Java processes running on a machine, use the jps(1) command.

       executable
              The Java executable from which the core dump was produced.

       core   The core file for which the stack trace is to be printed.

       remote-hostname-or-IP
              The remote debug server hostname or IP address. See jsadebugd(1).

       server-id
              An optional unique ID to use when multiple debug servers are running on the same remote host.

DESCRIPTION
       The jstack command prints Java stack traces of Java threads for a specified Java process, core file, or
       remote debug server. For each Java frame, the full class name, method name, byte code index (BCI), and line
       number, when available, are printed. With the -m option, the jstack command prints both Java and native
       frames of all threads with the program counter (PC). For each native frame, the closest native symbol to PC,
       when available, is printed. C++ mangled names are not demangled. To demangle C++ names, the output of this
       command can be piped to c++filt. When the specified process is running on a 64-bit Java Virtual Machine, you
       might need to specify the -J-d64 option, for example: jstack -J-d64 -m pid.

       Note: This utility is unsupported and might not be available in future release of the JDK. In Windows Systems
       where the dbgeng.dll file is not present, Debugging Tools For Windows must be installed so these tools work.
       The PATH environment variable needs to contain the location of the jvm.dll that is used by the target
       process, or the location from which the crash dump file was produced. For example:

       set PATH=<jdk>\jre\bin\client;%PATH%


OPTIONS
       -F
              Force a stack dump when jstack [-l] pid does not respond.

       -l
              Long listing. Prints additional information about locks such as a list of owned java.util.concurrent
              ownable synchronizers. See the AbstractOwnableSynchronizer class description at
              http://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/util/concurrent/locks/AbstractOwnableSynchronizer.html

       -m
              Prints a mixed mode stack trace that has both Java and native C/C++ frames.

       -h
              Prints a help message.

       -help
              Prints a help message.

KNOWN BUGS
       In mixed mode stack trace, the -m option does not work with the remote debug server.
