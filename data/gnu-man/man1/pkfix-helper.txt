NAME
       pkfix-helper - preprocess dvips-produced PostScript documents before passing them to pkfix

SYNOPSIS
       pkfix-helper [--help] [--verbose] [--force=name=fontspec] [--ps=filename.ps] [--tex=filename.tex]
       [--cache=filename] [--include=fontspec] [--exclude=regexp] [--keep=fontspec] [--quiet] [--no-repeats]
       [--spp=number] [input.ps [output.ps]]

DESCRIPTION
   Motivation
       PostScript documents created with old versions of dvips almost invariably utilize bitmapped (PostScript
       Type 3) fonts.  The problem with bitmapped fonts is that they target a specific device resolution; a
       PostScript file produced using 300 DPI fonts will look grainy on a 600 DPI printer.  Even worse, all
       bitmapped fonts look grainy when zoomed in on screen.  The solution is to use vector (PostScript Type 1)
       fonts, which are resolution-independent and appear crisp at any size or scale.

       While it is no longer difficult to configure dvips to use vector fonts, it is not always possible to rerun
       dvips on an old .dvi file.  The .dvi file and document source may have been lost; or, the source may no
       longer compile because packages it depends upon may no longer be available.

       Heiko Oberdiek's pkfix script replaces bitmapped fonts in dvips-produced PostScript files with the
       corresponding vector fonts.  It works by parsing the PostScript comments with which dvips surrounds
       bitmapped-font definitions.  For example, a font definition beginning with the comment "%DVIPSBitmapFont: Fi
       cmss10 11 28" and ending with a matching %EndDVIPSBitmapFont is known to define font "Fi" as "cmss10"
       (Computer Modern Sans Serif at a design size of 10 points) scaled to 11 points.  Only the 28 characters
       actually used by the document are defined.  pkfix then replaces the font definition with one that defines
       "Fi" using the same set of characters but taken from the cmss10.pfb vector font file.

       Unfortunately, pkfix works only with versions of dvips newer than v5.58 (ca. 1996).  Naturally, the older a
       PostScript document, the less likely its sources still exist and can still be recompiled.  Older versions of
       dvips lack %DVIPSBitmapFont comments and various other PostScript comments on which pkfix relies.  Without
       PostScript comments to guide it, pkfix is unable to determine which vector fonts correspond with which
       bitmapped fonts.

   Overview
       The pkfix-helper script is a preprocessor for pkfix that attempts to determine the association between each
       document-font name (e.g., "Fi") in a PostScript file and the original font (e.g., "cmss10") and fonts size
       (e.g., 11 points).  It then fabricates the PostScript comments that pkfix expects to see so that pkfix can do
       its job.

       pkfix-helper works by comparing every document font against every .tfm font file it knows about (assuming
       that each such font has a corresponding .pfb vector version) and selecting the best matching .tfm file for
       every document font.  pkfix-helper has access only to the widths of characters and only to those characters
       actually used in the document.  Also, the program recognizes only a limited set of the most popular .tfm
       files and scaling factors.  Consequently, the comparison is imperfect and pkfix-helper may attribute an
       incorrect font to a given name.  Fonts comprising only one or two characters actually used in a document are
       particularly problematic for pkfix-helper because many fonts may be near-enough matches to fool the problem.

       pkfix-helper is designed so that a user can guide the font-selection process by manually designating matching
       fonts.  With a modicum of diligence and patience a user can correct any mismatched fonts and help the program
       provide proper input to pkfix.

OPTIONS
       pkfix-helper accepts on the command line the filename of a PostScript document to process (with the default
       being the standard input device) and the filename of a modified PostScript document to create (with the
       default being the standard output device).  The program also accepts the following command-line options:

   Frequently Used Options
       -h, --help
           Display usage information and exit.  The --verbose and --quiet options can be used to increase and
           decrease the amount of information presented.

       -v, --verbose
           Increase the amount of status information that pkfix-helper displays as it runs.  Additional instances of
           --verbose on the command line further increase the program's verbosity.  By default, only major
           operations are displayed.  A single --verbose additionally displays information about individual font
           comparisons.  A second --verbose additionally displays details about some of the program's internal
           operations.

       -f name=fontspec, --force=name=fontspec
           Force pkfix-helper to associate a specific font with a given font name appearing the document.  name is a
           two-character dvips font name such as "Fa".  fontspec is a font specification such as "cmmi8" or
           "cmsy10 @ 1.1X".  An asterisk used in the name of the base font (e.g., "cmti*") will automatically try
           all integral test font sizes from 5 to 17 points ("cmti5", "cmti6", ..., "cmti17").  An asterisk used as
           a scale value (e.g., "cmsy10 @ *") will be replaced by the scale value that gives the best match to the
           original font's metrics.  The --force option can be specified repeatedly on the command line.

       -p filename.ps, --ps=filename.ps
           Create a PostScript file called filename.ps that shows the dvips name and a font sample of every font
           used by the input document.

       -t filename.tex, --tex=filename.tex
           Create a Plain TeX file called filename.tex that shows the dvips name and a font sample of every font
           that pkfix-helper used in the output document.

   Infrequently Used Options
       -C filename, --cache=filename
           Speed up TFM file processing by caching character metrics into file filename.  On some systems it takes a
           long time to read a TFM file, spawn tftopl to convert it to PL format, and extract from the PL data the
           metrics for each character.  The first time --cache is specified, pkfix-helper proceeds as normal then
           writes all of the extracted character metrics to filename.  On subsequent runs in which --cache=filename
           is specified, pkfix-helper reads the previously extracted metrics from filename, going through the
           tftopl-based process only for TFM files that were not previously encountered.

       -q, --quiet
           Instruct pkfix-helper to produce no output during its run except for fatal error messages.

       -1, --no-repeats
           Prevent pkfix-helper from associating the same fontspec with more than one dvips font name.

       -i fontspec, --include=fontspec
           Add fontspec to the list of font specifications against which pkfix-helper compares every document font.
           (In contrast, --force designates a font specification to use only for a specific document font.)  The
           --include option can be specified repeatedly on the command line.

       -x regexp, --exclude=regexp
           Remove all font specifications matching regular expression regexp from pkfix-helper's list of known
           fonts.  The --exclude option can be specified repeatedly on the command line.

       -k fontspec, --keep=fontspec
           Do not substitute a vector font for bitmapped font fontspec ("Fa", "Fb", etc.).  This is useful when
           converting documents that use obscure bitmapped fonts for which there is no vector equivalent.  For
           example, it was somewhat common in the past to include graphics such as university or corporate logos
           into a document by converting the bitmapped image into a single-character font and using that font in
           LaTeX.  --keep prevents such fonts from being replaced.  The --keep option can be specified repeatedly on
           the command line.

       -a, --any-scale
           Allow any value to be used to scale a font when ""*"" is specified as the scale factor.  Normally, pkfix-
           helper considers only integer multiples of 0.1 that are greater than or equal to 1.0 (i.e., fontname@1X,
           "@1.1X", "@1.2X", "@1.3X", etc.).

       -s, --spp
           Specify the number of font samples per page to print to the files indicated using the --ps and --tex
           options.  The default value, 25, should work well in most circumstances.

DIAGNOSTICS
       "Best match for name is rather poor"
           The best font pkfix-helper found for dvips font name name has a mismatch value greater than or equal
           to 1.0.  (The mismatch value is the sum of the squares of the difference between the character widths of
           a document font and a potential replacement font.)  Use the --force option to designate an alternative
           replacement font or scaling amount.

EXAMPLES
       For the purpose of the following examples, assume that oldfile.ps is the name of a PostScript file produced
       by an old version of dvips and utilizing at least one bitmapped font.  It's always worth verifying that pkfix
       can't convert the file on its own:

           $ pkfix oldfile.ps newfile.ps
           PKFIX 1.3, 2005/02/25 - Copyright (c) 2001, 2005 by Heiko Oberdiek.
           ==> no fonts converted

       (Alternatively pkfix may issue an error message such as "!!!  Error: Parse error (@start parameters)!".)
       Only when pkfix can't replace bitmapped fonts with vector fonts is pkfix-helper needed.  In its simplest
       form, pkfix-helper takes the name of an input file (oldfile.ps in this example) and the name of an output
       file (pkfix-oldfile.ps), which will have the same contents as the input file but serve as suitable input for
       pkfix:

           $ pkfix-helper oldfile.ps pkfix-oldfile.ps
           Reading oldfile.ps ... done.

       Although pkfix-helper tries to automate as much as possible the font-detection process, some fonts will
       invariably be incorrectly identified.  The program outputs a warning message if it knows a match is bad but
       the lack of a warning message does not necessarily indicate that pkfix-helper did a good job.  It is
       therefore strongly recommended that the user produce "before" and "after" font sheets:

           $ pkfix-helper -q oldfile.ps pkfix-oldfile.ps \
             --ps=oldfonts.ps --tex=newfonts.tex

           $ tex newfonts.tex

       After running the preceding commands, oldfonts.ps shows samples of the fonts in oldfile.ps and newfonts.ps
       shows samples of the replacement fonts that pkfix-helper used to produce pkfix-oldfile.ps.  Print oldfonts.ps
       and newfonts.ps and compare them carefully for incorrect fonts and sizes.

       Suppose that the choice of "cmbx12 @ 1.2X" for font "Ff" looks wrong; say the characters look taller in
       oldfonts.ps than in newfonts.ps.  This is where the trial-and-error stage begins.  Let's hypothesize that
       "cmb12" is a better match than "cmbx12" but we don't know how much to scale the font.  Fortunately, pkfix-
       helper allows "*" to be used as a scaling factor to tell the program to automatically detect an optimal
       scaling factor, even if doing so means choosing a nonstandard font size:

           $ pkfix-helper oldfile.ps pkfix-oldfile.ps --force="Ff=cmb12 @ *"
           Reading oldfile.ps ... done.
           Number of Type 3 fonts encountered: 10
           Bitmapped fonts are typeset at 600 DPI.
           Finding character widths ... done.
           Reading TFM files ... failed.
           pkfix-helper: Unable to process user-specified TFM file "cmb12"

       Oops, it looks like we don't have a cmb12.tfm file on our system.  Let's try scaling up cmb10.tfm instead:

           $ pkfix-helper oldfile.ps pkfix-oldfile.ps --force="Ff=cmb10 @ *"
           Reading oldfile.ps ... done.
           Number of Type 3 fonts encountered: 10
           Bitmapped fonts are typeset at 600 DPI.
           Finding character widths ... done.
           Reading TFM files ... done (103 TFMs in 193 scaling variations).
           Matching fonts:
               Processing Fi ... done (cmr10 @ 1X, mismatch=0.11683).
               Processing Fa ... done (cmti10 @ 1X, mismatch=0.08892).
               Processing Fb ... done (cmr8 @ 1X, mismatch=0.07133).
               Processing Ff ... done (cmb10 @ 1.5X, mismatch=0.00035).
               Processing Fh ... done (cmtt10 @ 1X, mismatch=0.06895).
               Processing Fd ... done (cmmi10 @ 1X, mismatch=0.03966).
               Processing Fj ... done (cmbx12 @ 1X, mismatch=0.03972).
               Processing Fe ... done (cmbx10 @ 1X, mismatch=0.00762).
               Processing Fg ... done (cmsy10 @ 1X, mismatch=0.00875).
               Processing Fc ... done (cmr6 @ 1X, mismatch=0.00284).

       The match has definitely improved, although 15 pt. is certainly an odd size for a font.  Then again, many
       documents do use nonstandard sizes so this may in fact be correct.  The best way to verify is once again to
       produce, print, and compare a pair of font samples and iterate until all of the fonts look correct.  Use one
       instance of --force for each font you want to alter.

ENVIRONMENT
       pkfix-helper honors the following environment variables:

       GS      The name of the Ghostscript interpreter (default: gs)

       TFTOPL  The name of a utility for converting .tfm files to .pl files (default: tftopl)

BUGS
       Even when pkfix-helper finds a perfect match (i.e., the correct font in the correct size) the mismatch value
       is still typically nonzero.  The same error is probably what causes pkfix-helper sometimes to consider the
       wrong font as being a better match than the correct font.  Suggestions for fixing these bugs are welcome.

RESTRICTIONS
       pkfix-helper works only with PostScript files produced by dvips, not with arbitrary PostScript files.  The
       program has not been tested with output from versions of dvips older than v5.490 (ca. 1992); output from
       older versions may or may not work.  Only bitmapped fonts loaded by dvips can be analyzed, not bitmapped
       fonts loaded by embedded graphics.

       pkfix-helper works by comparing character widths, not the actual glyphs.  Consequently, it is misled by sets
       of fonts with similar character widths (at least for those characters used by a given document).  As an
       extreme example, all Computer Modern Teletype fonts of a given design size (e.g., "cmtt10", "cmsltt10", and
       "cmitt10") use exactly the same widths for all characters.  Human assistance is generally needed to guide
       pkfix-helper's font-matching procedures.

NOTES
       Files produced using the --tex option are Plain TeX files and therefore must be compiled with tex (or a
       variation such as pdftex, luatex, etc.), not with latex.
