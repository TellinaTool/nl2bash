NAME
       pgmtolispm - convert a portable graymap into Lisp Machine format

SYNOPSIS
       pgmtolispm [pgmfile]

DESCRIPTION
       Reads a portable graymap as input.  Produces a Lisp Machine bitmap as output.

       This  is  the  file  format  read  by  the  tv:read-bit-array-file function on TI Explorer and Symbolics lisp
       machines.

       Given a pgm (instead of a pbm) a multi-plane image will be output.  This is probably not  useful  unless  you
       have a color lisp machine.

       Multi-plane bitmaps on lisp machines are color; but the lispm image file format does not include a color map,
       so we must treat it as a graymap instead.  This is unfortunate.

SEE ALSO
       lispmtopgm(1), pgm(5)

BUGS
       Output width is always rounded up to the nearest multiple of 32; this might not always be what you want,  but
       it probably is (arrays which are not modulo 32 cannot be passed to the Lispm BITBLT function, and thus cannot
       easily be displayed on the screen).

       No color.
