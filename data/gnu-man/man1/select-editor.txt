NAME
       select-editor - select your default sensible-editor from all installed editors

SYNOPSIS
       select-editor

DESCRIPTION
       select-editor  provides  a coherent mechanism for selecting and storing a preferred sensible-editor on a per-
       user basis.  It lists the available editors on a system and interactively prompts the  user  to  select  one.
       The  results  are stored as SELECTED_EDITOR in ~/.selected_editor, which is sourced and used by sensible-edi‐
       tor.  SELECTED_EDITOR is overridden by the VISUAL and EDITOR environment variables.
