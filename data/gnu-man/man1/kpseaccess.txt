KPSEACCESS(1)                                  General Commands Manual                                 KPSEACCESS(1)



NAME
       kpseaccess - determine whether a file can be accessed

SYNOPSIS
       kpseaccess mode file

DESCRIPTION
       Exit  successfully  if file can be accessed with the specified mode.  The mode is an optional dash (`-') fol‐
       lowed by zero or more letters of rwx, where r is for readable, w is for writable, and x is for executable.

       The difference between kpseaccess and test is that the latter looks at the permission bits, while the  former
       checks  using  the  access(2) system call.  This makes a difference when file systems have been mounted read-
       only.

OPTIONS
       kpseaccess accepts the following options:

       --help Print help message and exit.

       --version
              Print version information and exit.

SEE ALSO
