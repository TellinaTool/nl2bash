SOELIM(1)                                      General Commands Manual                                     SOELIM(1)



NAME
       soelim - interpret .so requests in groff input

SYNOPSIS
       soelim [-Crtv] [-I dir] [files ...]

       It is possible to have whitespace between the -I command line option and its parameter.

DESCRIPTION
       soelim reads files and replaces lines of the form

              .so file

       by  the contents of file.  It is useful if files included with .so need to be preprocessed.  Normally, soelim
       should be invoked with the -s option of groff.

       To embed `\' in the file name, write `\\' or `\e'.  To embed a space, write `\ '.  Any other escape  sequence
       in file makes soelim ignore the whole line.

       Note that there must be no whitespace between the leading dot and the two characters `s' and `o'.  Otherwise,
       only groff interprets the .so request (and soelim ignores it).

OPTIONS
       -C     Recognize .so even when followed by a character other than space or newline.

       -Idir  This option may be used to add a directory to the search path for files (both  those  on  the  command
              line  and  those  named  in .so requests).  The search path is initialized with the current directory.
              This option may be specified more than once; the directories are then searched in the order  specified
              (but  before  the  current directory).  If you want to make the current directory be read before other
              directories, add -I. at the appropriate place.

              No directory search is performed for files with an absolute file name.

       -r     Do not add .lf requests (for general use, with non-groff files).

       -t     Don't emit .lf requests but TeX comment lines (starting with `%') giving the  current  file  and  line
              number.

       -v     Print the version number.

USAGE
       The normal processing sequence of groff is this:

                 input        sourced
                 file          file
                   |             |
                   v             v
               preprocessor -> troff -> postprocessor
                                             |
                                             v
                                          output
                                           file

       That  is,  files  sourced  with  .so  are  normally read only by troff (the actual formatter).  soelim is not
       required for troff to source files.

       If a file to be sourced should also be preprocessed, it must already be read before  the  input  file  passes
       through the preprocessor.  This is handled by soelim:

                 input
                 file
                   |
                   v
                 soelim -> preprocessor -> troff -> postprocessor
                   ^                                     |
                   |                                     v
                sourced                               output
                 file                                  file
