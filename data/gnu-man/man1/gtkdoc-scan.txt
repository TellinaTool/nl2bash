gtkdoc-scan(1)                                 General Commands Manual                                gtkdoc-scan(1)



NAME
       gtkdoc-scan —  Extracts declarations of functions, macros, enums, structs and unions from header files.

SYNOPSIS
       gtkdoc-scan  [ MODULE name ]  [ source directory (optional) ]  [ output directory (optional) ]  [ header file
       ]

DESCRIPTION
       gtkdoc-scan Extracts declarations of functions, macros, enums, structs and unions from header files.

       It is called with a module name, an optional source directory, an optional output directory, and  the  header
       files to scan.

       It  outputs  all  declarations found to a file named MODULE-decl.txt, and the list of declarations to another
       file MODULE-decl-list.txt

       This second list file is typically copied to SGML pages.

       This binary must be used inside a Makefile and not directly in a command line. See section EXAMPLE.

EXAMPLE
       See /usr/share/doc/gtk-doc-tools/examples, for a makefile.am and a configure.in example file.
