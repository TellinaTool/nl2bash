NAME
       pbmtext - render text into a bitmap

SYNOPSIS
       pbmtext [-font fontfile] [-builtin fontname] [-space pixels] [-lspace pixels] [text]


DESCRIPTION
       Takes  the  specified text, either a single line from the command line or multiple lines from standard input,
       and renders it into a bitmap.

       In the bitmap, each line of input is a line of output.  Formatting characters such as newline have no  effect
       on the formatting; like any unprintable character, they turn into spaces.

       The  bitmap  is  just wide enough for the longest line of text, plus margins, and just high enough to contain
       the lines of text, plus margins.  The left and right margins are twice the width of the widest  character  in
       the font; the top and bottom margins are the height of the tallest character in the font.  But if the text is
       only one line, all the margins are half of this.


OPTIONS
       -font,-builtin
              By default, pbmtext uses a built-in font called bdf (about a 10 point Times-Roman font).  You can  use
              a fixed width font by specifying -builtin fixed.

              You  can also specify your own font with the -font flag.  The fontfile is either a BDF file from the X
              window system or a PBM file.

              If the fontfile is a PBM file, it is created in a very specific way.  In your window system of choice,
              display the following text in the desired (fixed-width) font:

                  M ",/^_[`jpqy| M

                  /  !"#$%&'()*+ /
                  < ,-./01234567 <
                  > 89:;<=>?@ABC >
                  @ DEFGHIJKLMNO @
                  _ PQRSTUVWXYZ[ _
                  { \]^_`abcdefg {
                  } hijklmnopqrs }
                  ~ tuvwxyz{|}~  ~

                  M ",/^_[`jpqy| M

              Do a screen grab or window dump of that text, using for instance xwd, xgrabsc, or screendump.  Convert
              the result into a pbm file.  If necessary, use pnmcut to remove everything except the text.   Finally,
              run  it  through pnmcrop to make sure the edges are right up against the text.  pbmtext can figure out
              the sizes and spacings from that.


       -space pixels
              Add pixels pixels of space between characters.  This is in  addition  to  whatever  space  surrounding
              characters is built into the font, which is usually enough to produce a reasonable string of text.

              pixels may be negative to crowd text together, but the author has not put much thought or testing into
              how this works in every possible case, so it might cause disastrous results.


       -B -lspace pixels
              Add pixels pixels of space between lines. This is in addition to whatever space above and below  char‐
              acters is built into the font, which is usually enough to produce a reasonable line spacing.

              pixels must be a whole number.

              pixels  may  be  negative  to crowd lines together, but the author has not put much thought or testing
              into how this works in every possible case, so it might cause disastrous results.



USAGE
       Often, you want to place text over another image.  One way to do this is with ppmlabel.   ppmlabel  does  not
       give you the font options that pbmtext does, though.

       Another  way  is  to use pbmtext to create an image containing the text, then use pnmcomp to overlay the text
       image onto your base image.  To make only the text (and not the entire rectangle  containing  it)  cover  the
       base  image,  you  will  need to give pnmcomp a mask, via its -alpha option.  You can just use the text image
       itself as the mask, as long as you also specify the -invert option to pnmcomp.

       If you want to overlay colored text instead of black, just use ppmchange to change all black  pixels  to  the
       color  of your choice before overlaying the text image.  But still use the original black and white image for
       the alpha mask.

       If you want the text at an angle, use pnmrotate on the text image (and alpha mask) before overlaying.
