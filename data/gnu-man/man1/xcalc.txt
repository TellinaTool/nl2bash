NAME
       xcalc - scientific calculator for X

SYNOPSIS
       xcalc [-stipple] [-rpn] [-toolkitoption...]

DESCRIPTION
       xcalc is a scientific calculator desktop accessory that can emulate a TI-30 or an HP-10C.

OPTIONS
       xcalc accepts all of the standard toolkit command line options along with two additional options:

       -stipple
               This  option  indicates  that the background of the calculator should be drawn using a stipple of the
               foreground and background colors.  On monochrome displays improves the appearance.

       -rpn    This option indicates that Reverse Polish Notation should be used.  In this mode the calculator  will
               look and behave like an HP-10C.  Without this flag, it will emulate a TI-30.

OPERATION
       Pointer  Usage: Operations may be performed with pointer button 1, or in some cases, with the keyboard.  Many
       common calculator operations have keyboard accelerators.  To quit, press pointer button 3 on the  AC  key  of
       the TI calculator, or the ON key of the HP calculator.

       Calculator Key Usage (TI mode): The numbered keys, the +/- key, and the +, -, *, /, and = keys all do exactly
       what you would expect them to.  It should be noted that the operators obey the standard rules of  precedence.
       Thus,  entering "3+4*5=" results in "23", not "35".  The parentheses can be used to override this.  For exam‐
       ple, "(1+2+3)*(4+5+6)=" results in "6*15=90".

       The entire number in the calculator display can be selected, in order to paste the result  of  a  calculation
       into text.

       The  action procedures associated with each function are given below.  These are useful if you are interested
       in defining a custom calculator.  The action used for all digit keys is digit(n), where n is the  correspond‐
       ing digit, 0..9.

       1/x       Replaces  the  number  in  the  display with its reciprocal.  The corresponding action procedure is
                 reciprocal().

       x^2       Squares the number in the display.  The corresponding action procedure is square().

       SQRT      Takes the square root of the number in the display.  The corresponding action procedure is  square‐
                 Root().

       CE/C      When  pressed  once,  clears  the  number in the display without clearing the state of the machine.
                 Allows you to re-enter a number if you make a mistake.  Pressing it twice clears the  state,  also.
                 The corresponding action procedure for TI mode is clear().

       AC        Clears the display, the state, and the memory.  Pressing it with the third pointer button turns off
                 the calculator, in that it exits the program.  The action procedure to clear the state is off(); to
                 quit, quit().

       INV       Invert function.  See the individual function keys for details.  The corresponding action procedure
                 is inverse().

       sin       Computes the sine of the number in the display, as interpreted by the current DRG  mode  (see  DRG,
                 below).  If inverted, it computes the arcsine.  The corresponding action procedure is sine().

       cos       Computes the cosine, or arccosine when inverted.  The corresponding action procedure is cosine().

       tan       Computes  the  tangent,  or  arctangent  when inverted.  The corresponding action procedure is tan‐
                 gent().

       DRG       Changes the DRG mode, as indicated by 'DEG', 'RAD', or 'GRAD' at the bottom of  of  the  calculator
                 ``liquid crystal'' display.  When in 'DEG' mode, numbers in the display are taken as being degrees.
                 In 'RAD' mode, numbers are in radians, and in 'GRAD' mode, numbers are in  grads.   When  inverted,
                 the  DRG key has a feature of converting degrees to radians to grads and vice-versa.  Example:  put
                 the calculator into 'DEG' mode, and enter "45 INV DRG".  The  display  should  now  show  something
                 along  the  lines of ".785398", which is 45 degrees converted to radians.  The corresponding action
                 procedure is degree().

       e         The constant 'e'.  (2.7182818...).  The corresponding action procedure is e().

       EE        Used for entering exponential numbers.  For example, to get "-2.3E-4" you'd enter "2 . 3 +/-  EE  4
                 +/-".  The corresponding action procedure is scientific().

       log       Calculates  the log (base 10) of the number in the display.  When inverted, it raises "10.0" to the
                 number in the display.  For example, entering "3 INV log" should result in "1000".  The correspond‐
                 ing action procedure is logarithm().

       ln        Calculates the log (base e) of the number in the display.  When inverted, it raises "e" to the num‐
                 ber in the display.  For example, entering "e ln" should result in "1".  The  corresponding  action
                 procedure is naturalLog().

       y^x       Raises  the  number  on  the left to the power of the number on the right.  For example "2 y^x 3 ="
                 results in "8", which is 2^3.  For a further example, "(1+2+3) y^x (1+2) =" equals "6 y^x 3"  which
                 equals "216".  The corresponding action procedure is power().

       PI        The constant 'pi'.  (3.1415927....)  The corresponding action procedure is pi().

       x!        Computes  the factorial of the number in the display.  The number in the display must be an integer
                 in the range 0-500, though, depending on your math library, it might  overflow  long  before  that.
                 The corresponding action procedure is factorial().

       (         Left parenthesis.  The corresponding action procedure for TI calculators is leftParen().

       )         Right parenthesis.  The corresponding action procedure for TI calculators is rightParen().

       /         Division.  The corresponding action procedure is divide().

       *         Multiplication.  The corresponding action procedure is multiply().

       -         Subtraction.  The corresponding action procedure is subtract().

       +         Addition.  The corresponding action procedure is add().

       =         Perform calculation.  The TI-specific action procedure is equal().

       STO       Copies  the  number  in  the display to the memory location.  The corresponding action procedure is
                 store().

       RCL       Copies the number from the memory location to the display.  The corresponding action  procedure  is
                 recall().

       SUM       Adds the number in the display to the number in the memory location.  The corresponding action pro‐
                 cedure is sum().

       EXC       Swaps the number in the display with the number in the memory location.  The  corresponding  action
                 procedure for the TI calculator is exchange().

       +/-       Negate; change sign.  The corresponding action procedure is negate().

       .         Decimal point.  The action procedure is decimal().


       Calculator Key Usage (RPN mode): The number keys, CHS (change sign), +, -, *, /, and ENTR keys all do exactly
       what you would expect them to do.  Many of the remaining keys are the same as in TI  mode.   The  differences
       are detailed below.  The action procedure for the ENTR key is enter().


       <-        This  is  a  backspace key that can be used if you make a mistake while entering a number.  It will
                 erase digits from the display.  (See BUGS).  Inverse backspace will clear the X register.  The cor‐
                 responding action procedure is back().

       ON        Clears the display, the state, and the memory.  Pressing it with the third pointer button turns off
                 the calculator, in that it exits the program.  To clear state, the  action  procedure  is  off;  to
                 quit, quit().

       INV       Inverts  the meaning of the function keys.  This would be the  f key on an HP calculator, but xcalc
                 does not display multiple legends on each key.  See the individual function keys for details.

       10^x      Raises "10.0" to the number in the top of the stack.  When inverted, it calculates  the  log  (base
                 10) of the number in the display.  The corresponding action procedure is tenpower().

       e^x       Raises "e" to the number in the top of the stack.  When inverted, it calculates the log (base e) of
                 the number in the display.  The action procedure is epower().

       STO       Copies the number in the top of the stack to a memory location.  There  are  10  memory  locations.
                 The desired memory is specified by following this key with a digit key.

       RCL       Pushes the number from the specified memory location onto the stack.

       SUM       Adds the number on top of the stack to the number in the specified memory location.

       x:y       Exchanges  the  numbers  in  the top two stack positions, the X and Y registers.  The corresponding
                 action procedure is XexchangeY().

       R v       Rolls the stack downward.  When inverted, it rolls the stack upward.  The corresponding action pro‐
                 cedure is roll().

       blank     These  keys  were  used  for programming functions on the HP-10C.  Their functionality has not been
                 duplicated in xcalc.

       Finally, there are two additional action procedures: bell(), which rings the  bell;  and  selection(),  which
       performs a cut on the entire number in the calculator's ``liquid crystal'' display.

ACCELERATORS
       Accelerators  are  shortcuts  for  entering commands.  xcalc provides some sample keyboard accelerators; also
       users can customize accelerators.  The numeric keypad accelerators provided by xcalc  should  be  intuitively
       correct.  The accelerators defined by xcalc on the main keyboard are given below:

                ENTR     Linefeed                              enter()

CUSTOMIZATION
       The application class name is XCalc.

       xcalc has an enormous application defaults file which specifies the position, label, and function of each key
       on the calculator.  It also gives translations to serve as keyboard accelerators.   Because  these  resources
       are not specified in the source code, you can create a customized calculator by writing a private application
       defaults file, using the Athena Command and Form widget resources to specify the size and  position  of  but‐
       tons, the label for each button, and the function of each button.

       The foreground and background colors of each calculator key can be individually specified.  For the TI calcu‐
       lator, a classical color resource specification might be:

       XCalc.ti.Command.background:          gray50
       XCalc.ti.Command.foreground:          white

       For each of buttons 20, 25, 30, 35, and 40, specify:
       XCalc.ti.button20.background:         black
       XCalc.ti.button20.foreground:         white

       For each of buttons 22, 23, 24, 27, 28, 29, 32, 33, 34, 37, 38, and 39:
       XCalc.ti.button22.background:         white
       XCalc.ti.button22.foreground:         black

WIDGET HIERARCHY
       In order to specify resources, it is useful to know the hierarchy of the widgets which compose xcalc.  In the
       notation below, indentation indicates hierarchical structure.  The widget class name is given first, followed
       by the widget instance name.
       XCalc xcalc
               Form  ti  or  hp    (the name depends on the mode)
                       Form  bevel
                               Form  screen
                                       Label  M
                                       Toggle  LCD
                                       Label  INV
                                       Label  DEG
                                       Label  RAD
                                       Label  GRAD
                                       Label  P
                       Command  button1
                       Command  button2
                       Command  button3
       and so on, ...
                       Command  button38
                       Command  button39
                       Command  button40

APPLICATION RESOURCES
       rpn (Class Rpn)
               Specifies that the rpn mode should be used.  The default is TI mode.

       stipple (Class Stipple)
               Indicates that the background should be stippled.  The default is ``on'' for monochrome displays, and
               ``off'' for color displays.

       cursor (Class Cursor)
               The name of the symbol used to represent the pointer.  The default is ``hand2''.

COLORS
       If  you  would like xcalc to use its ti colors, include the following in the #ifdef COLOR section of the file
       you read with xrdb:

       *customization:                 -color

       This will cause xcalc to pick up the colors in  the  app-defaults  color  customization  file:  /etc/X11/app-
       defaults/XCalc-color.
