NAME
       g3topbm - convert a Group 3 fax file into a portable bitmap

SYNOPSIS
       g3topbm [-kludge] [-reversebits] [-stretch] [g3file]

DESCRIPTION
       Reads a Group 3 fax file as input.  Produces a portable bitmap as output.

OPTIONS
       -kludge
              Tells  g3topbm  to  ignore  the first few lines of the file; sometimes fax files have some junk at the
              beginning.

       -reversebits
              Tells g3topbm to interpret bits least-significant  first,  instead  of  the  default  most-significant
              first.   Apparently  some fax modems do it one way and others do it the other way.  If you get a whole
              bunch of "bad code word" messages, try using this flag.

       -stretch
              Tells g3topbm to stretch the image vertically by duplicating each row.  This is  for  the  low-quality
              transmission mode.

       All flags can be abbreviated to their shortest unique prefix.

REFERENCES
       The standard for Group 3 fax is defined in CCITT Recommendation T.4.

BUGS
       Probably.
