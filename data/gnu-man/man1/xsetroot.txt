NAME
       xsetroot - root window parameter setting utility for X

SYNOPSIS
       xsetroot [-help] [-version] [-def] [-display display] [-cursor cursorfile maskfile] [-cursor_name cursorname]
       [-xcf cursorfile cursorsize] [-bitmap filename] [-mod x y] [-gray] [-grey]  [-fg  color]  [-bg  color]  [-rv]
       [-solid color] [-name string]

DESCRIPTION
       The  xsetroot  program allows you to tailor the appearance of the background ("root") window on a workstation
       display running X.  Normally, you experiment with xsetroot until you find a personalized look that you  like,
       then  put the xsetroot command that produces it into your X startup file.  If no options are specified, or if
       -def is specified, the window is reset to its default state.  The -def option can  be  specified  along  with
       other options and only the non-specified characteristics will be reset to the default state.

       Only  one  of  the  background color/tiling changing options (-solid, -gray, -grey, -bitmap, and -mod) may be
       specified at a time.

OPTIONS
       The various options are as follows:

       -help  Print a usage message and exit.

       -verson
              Print a version message and exit.

       -def   Reset unspecified attributes to the default values.  (Restores the background  to  the  familiar  gray
              mesh and the cursor to the hollow x shape.)

       -cursor cursorfile maskfile
              This lets you change the pointer cursor to whatever you want when the pointer cursor is outside of any
              window.  Cursor and mask files are bitmaps (little pictures), and can be made with the bitmap(1)  pro‐
              gram.  You probably want the mask file to be all black until you get used to the way masks work.

       -cursor_name cursorname
              This lets you change the pointer cursor to one of the standard cursors from the cursor font.  Refer to
              appendix B of the X protocol for the names (except that the XC_ prefix is elided for this option).

       -xcf cursorfile cursorsize
              This lets you change the pointer cursor to one loaded from an Xcursor file as defined  by  libXcursor,
              at the specified size.

       -bitmap filename
              Use  the  bitmap  specified in the file to set the window pattern.  You can make your own bitmap files
              (little pictures) using the bitmap(1) program.  The entire background will  be  made  up  of  repeated
              "tiles" of the bitmap.

       -mod x y
              This  is used if you want a plaid-like grid pattern on your screen.  x and y are integers ranging from
              1 to 16.  Try the different combinations.  Zero and negative numbers are taken as 1.

       -gray  Make the entire background gray.  (Easier on the eyes.)

       -grey  Make the entire background grey.

       -fg color
              Use ``color'' as the foreground color.  Foreground and background colors are meaningful only in combi‐
              nation with -cursor, -bitmap, or -mod.

       -bg color
              Use ``color'' as the background color.

       -rv    This  exchanges  the foreground and background colors.  Normally the foreground color is black and the
              background color is white.

       -solid color
              This sets the background of the root window to the specified color.  This option  is  only  useful  on
              color servers.

       -name string
              Set the name of the root window to ``string''.  There is no default value.  Usually a name is assigned
              to a window so that the window manager can use a text representation when  the  window  is  iconified.
              This option is unused since you can't iconify the background.

       -display display
              Specifies the server to connect to; see X(7).
