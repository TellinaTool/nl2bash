TROFF(1)                                       General Commands Manual                                      TROFF(1)



NAME
       troff - the troff processor of the groff text formatting system

SYNOPSIS
       troff [-abcivzCERU] [-d cs] [-f fam] [-F dir] [-I dir] [-m name] [-M dir] [-n num] [-o list] [-r cn]
             [-T name] [-w name] [-W name] [file ...]

DESCRIPTION
       This manual page describes the GNU version of troff.  It is part of the groff document formatting system.  It
       is functionally compatible with UNIX troff, but has many extensions, see groff_diff(7).  Usually it should be
       invoked using the groff(1) command which will also run preprocessors and postprocessors  in  the  appropriate
       order and with the appropriate options.

OPTIONS
       It is possible to have whitespace between a command line option and its parameter.

       -a        Generate an ASCII approximation of the typeset output.

       -b        Print  a  backtrace  with each warning or error message.  This backtrace should help track down the
                 cause of the error.  The line numbers given in the backtrace may not always be correct, for troff's
                 idea of line numbers gets confused by as or am requests.

       -c        Disable color output (always disabled in compatibility mode).

       -C        Enable compatibility mode.

       -dcs
       -dname=s  Define c or name to be a string s; c must be a one letter name.

       -E        Inhibit  all  error  messages  of troff.  Note that this doesn't affect messages output to standard
                 error by macro packages using the tm or tm1 requests.

       -ffam     Use fam as the default font family.

       -Fdir     Search in directory (or directory path) dir for subdirectories devname (name is  the  name  of  the
                 device)  and there for the DESC file and font files.  dir is scanned before all other font directo‐
                 ries.

       -i        Read the standard input after all the named input files have been processed.

       -Idir     This option may be used to add a directory to the search path for files (both those on the  command
                 line  and  those  named in .psbb requests).  The search path is initialized with the current direc‐
                 tory.  This option may be specified more than once; the directories are then searched in the  order
                 specified  (but  before  the current directory).  If you want to make the current directory be read
                 before other directories, add -I. at the appropriate place.

                 No directory search is performed for files with an absolute file name.

       -mname    Read in the file name.tmac.  If it isn't found, try tmac.name instead.  It will be  first  searched
                 for  in  directories  given  with  the  -M  command  line  option, then in directories given in the
                 GROFF_TMAC_PATH environment variable, then in the current directory (only if in unsafe  mode),  the
                 home        directory,        /usr/lib/groff/site-tmac,       /usr/share/groff/site-tmac,       and
                 /usr/share/groff/1.22.2/tmac.

       -Mdir     Search directory (or directory path) dir for macro files.  This is scanned before all  other  macro
                 directories.

       -nnum     Number the first page num.

       -olist    Output  only  pages  in list, which is a comma-separated list of page ranges; n means print page n,
                 m-n means print every page between m and n, -n means print every page up to n, n- means print every
                 page from n.  troff will exit after printing the last page in the list.

       -rcn
       -rname=n  Set  number  register  c  or  name to n; c must be a one character name; n can be any troff numeric
                 expression.

       -R        Don't load troffrc and troffrc-end.

       -Tname    Prepare output for device name, rather than the default  ps;  see  groff(1)  for  a  more  detailed
                 description.

       -U        Unsafe  mode.  This will enable the following requests: open, opena, pso, sy, and pi.  For security
                 reasons, these potentially dangerous requests are disabled otherwise.  It will also add the current
                 directory to the macro search path.

       -v        Print the version number.

       -wname    Enable warning name.  Available warnings are described in the section WARNINGS below.  For example,
                 to enable all warnings, use -w all.  Multiple -w options are allowed.

       -Wname    Inhibit warning name.  Multiple -W options are allowed.

       -z        Suppress formatted output.

WARNINGS
       The warnings that can be given by troff are divided into the following categories.  The name associated  with
       each  warning is used by the -w and -W options; the number is used by the warn request, and by the .warn reg‐
       ister; it is always a power of 2 to allow bitwise composition.

       break           4   In fill mode, lines which could not be broken so that their length was less than the line
                           length.  This is enabled by default.

       char            1   Non-existent characters.  This is enabled by default.

       color      524288   Color related warnings.

       delim           8   Missing or mismatched closing delimiters.

       di            256   Use of di or da without an argument when there is no current diversion.

       el             16   Use of the el request with no matching ie request.

       escape      32768   Unrecognized  escape sequences.  When an unrecognized escape sequence is encountered, the
                           escape character is ignored.

       file      1048576   Indicates a missing file for the mso request.  Enabled by default.

       font       131072   Non-existent fonts.  This is enabled by default.

       ig         262144   Invalid escapes in text ignored with the ig  request.   These  are  conditions  that  are
                           errors when they do not occur in ignored text.

       input       16384   Invalid input characters.

       mac           512   Use  of  undefined  strings,  macros  and diversions.  When an undefined string, macro or
                           diversion is used, that string is automatically defined as empty.  So, in most cases,  at
                           most one warning will be given for each name.

       missing      8192   Requests that are missing non-optional arguments.

       number          2   Invalid numeric expressions.  This is enabled by default.

       range          64   Out of range arguments.

       reg          1024   Use  of undefined number registers.  When an undefined number register is used, that reg‐
                           ister is automatically defined to have a value of 0.  So, in  most  cases,  at  most  one
                           warning will be given for use of a particular name.

       right-brace  4096   Use of \} where a number was expected.

       scale          32   Meaningless scaling indicators.

       space       65536   Missing  space  between  a request or macro and its argument.  This warning will be given
                           when an undefined name longer than two characters is encountered, and the first two char‐
                           acters  of the name make a defined name.  The request or macro will not be invoked.  When
                           this warning is given, no macro is automatically defined.  This is  enabled  by  default.
                           This warning will never occur in compatibility mode.

       syntax        128   Dubious syntax in numeric expressions.

       tab          2048   Inappropriate  use  of a tab character.  Either use of a tab character where a number was
                           expected, or use of tab character in an unquoted macro argument.

       There are also names that can be used to refer to groups of warnings:

       all    All warnings except di, mac, and reg.  It is intended that this covers all warnings  that  are  useful
              with traditional macro packages.

       w      All warnings.

ENVIRONMENT
       GROFF_TMAC_PATH
              A colon separated list of directories in which to search for macro files.  troff will scan directories
              given in the -M option before these, and in standard directories (current directory if in unsafe mode,
              home  directory,  /usr/lib/groff/site-tmac,  /usr/share/groff/site-tmac, /usr/share/groff/1.22.2/tmac)
              after these.

       GROFF_TYPESETTER
              Default device.

       GROFF_FONT_PATH
              A colon separated list of directories in which to search for the devname directory.  troff  will  scan
              directories  given  in the -F option before these, and in standard directories (/usr/share/groff/site-
              font, /usr/share/groff/1.22.2/font, /usr/lib/font) after these.

FILES
       /usr/share/groff/1.22.2/tmac/troffrc
              Initialization file (called before any other macro package).

       /usr/share/groff/1.22.2/tmac/troffrc-end
              Initialization file (called after any other macro package).

       /usr/share/groff/1.22.2/tmac/name.tmac
       /usr/share/groff/1.22.2/tmac/tmac.name
              Macro files

       /usr/share/groff/1.22.2/font/devname/DESC
              Device description file for device name.

       /usr/share/groff/1.22.2/font/devname/F
              Font file for font F of device name.

       Note that troffrc and troffrc-end are neither searched in the current nor in the home  directory  by  default
       for security reasons (even if the -U option is given).  Use the -M command line option or the GROFF_TMAC_PATH
       environment variable to add these directories to the search path if necessary.
