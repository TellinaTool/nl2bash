DESCRIPTION
       Eject  allows removable media (typically a CD-ROM, floppy disk, tape, or JAZ or ZIP disk) to be ejected under
       software control. The command can also control some multi-disc CD-ROM changers, the auto-eject  feature  sup‐
       ported by some devices, and close the disc tray of some CD-ROM drives.

       The  device  corresponding  to <name> is ejected. The name can be a device file or mount point, either a full
       path or with the leading "/dev", "/media" or "/mnt" omitted. If  no  name  is  specified,  the  default  name
       "cdrom" is used.

       There  are  four  different  methods  of  ejecting, depending on whether the device is a CD-ROM, SCSI device,
       removable floppy, or tape. By default eject tries all four methods in order until it succeeds.

       If the device is currently mounted, it is unmounted before ejecting.


COMMAND-LINE OPTIONS
       -h   This option causes eject to display a brief description of the command options.


       -v   This makes eject run in verbose mode; more information is displayed about what the command is doing.


       -d   If invoked with this option, eject lists the default device name.


       -a on|1|off|0
            This option controls the auto-eject mode, supported by some devices.  When enabled, the drive  automati‐
            cally ejects when the device is closed.


       -c <slot>
            With  this  option  a  CD  slot can be selected from an ATAPI/IDE CD-ROM changer. Linux 2.0 or higher is
            required to use this feature. The CD-ROM drive can not be in use (mounted data CD or playing a music CD)
            for  a  change request to work. Please also note that the first slot of the changer is referred to as 0,
            not 1.


       -i on|1|off|0
            This option controls locking of the hardware eject button. When enabled, the drive will not  be  ejected
            when  the  button  is pressed.  This is useful when you are carrying a laptop in a bag or case and don't
            want it to eject if the button is inadvertently pressed.


       -t   With this option the drive is given a CD-ROM tray close command. Not all devices support this command.


       -T   With this option the drive is given a CD-ROM tray close command if it's opened, and a CD-ROM tray  eject
            command  if  it's  closed.  Not  all devices support this command, because it uses the above CD-ROM tray
            close command.


       -x <speed>
            With this option the drive is given a CD-ROM select speed command.  The speed argument is a number indi‐
            cating the desired speed (e.g. 8 for 8X speed), or 0 for maximum data rate. Not all devices support this
            command and you can only specify speeds that the drive is capable of. Every time the  media  is  changed
            this option is cleared. This option can be used alone, or with the -t and -c options.


       -X   With this option the CD-ROM drive will be probed to detect the available speeds. The output is a list of
            speeds which can be used as an argument of the -x option. This only works with Linux 2.6.13  or  higher,
            on  previous  versions solely the maximum speed will be reported. Also note that some drive may not cor‐
            rectly report the speed and therefore this option does not work with them.


       -n   With this option the selected device is displayed but no action is performed.


       -r   This option specifies that the drive should be ejected using a CDROM eject command.


       -s   This option specifies that the drive should be ejected using SCSI commands.


       -f   This option specifies that the drive should be ejected using a removable floppy disk eject command.


       -q   This option specifies that the drive should be ejected using a tape drive offline command.


       -p   This option allow you to use /proc/mounts instead /etc/mtab. It also passes the -n option to umount(1).


       -m   This option allows eject to work with device drivers  which  automatically  mount  removable  media  and
            therefore  must  be  always  mount(1)ed.  The option tells eject to not try to unmount the given device,
            even if it is mounted according to /etc/mtab or /proc/mounts.


       -V   This option causes eject to display the program version and exit.


LONG OPTIONS
       All options have corresponding long names, as listed below. The long names can be abbreviated as long as they
       are unique.

       -h --help
       -v --verbose
       -d --default
       -a --auto
       -c --changerslot
       -t --trayclose
       -T --traytoggle
       -x --cdspeed
       -X --listspeed
       -n --noop
       -r --cdrom
       -s --scsi
       -f --floppy
       -q --tape
       -V --version
       -p --proc
       -m --no-unmount


EXAMPLES
       Eject the default device:

              eject

       Eject a device or mount point named cdrom:

              eject cdrom

       Eject using device name:

              eject /dev/cdrom

       Eject using mount point:

              eject /mnt/cdrom/

       Eject 4th IDE device:

              eject hdd

       Eject first SCSI device:

              eject sda

       Eject using SCSI partition name (e.g. a ZIP drive):

              eject sda4

       Select 5th disc on multi-disc changer:

              eject -v -c4 /dev/cdrom

       Turn on auto-eject on a SoundBlaster CD-ROM drive:

              eject -a on /dev/sbpcd


EXIT STATUS
       Returns 0 if operation was successful, 1 if operation failed or command syntax was not valid.


NOTES
       Eject  only  works  with devices that support one or more of the four methods of ejecting. This includes most
       CD-ROM drives (IDE, SCSI, and proprietary), some SCSI tape drives, JAZ drives,  ZIP  drives  (parallel  port,
       SCSI, and IDE versions), and LS120 removable floppies. Users have also reported success with floppy drives on
       Sun SPARC and Apple Macintosh systems. If eject does not work, it is most likely a limitation of  the  kernel
       driver for the device and not the eject program itself.

       The -r, -s, -f, and -q options allow controlling which methods are used to eject. More than one method can be
       specified. If none of these options are specified, it tries all four (this works fine in most cases).

       Eject may not always be able to determine if the device is mounted (e.g. if it has  several  names).  If  the
       device name is a symbolic link, eject will follow the link and use the device that it points to.

       If eject determines that the device can have multiple partitions, it will attempt to unmount all mounted par‐
       titions of the device before ejecting. If an unmount fails, the program will not attempt to eject the media.

       You can eject an audio CD. Some CD-ROM drives will refuse to open the  tray  if  the  drive  is  empty.  Some
       devices do not support the tray close command.

       If  the  auto-eject feature is enabled, then the drive will always be ejected after running this command. Not
       all Linux kernel CD-ROM drivers support the auto-eject mode. There is no way to find out  the  state  of  the
       auto-eject mode.

       You  need  appropriate  privileges  to access the device files. Running as root or setuid root is required to
       eject some devices (e.g. SCSI devices).

       The heuristic used to find a device, given a name, is as follows. If the name ends in a trailing slash, it is
       removed  (this  is  to support filenames generated using shell file name completion). If the name starts with
       '.' or '/', it tries to open it as a device file or mount point. If that fails, it tries prepending  '/dev/',
       '/media/'  ,'/mnt/',  '/dev/cdroms',  '/dev/rdsk/', '/dev/dsk/', and finally './' to the name, until a device
       file or mount point is found that can be opened. The program checks /etc/mtab for mounted  devices.  If  that
       fails, it also checks /etc/fstab for mount points of currently unmounted devices.

       Creating  symbolic links such as /dev/cdrom or /dev/zip is recommended so that eject can determine the appro‐
       priate devices using easily remembered names.

       To save typing you can create a shell alias for the eject options that work for your particular setup.
