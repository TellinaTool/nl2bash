NAME
       bbox - prints out the bounding box of a rawppm or rawpbm image

SYNOPSIS
       bbox [ -l ] [ -r ] [ -h ] [ -V ] [ rawpbmfile ]


DESCRIPTION
       bbox reads a rawppm or rawpbm file and prints out the bounding box of the image (as postscript comment and in
       postscript points, i.e. 1/72dpi) as well as the high resolution bounding box. Input  is  read  from  standard
       input if no filename is specified.  Example output:

              %%BoundingBox: 12 253 829 837
              %%HiResBoundingBox: 12.500000 253.000000 828.500000 837.00000


       bbox  has  only  very  limited memory requirements as it reads the input line by line and thus needs to store
       only one picture line in memory.

OPTIONS
       -h | --help
              Show summary of options.

       -V     Show version of program.

       -r     resolution of picture in dpi

       -l     loose bounding box (integer bounding box is expanded by 1 point, hires bounding box is expanded by 0.5
              points)
