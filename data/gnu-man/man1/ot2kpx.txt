NAME
       ot2kpx - extract kerning information from OpenType fonts

SYNOPSIS
       ot2kpx  fontfile

DESCRIPTION
       ot2kpx extract the kerning data from OpenType fonts (both otf and ttf formats) and prints it (in afm format)
       to "stdout".

OPTIONS AND ARGUMENTS
       fontfile
           The OpenType font (in either otf or ttf format).

RESTRICTIONS
       -   ot2kpx doesn't implement all of the OpenType specification.  Things that are missing include: support for
           font files containing multiple fonts, LookupTables with LookupTypes other than 2, "kern" tables with
           format other than 0 and ValueRecords with other types of data than just XAdvance data.

           Most of these limitations won't matter, since the missing features are rare (the only fonts I know of
           that use them are the non-western fonts that come with Adobe Reader). Furthermore, many of these features
           define (according to the OpenType specification) "subtle, device-dependent adjustments at specific font
           sizes or device resolutions"; since there's no way to express such adjustments in afm format, ignoring
           them seems to be the only option anyway.

       -   ot2kpx collects kerning data first from the "kern" table, then from all LookupTables associated with the
           "kern" feature; if a kerning pair occurs multiple times, the first value seen is chosen.  There are (or
           may be) several issues with this approach:

           -   The OpenType specification says that fonts in otf format shouldn't use the "kern" table at all, just
               the lookups from the "GPOS" table.  Many such fonts do, however, contain a "kern" table, but no
               "GPOS" table; so we use the "kern" table anyway.

           -   Instead of reading all LookupTables, it might be better to let the user specify a script and language
               and process only the LookupTables for those values.  However, at least in the fonts I checked, all
               script/language combinations eventually point to the same "kern" LookupTables, so this approach
               wouldn't make any difference (apart from further complicating the code).

RECENT CHANGES
       (See the source code for the rest of the story.)

       2013-08-07  Replaced all "given/when" constructions in the source code by "if"'s, to avoid warnings about
                   experimental features in Perl 5.18 and later.

       2012-02-01  Refactored the code, and fixed a number of bugs in the process.  Updated the documentation.
