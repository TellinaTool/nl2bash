FLOCK(1)                                            User Commands                                           FLOCK(1)



NAME
       flock - manage locks from shell scripts

SYNOPSIS
       flock [-sxon] [-w timeout] lockfile [-c] command...

       flock [-sxon] [-w timeout] lockdir [-c] command...

       flock [-sxun] [-w timeout] fd

DESCRIPTION
       This utility manages flock(2) locks from within shell scripts or the command line.

       The  first  and  second  forms wraps the lock around the executing a command, in a manner similar to su(1) or
       newgrp(1).  It locks a specified file or directory, which is created (assuming appropriate  permissions),  if
       it does not already exist.

       The third form is convenient inside shell scripts, and is usually used the following manner:

       (
         flock -n 9 || exit 1
         # ... commands executed under lock ...
       ) 9>/var/lock/mylockfile

       The mode used to open the file doesn't matter to flock; using > or >> allows the lockfile to be created if it
       does not already exist, however, write permission is required; using < requires that the file already  exists
       but only read permission is required.

       By default, if the lock cannot be immediately acquired, flock waits until the lock is available.

OPTIONS
       -s, --shared
              Obtain a shared lock, sometimes called a read lock.

       -x, -e, --exclusive
              Obtain an exclusive lock, sometimes called a write lock.  This is the default.

       -u, --unlock
              Drop  a  lock.   This  is usually not required, since a lock is automatically dropped when the file is
              closed.  However, it may be required in special cases, for example if the enclosed command  group  may
              have forked a background process which should not be holding the lock.

       -n, --nb, --nonblock
              Fail (with an exit code of 1) rather than wait if the lock cannot be immediately acquired.

       -w, --wait, --timeout seconds
              Fail  (with  an  exit code of 1) if the lock cannot be acquired within seconds seconds.  Decimal frac‐
              tional values are allowed.

       -o, --close
              Close the file descriptor on which the lock is held before executing command.  This is useful if  com‐
              mand spawns a child process which should not be holding the lock.

       -c, --command command
              Pass a single command to the shell with -c.

       -h, --help
              Print a help message.
