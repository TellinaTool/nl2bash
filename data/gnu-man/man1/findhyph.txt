FINDHYPH(1)                                                                                              FINDHYPH(1)



NAME
       findhyph - find words hyphenated by TeX in a document

INSTALLATION
       Copy findhyph or findhyph.bat (depending on OS used) to a directory included in system PATH. Perl interpreter
       is required to be in "/usr/bin/" for Unix-like systems or in PATH when using findhyph.bat.

SYNOPSIS
       findhyph [options] foo.log

DESCRIPTION
       To use this program:

       1)  set "\tracingparagraphs=1" in a TeX document foo.tex and run:

       2)  tex foo.tex

       3)  findhyph [options] foo.log

       If you are setting "\looseness=<N>" to optimize paragraphs, you need to pass that information to the file
       foo.log in a form "@looseness=<N>" (on a separate line). You can use a macro like
       "\def\setlooseness#1{\looseness=#1 \immediate\write-1{@looseness=#1}}" for this purpose. If the paragraph
       contains material in display math mode, you need to use the macro in all split parts of the paragraph.

OPTIONS
       -c  display hyphenated words in context

       -f  display font selectors and other strings starting with a backslash character

       -v  display program version

       -p  generate file containing information about one-letter prepositions and conjunctions left at the end of
           line

       -l=STRING
           use prepositions/conjunctions listed in STRING instead of default list of prepositions and conjunctions
           "kKsSvVzZoOuUiIA" used for Slovak and Czech language

OUTPUT FILES
       foo.hyph
           List of hyphenated words. All punctuation characters, parentheses and other character immediately
           preceding or following displayed words are included in this list. TeX constructs which are too difficult
           to display ("\hbox{}", "\mark{}" etc.) are shown as "[]". Math mode is indicated by "$" sign.

           Page numbers in square brackets refer to LOG file and may occasionally differ from the typeset document.
           The reason is that TeX may need to break more paragraphs than it would eventually fit on the page in
           order to find a page break.

           Words hyphenated in footnotes are listed before the words hyphenated in the paragraph in which the
           footnote is referenced.

       foo.prep
           List of prepositions if option -p is used.

HISTORY
       1.0 (2001-04-08)

       ·   public release

       2.0 (2009-08-10)

       ·   fixes in line breaks detection algorithm; support for the third pass of line breaking algorithm in TeX
           (positive \emergencystretch); support for discretionary breaks in the first pass

       ·   page number detection improved (recognized negative page numbers, compound page numbers when "\count1" to
           "\count9" registers are non-zero and "[nn{mapfile}]", "[nn<picture>]" and "[nn<newline>" formats used by
           pdfTeX; false page number detection should be much more rare)

       ·   configurable list of prepositions and conjunctions

       ·   hyphenated words can be displayed in context

       ·   suggestions and testing by Pavel Striz

       3.0 (2012-02-01)

       ·   fixed a bug when total paragraph demerits are negative

       ·   "\looseness" setting is now taken into account (thanks to Karel Horak for identifying the issue)

       3.1 (2012-11-03)

       ·   fixed displaying of hyphenated ligatures (bug reported by Karel Horak)

       3.2 (2012-11-21)

       ·   improved example definition of the "\setlooseness" macro (thanks to Karl Berry)

       3.3 (2013-06-18)

       ·   fixed the manual page as suggested by Eric S. Raymond
