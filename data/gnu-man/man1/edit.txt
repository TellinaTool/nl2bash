RUN-MAILCAP(1)                                  Run Mailcap Programs                                  RUN-MAILCAP(1)



NAME
       run-mailcap, view, see, edit, compose, print - execute programs via entries in the mailcap file

SYNOPSIS
       run-mailcap --action=ACTION [--option[=value]] [MIME-TYPE:[ENCODING:]]FILE [...]

       The see, edit, compose and print versions are just aliases that default to the view, edit, compose, and print
       actions (respectively).


DESCRIPTION
       run-mailcap (or any of its aliases) will use the given action to process each mime-type/file in  turn.   Each
       file  is  specified  as  its  mime-type, its encoding (e.g. compression), and filename together, separated by
       colons.  If the mime-type is omitted, an attempt to determine the type is made by trying to match the  file's
       extension  with  those  in the mime.types files.  If the encoding is omitted, it will also be determined from
       the file's extensions.  Currently supported encodings are gzip (.gz), bzip (.bz), bzip2 (.bz2), and  compress
       (.Z).  A filename of "-" can be used to mean "standard input", but then a mime-type must be specified.

       Both  the  user's  files (~/.mailcap; ~/.mime.types) and the system files (/etc/mailcap; /etc/mime.types) are
       searched in turn for information.

   EXAMPLES
         see picture.jpg
         print output.ps.gz
         compose text/html:index.htm
         extract-mail-attachment msg.txt | see image/tiff:gzip:-

   OPTIONS
       All options are in the form --<opt>=<value>.

       --action=<action>
              Performs the specified action on the files.  Valid actions are view, cat  (uses  only  "copiousoutput"
              rules and sends output to STDOUT) , compose, composetyped, edit and print.  If no action is specified,
              the action will be determined by how the program was called.

       --debug
              Turns on extra information to find out what is happening.

       --nopager
              Ignores any "copiousoutput" directive and sends output to STDOUT.

       --norun
              Displays the found command without actually executing it.
