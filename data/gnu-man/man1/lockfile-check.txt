NAME
       lockfile-progs - command-line programs to safely lock and unlock files and mailboxes (via liblockfile).

SYNOPSIS
       mail-lock [--use-pid] [--retry retry-count]
       mail-unlock
       mail-touchlock [--oneshot]

       lockfile-create [--use-pid] [--retry retry-count] [--lock-name] filename
       lockfile-remove [--lock-name] filename
       lockfile-touch [--oneshot] [--lock-name] filename
       lockfile-check [--use-pid] [--lock-name] filename

DESCRIPTION
       Lockfile-progs  provides a set a programs that can be used to lock and unlock mailboxes and files safely (via
       liblockfile):

           mail-lock - lock the current user's mailbox
           mail-unlock - unlock the current user's mailbox
           mail-touchlock - touch the lock on the current user's mailbox

           lockfile-create - lock a given file
           lockfile-remove - remove the lock on a given file
           lockfile-touch - touch the lock on a given file
           lockfile-check - check the lock on a given file

       By default, the filename argument refers to the name of the file to be locked, and the name of  the  lockfile
       will  be  filename  .lock.  However, if the --lock-name argument is specified, then filename will be taken as
       the name of the lockfile itself.

       Each of the mail locking commands attempts to lock /var/spool/mail/<user>, where <user> is the  name  associ‐
       ated with the effective user ID, as determined by via geteuid(2).

       Once  a file is locked, the lock must be touched at least once every five minutes or the lock will be consid‐
       ered stale, and subsequent lock attempts will succeed.  Also see the --use-pid option and  the  lockfile_cre‐
       ate(3) manpage.

       The lockfile-check command tests whether or not a valid lock already exists.


OPTIONS
       -q, --quiet
           Suppress any output.  Success or failure will only be indicated by the exit status.

       -v, --verbose
           Enable diagnostic output.

       -l, --lock-name
           Do  not append .lock to the filename.  This option applies to lockfile-create, lockfile-remove, lockfile-
           touch, or lockfile-check.

       -p, --use-pid
           Write the parent process id (PPID) to the lockfile whenever a lockfile is created, and use that pid  when
           checking  a  lock's  validity.   See  the  lockfile_create(3)  manpage for more information.  This option
           applies to lockfile-create and lockfile-check.   NOTE:  this  option  will  not  work  correctly  between
           machines sharing a filesystem.

       -o, --oneshot
           Touch the lock and exit immediately.  This option applies to lockfile-touch and mail-touchlock.  When not
           provided, these commands will run forever, touching the lock once every minute until killed.

       -r retry-count, --retry retry-count
           Try to lock filename retry-count times before giving up.  Each attempt will be delayed a bit longer  than
           the  last  (in  5  second  increments)  until reaching a maximum delay of one minute between retries.  If
           retry-count is unspecified, the default is 9 which will give up after 180 seconds (3 minutes)  if  all  9
           lock attempts fail.


EXAMPLES
       Locking a file during a lengthy process:

         lockfile-create /some/file
         lockfile-touch /some/file &
         # Save the PID of the lockfile-touch process
         BADGER="$!"
         do-something-important-with /some/file
         kill "${BADGER}"
         lockfile-remove /some/file


EXIT STATUS
       0
           For  lockfile-check  this indicates that a valid lock exists, otherwise it just indicates successful pro‐
           gram execution.

       Not 0
           For lockfile-check a non-zero exit status indicates that the specified lock does  not  exist  or  is  not
           valid.  For other programs it indicates that some problem was encountered.
