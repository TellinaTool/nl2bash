DESCRIPTION
       scanimage is a command-line interface to control image acquisition devices such as flatbed scanners  or  cam‐
       eras.   The device is controlled via command-line options.  After command-line processing, scanimage normally
       proceeds to acquire an image.  The image data is written to standard output  in  one  of  the  PNM  (portable
       aNyMaP)  formats  (PBM  for black-and-white images, PGM for grayscale images, and PPM for color images) or in
       TIFF (black-and-white, grayscale or color).  scanimage accesses image acquisition devices  through  the  SANE
       (Scanner  Access  Now  Easy)  interface and can thus support any device for which there exists a SANE backend
       (try apropos sane- to get a list of available backends).


EXAMPLES
       To get a list of devices:

         scanimage -L

       To scan with default settings to the file image.pnm:

         scanimage >image.pnm

       To scan 100x100 mm to the file image.tiff (-x and -y may not be available with all devices):

         scanimage -x 100 -y 100 --format=tiff >image.tiff

       To print all available options:

         scanimage -h


OPTIONS
       Parameters are separated by a blank from single-character options (e.g.  -d epson) and by a "="  from  multi-
       character options (e.g. --device-name=epson).


       The -d or --device-name options must be followed by a SANE device-name like `epson:/dev/sg0' or `hp:/dev/usb‐
       scanner0'.  A (partial) list of available devices can be obtained with the --list-devices option (see below).
       If  no  device-name  is  specified  explicitly,  scanimage  reads a device-name from the environment variable
       SANE_DEFAULT_DEVICE.  If this variable is not set, scanimage will attempt to open the first available device.

       The --format format option selects how image data is written to standard output.  format can be pnm or  tiff.
       If --format is not used, PNM is written.

       The -i or --icc-profile option is used to include an ICC profile into a TIFF file.

       The  -L  or  --list-devices  option requests a (partial) list of devices that are available.  The list is not
       complete since some devices may be available, but are not listed in any of the configuration files (which are
       typically  stored  in  directory /etc/sane.d).  This is particularly the case when accessing scanners through
       the network.  If a device is not listed in a configuration file, the only way to access it  is  by  its  full
       device name.  You may need to consult your system administrator to find out the names of such devices.

       The  -f  or  --formatted-device-list  option  works  similar to --list-devices, but requires a format string.
       scanimage replaces the placeholders %d %v %m %t %i %n with the device name, vendor name, model name,  scanner
       type, an index number and newline respectively. The command

              scanimage -f “ scanner number %i device %d is a %t, model %m, produced by %v ”

       will produce something like:

              scanner number 0  device sharp:/dev/sg1 is  a  flatbed scanner, model JX250 SCSI, produced by SHARP

       The --batch* options provide the features for scanning documents using document feeders.  --batch [format] is
       used to specify the format of the filename that each page will be written to.  Each page is written out to  a
       single  file.   If format is not specified, the default of out%d.pnm (or out%d.tif for --format tiff) will be
       used.  format is given as a printf style string with one integer parameter.  --batch-start start selects  the
       page  number  to  start  naming  files  with.  If  this  option  is  not  given, the counter will start at 1.
       --batch-count count specifies the number of pages to attempt to scan.  If not given, scanimage will  continue
       scanning until the scanner returns a state other than OK.  Not all scanners with document feeders signal when
       the ADF is empty, use this command to work around them.  With --batch-increment increment you can change  the
       amount  that the number in the filename is incremented by.  Generally this is used when you are scanning dou‐
       ble-sided documents on a single-sided  document  feeder.   A  specific  command  is  provided  to  aid  this:
       --batch-double will automatically set the increment to 2.  --batch-prompt will ask for pressing RETURN before
       scanning a page. This can be used for scanning multiple pages without an automatic document feeder.

       The --accept-md5-only option only accepts user authorization requests that support  MD5  security.  The  SANE
       network daemon (saned) is capable of doing such requests. See saned(8).

       The  -p  or --progress option requests that scanimage prints a progress counter. It shows how much image data
       of the current image has already been received by scanimage (in percent).

       The -n or --dont-scan option requests that scanimage only sets the options provided by the user  but  doesn't
       actually  perform  a  scan.  This option can be used to e.g. turn off the scanner's lamp (if supported by the
       backend).

       The -T or --test option requests that scanimage performs a few simple sanity tests to make sure  the  backend
       works as defined by the SANE API (in particular the sane_read function is exercised by this test).

       The  -A  or  --all-options  option  requests  that scanimage lists all available options exposed the backend,
       including button options.  The information is printed on standard output and no scan will be done.

       The -h or --help options request help information.  The information is printed on standard output and in this
       case, no attempt will be made to acquire an image.

       The  -v  or --verbose options increase the verbosity of the operation of scanimage.  The option may be speci‐
       fied repeatedly, each time increasing the verbosity level.

       The -B or --buffer-size changes the input buffer size from 32KB to the number kB specified or 1M.

       The -V or --version option requests that scanimage prints the program and package name, the version number of
       the  SANE distribution that it came with and the version of the backend that it loads. Usually that's the dll
       backend. If more information about the version numbers of the backends are necessary, the DEBUG variable  for
       the dll backend can be used. Example: SANE_DEBUG_DLL=3 scanimage -L.

       As  you  might imagine, much of the power of scanimage comes from the fact that it can control any SANE back‐
       end.  Thus, the exact set of command-line options depends on the capabilities of the selected device.  To see
       the options for a device named dev, invoke scanimage via a command-line of the form:

              scanimage --help --device-name dev

       The documentation for the device-specific options printed by --help is best explained with a few examples:

        -l 0..218mm [0]
           Top-left x position of scan area.

              The description above shows that option -l expects an option value in the range from 0 to 218 mm.  The
              value in square brackets indicates that the current option value is 0 mm. Most backends provide  simi‐
              lar geometry options for top-left y position (-t), width (-x) and height of scan-area (-y).


        --brightness -100..100% [0]
           Controls the brightness of the acquired image.

              The description above shows that option --brightness expects an option value in the range from -100 to
              100 percent.  The value in square brackets indicates that the current option value is 0 percent.

        --default-enhancements
           Set default values for enhancement controls.

              The description above shows that option --default-enhancements has no  option  value.   It  should  be
              thought  of  as  having an immediate effect at the point of the command-line at which it appears.  For
              example,  since  this  option  resets  the  --brightness  option,  the  option-pair  --brightness   50
              --default-enhancements would effectively be a no-op.

        --mode Lineart|Gray|Color [Gray]
           Selects the scan mode (e.g., lineart or color).

              The  description  above  shows  that option --mode accepts an argument that must be one of the strings
              Lineart, Gray, or Color.  The value in the square bracket indicates that the option is  currently  set
              to  Gray.  For convenience, it is legal to abbreviate the string values as long as they remain unique.
              Also, the case of the spelling doesn't matter.  For example, option setting --mode col is identical to
              --mode Color.

        --custom-gamma[=(yes|no)] [inactive]
           Determines whether a builtin or a custom gamma-table
           should be used.

              The description above shows that option --custom-gamma expects either no option value, a "yes" string,
              or a "no" string.  Specifying the option with no value is equivalent to specifying "yes".   The  value
              in  square-brackets indicates that the option is not currently active.  That is, attempting to set the
              option would result in an error message.  The set of available options typically depends on  the  set‐
              tings  of  other options.  For example, the --custom-gamma table might be active only when a grayscale
              or color scan-mode has been requested.

              Note that the --help option is processed only after all other options have been processed.  This makes
              it  possible  to  see  the  option  settings for a particular mode by specifying the appropriate mode-
              options along with the --help option.  For example, the command-line:

              scanimage --help --mode color

              would print the option settings that are in effect when the color-mode is selected.

        --gamma-table 0..255,...
           Gamma-correction table.  In color mode this option
           equally affects the red, green, and blue channels
           simultaneously (i.e., it is an intensity gamma table).

              The description above shows that option --gamma-table expects zero or more values in the  range  0  to
              255.   For  example, a legal value for this option would be "3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12".  Since it's cum‐
              bersome to specify long vectors in this form, the same  can  be  expressed  by  the  abbreviated  form
              "[0]3-[9]12".   What  this means is that the first vector element is set to 3, the 9-th element is set
              to 12 and the values in between are interpolated linearly.  Of course, it is possible to specify  mul‐
              tiple   such   linear   segments.    For   example,   "[0]3-[2]3-[6]7,[7]10-[9]6"   is  equivalent  to
              "3,3,3,4,5,6,7,10,8,6".  The program gamma4scanimage can be used to generate such  gamma  tables  (see
              gamma4scanimage(1) for details).

        --filename <string> [/tmp/input.ppm]
           The filename of the image to be loaded.

              The  description  above is an example of an option that takes an arbitrary string value (which happens
              to be a filename).  Again, the value in brackets show that the option is current set to  the  filename
              /tmp/input.ppm.


ENVIRONMENT
       SANE_DEFAULT_DEVICE
              The default device-name.

FILES
       /etc/sane.d
              This  directory  holds  various  configuration  files.   For details, please refer to the manual pages
              listed below.

       ~/.sane/pass
              This file contains lines of the form

              user:password:resource

              scanimage uses this information to answer user authorization requests  automatically.  The  file  must
              have  0600 permissions or stricter. You should use this file in conjunction with the --accept-md5-only
              option to avoid server-side attacks. The resource may contain any character  but  is  limited  to  127
              characters.
