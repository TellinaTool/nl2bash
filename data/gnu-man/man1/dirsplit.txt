DIRSPLIT(1)                                         User Commands                                        DIRSPLIT(1)



NAME
       dirsplit - splits directory into multiple with equal size

SYNOPSIS
       dirsplit [options] < directory | content-list-file >

DESCRIPTION
       displit  is  designed  to  for  a simple purpose: convert a directory with many multiple files (which are all
       smaller than a certain medium, eg.  DVD) and "splits" it into "volumes", looking for the optimal order to get
       the best space/medium-number efficiency.

       The actual action is either adding the files to mkisofs catalogs or real moving of files into new directories
       (or creating links/symlinks).  The method is not limited to files, whole directories can also be handled this
       way (see various filesystem exploration modes).
