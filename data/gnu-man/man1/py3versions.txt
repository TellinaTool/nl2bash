NAME
       py3versions - print python3 version information

SYNOPSIS
       py3versions [-h] [-v] [<options>]

DESCRIPTION
       py3versions  prints  information about installed, supported python3 runtimes, the default runtime, and parses
       the information of the PythonVersion fields in the package control file for Python3.

OPTIONS
       -d, --default
              Show the default python3 version.

       -s, --supported
              Show the supported python3 versions.

       -r, --requested [<version string>|<control file>]
              Reads the value of the X-Python3-Version field in the source section of a control file and  shows  all
              matching  python3 versions. The parameter is interpreted as a version string, if it is not the name of
              a file. If the X-Python3-Version field is missing, it will fall back to  list  the  supported  Python3
              versions  after  checking debian/control. Versions less than 3 are ignored. The keyword all is ignored
              because it covers all Python2 versions.  The former  keyword  current  is  not  supported  at  all  in
              Python3.

       -i, --installed
              Show the installed supported python3 versions.

       -v, --version
              Limit the output to the version numbers of the python3 versions.

       -h, --help
              Print a help text.
