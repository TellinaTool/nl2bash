NAME
       dh_installxfonts - register X fonts

SYNOPSIS
       dh_installxfonts [debhelper options]

DESCRIPTION
       dh_installxfonts is a debhelper program that is responsible for registering X fonts, so their corresponding
       fonts.dir, fonts.alias, and fonts.scale be rebuilt properly at install time.

       Before calling this program, you should have installed any X fonts provided by your package into the
       appropriate location in the package build directory, and if you have fonts.alias or fonts.scale files, you
       should install them into the correct location under etc/X11/fonts in your package build directory.

       Your package should depend on xfonts-utils so that the update-fonts-* commands are available. (This program
       adds that dependency to ${misc:Depends}.)

       This program automatically generates the postinst and postrm commands needed to register X fonts. These
       commands are inserted into the maintainer scripts by dh_installdeb. See dh_installdeb(1) for an explanation
       of how this works.

NOTES
       See update-fonts-alias(8), update-fonts-scale(8), and update-fonts-dir(8) for more information about X font
       installation.

       See Debian policy, section 11.8.5. for details about doing fonts the Debian way.
