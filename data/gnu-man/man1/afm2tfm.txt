NAME
       afm2tfm - convert Adobe font metrics to TeX font metrics

DESCRIPTION
       PostScript fonts are (or should be) accompanied by font metric files such as Times-Roman.afm, which describes
       the characteristics of the font called Times-Roman.  To use such fonts with TeX, we need TFM files that  con‐
       tain  similar information. This program does that conversion.  For more information, print out the dvips man‐
       ual.

FILES
       psfonts.map in the config directory used by dvips (update this).
       ../afm/Makefile in the dvips sources (look at this for examples).

SEE ALSO
       dvips(1), tex(1), vptovf(1)

BUGS
       An option to add letterspacing to the virtual font was rejected by Knuth because it would make the fi and  fl
       ligatures break the normal rhythmic pattern.
