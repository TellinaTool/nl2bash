LESSKEY(1)                                     General Commands Manual                                    LESSKEY(1)



NAME
       lesskey - specify key bindings for less

SYNOPSIS
       lesskey [-o output] [--] [input]
       lesskey [--output=output] [--] [input]
       lesskey -V
       lesskey --version

DESCRIPTION
       Lesskey  is  used  to  specify a set of key bindings to be used by less.  The input file is a text file which
       describes the key bindings.  If the input file is "-", standard input is read.  If no input  file  is  speci‐
       fied,  a  standard filename is used as the name of the input file, which depends on the system being used: On
       Unix systems, $HOME/.lesskey is used; on  MS-DOS  systems,  $HOME/_lesskey  is  used;  and  on  OS/2  systems
       $HOME/lesskey.ini  is  used,  or  $INIT/lesskey.ini  if $HOME is undefined.  The output file is a binary file
       which is used by less.  If no output file is specified, and the environment  variable  LESSKEY  is  set,  the
       value  of LESSKEY is used as the name of the output file.  Otherwise, a standard filename is used as the name
       of the output file, which depends on the system being used: On Unix and OS-9 systems, $HOME/.less is used; on
       MS-DOS  systems, $HOME/_less is used; and on OS/2 systems, $HOME/less.ini is used, or $INIT/less.ini if $HOME
       is undefined.  If the output file already exists, lesskey will overwrite it.

       The -V or --version option causes lesskey to print its version number and immediately exit.  If -V or  --ver‐
       sion is present, other options and arguments are ignored.

       The input file consists of one or more sections.  Each section starts with a line that identifies the type of
       section.  Possible sections are:

       #command
              Defines new command keys.

       #line-edit
              Defines new line-editing keys.

       #env   Defines environment variables.

       Blank lines and lines which start with a pound sign (#) are ignored, except for the  special  section  header
       lines.


COMMAND SECTION
       The command section begins with the line

       #command

       If  the command section is the first section in the file, this line may be omitted.  The command section con‐
       sists of lines of the form:

            string <whitespace> action [extra-string] <newline>

       Whitespace is any sequence of one or more spaces and/or tabs.  The string is the command key(s) which  invoke
       the  action.  The string may be a single command key, or a sequence of up to 15 keys.  The action is the name
       of the less action, from the list below.  The characters in the string may appear literally, or  be  prefixed
       by a caret to indicate a control key.  A backslash followed by one to three octal digits may be used to spec‐
       ify a character by its octal value.  A backslash followed by certain characters specifies input characters as
       follows:

       \b     BACKSPACE

       \e     ESCAPE

       \n     NEWLINE

       \r     RETURN

       \t     TAB

       \ku    UP ARROW

       \kd    DOWN ARROW

       \kr    RIGHT ARROW

       \kl    LEFT ARROW

       \kU    PAGE UP

       \kD    PAGE DOWN

       \kh    HOME

       \ke    END

       \kx    DELETE

       A  backslash  followed  by any other character indicates that character is to be taken literally.  Characters
       which must be preceded by backslash include caret, space, tab and the backslash itself.

       An action may be followed by an "extra" string.  When such a command  is  entered  while  running  less,  the
       action  is performed, and then the extra string is parsed, just as if it were typed in to less.  This feature
       can be used in certain cases to extend the functionality of a command.  For example, see  the  "{"  and  ":t"
       commands  in  the  example  below.   The  extra string has a special meaning for the "quit" action: when less
       quits, first character of the extra string is used as its exit status.


EXAMPLE
       The following input file describes the set of default command keys used by less:

            :Q        quit
            ZZ        quit


PRECEDENCE
       Commands specified by lesskey take precedence over the default commands.  A default command key may  be  dis‐
       abled by including it in the input file with the action "invalid".  Alternatively, a key may be defined to do
       nothing by using the action "noaction".  "noaction" is similar to "invalid", but less will give an error beep
       for  an  "invalid"  command, but not for a "noaction" command.  In addition, ALL default commands may be dis‐
       abled by adding this control line to the input file:

       #stop

       This will cause all default commands to be ignored.  The #stop line should be the last line in  that  section
       of the file.

       Be  aware  that #stop can be dangerous.  Since all default commands are disabled, you must provide sufficient
       commands before the #stop line to enable all necessary actions.  For example, failure  to  provide  a  "quit"
       command can lead to frustration.


LINE EDITING SECTION
       The line-editing section begins with the line:

       #line-edit

       This  section  specifies  new  key bindings for the line editing commands, in a manner similar to the way key
       bindings for ordinary commands are specified in the #command section.  The line-editing section consists of a
       list of keys and actions, one per line as in the example below.


EXAMPLE
       The following input file describes the set of default line-editing keys used by less:

            #line-edit
            \t        forw-complete
            \17       back-complete
            \e\t      back-complete
            ^L        expand
            ^V        literal
            ^A        literal
            \el       right
            \kr       right
            \eh       left
            \kl       left
            \eb       word-left
            \e\kl     word-left
            \ew       word-right
            \e\kr     word-right
            \ei       insert
            \ex       delete
            \kx       delete
            \eX       word-delete
            \ekx      word-delete
            \e\b      word-backspace
            \e0       home
            \kh       home
            \e$       end
            \ke       end
            \ek       up
            \ku       up
            \ej       down
            ^G        abort



LESS ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES
       The environment variable section begins with the line

       #env

       Following  this  line  is  a  list of environment variable assignments.  Each line consists of an environment
       variable name, an equals sign (=) and the value to be assigned to  the  environment  variable.   White  space
       before  and after the equals sign is ignored.  Variables assigned in this way are visible only to less.  If a
       variable is specified in the system environment and also in a lesskey file, the value  in  the  lesskey  file
       takes  precedence.   Although  the lesskey file can be used to override variables set in the environment, the
       main purpose of assigning variables in the lesskey file is simply to have all less configuration  information
       stored in one file.


EXAMPLE
       The  following  input  file  sets  the  -i option whenever less is run, and specifies the character set to be
       "latin1":

            #env
            LESS = -i
            LESSCHARSET = latin1

WARNINGS
       On MS-DOS and OS/2 systems, certain keys send a sequence of characters which start with a NUL character  (0).
       This NUL character should be represented as \340 in a lesskey file.
