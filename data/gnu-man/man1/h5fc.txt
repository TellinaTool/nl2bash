FORTRAN(1)                                          User Commands                                         FORTRAN(1)



NAME
       Fortran - Reports statistics regarding an HDF5 file and the objects in the file.

DESCRIPTION
       usage: h5fc [OPTIONS] <compile line>

              OPTIONS:

       -help  This help message.

       -echo  Show all the shell commands executed

       -prefix=DIR
              Prefix directory to find HDF5 lib/ and include/

              subdirectories [default: /usr]

       -show  Show the commands without executing them

       -showconfig
              Show the HDF5 library configuration summary

       -shlib Compile with shared HDF5 libraries

       -noshlib
              Compile with static HDF5 libraries [default]

       <compile line>
              - the normal compile line options for your compiler.

              h5fc  uses  the  same compiler you used to compile HDF5. Check with your compiler's man pages for more
              information on which options are needed.

              You can override the compiler and linker to compile your program by setting the following  environment
              variables accordingly:

       HDF5_FC
              -  use a different Fortran 90 or 95 compiler

       HDF5_FLINKER
              -  use a different linker

       HDF5_USE_SHLIB=[yes|no]
              -  use shared or static version of the HDF5 library

              [default: no]

              You  can  also add or change paths and flags to the compile line using the following environment vari‐
              bles or by assigning them to their counterparts in the 'Things You Can Modify to Override...'  section
              of h5fc

       Variable
              Current value to be replaced

       HDF5_FFLAGS
              ""

       HDF5_LDFLAGS
              ""

       HDF5_LIBS
              ""

              Note  that  adding  library  paths to HDF5_LDFLAGS where another hdf5 version is located may link your
              program with that other hdf5 library version.
