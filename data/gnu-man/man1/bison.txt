NAME
       bison - GNU Project parser generator (yacc replacement)

SYNOPSIS
       bison [OPTION]... FILE

DESCRIPTION
       Bison  is  a  parser  generator  in  the style of yacc(1).  It should be upwardly compatible with input files
       designed for yacc.

       Input files should follow the yacc convention of ending in .y.  Unlike yacc, the generated files do not  have
       fixed  names,  but  instead  use  the prefix of the input file.  Moreover, if you need to put C++ code in the
       input file, you can end his name by a C++-like extension (.ypp or .y++), then bison will follow  your  exten‐
       sion  to name the output file (.cpp or .c++).  For instance, a grammar description file named parse.yxx would
       produce the generated parser in a file named parse.tab.cxx, instead of yacc's y.tab.c or old Bison  version's
       parse.tab.c.

       This  description  of  the  options  that  can  be  given to bison is adapted from the node Invocation in the
       bison.texi manual, which should be taken as authoritative.

       Bison supports both traditional single-letter options and mnemonic long option names.  Long option names  are
       indicated with -- instead of -.  Abbreviations for option names are allowed as long as they are unique.  When
       a long option takes an argument, like --file-prefix, connect the option name and the argument with =.

       Generate a deterministic LR or generalized LR (GLR) parser employing LALR(1),  IELR(1),  or  canonical  LR(1)
       parser tables.  IELR(1) and canonical LR(1) support is experimental.

       Mandatory arguments to long options are mandatory for short options too.  The same is true for optional argu‐
       ments.

   Operation modes:
       -h, --help
              display this help and exit

       -V, --version
              output version information and exit

       --print-localedir
              output directory containing locale-dependent data

       --print-datadir
              output directory containing skeletons and XSLT

       -y, --yacc
              emulate POSIX Yacc

       -W, --warnings[=CATEGORY]
              report the warnings falling in CATEGORY

       -f, --feature[=FEATURE]
              activate miscellaneous features

   Parser:
       -L, --language=LANGUAGE
              specify the output programming language

       -S, --skeleton=FILE
              specify the skeleton to use

       -t, --debug
              instrument the parser for tracing same as '-Dparse.trace'

       --locations
              enable location support

       -D, --define=NAME[=VALUE]
              similar to '%define NAME "VALUE"'

       -F, --force-define=NAME[=VALUE]
              override '%define NAME "VALUE"'

       -p, --name-prefix=PREFIX
              prepend PREFIX to the external symbols deprecated by '-Dapi.prefix=PREFIX'

       -l, --no-lines
              don't generate '#line' directives

       -k, --token-table
              include a table of token names

   Output:
       --defines[=FILE]
              also produce a header file

       -d     likewise but cannot specify FILE (for POSIX Yacc)

       -r, --report=THINGS
              also produce details on the automaton

       --report-file=FILE
              write report to FILE

       -v, --verbose
              same as '--report=state'

       -b, --file-prefix=PREFIX
              specify a PREFIX for output files

       -o, --output=FILE
              leave output to FILE

       -g, --graph[=FILE]
              also output a graph of the automaton

       -x, --xml[=FILE]
              also output an XML report of the automaton (the XML schema is experimental)

   Warning categories include:
       'midrule-values'
              unset or unused midrule values

       'yacc' incompatibilities with POSIX Yacc

       'conflicts-sr'
              S/R conflicts (enabled by default)

       'conflicts-rr'
              R/R conflicts (enabled by default)

       'deprecated'
              obsolete constructs

       'empty-rule'
              empty rules without %empty

       'precedence'
              useless precedence and associativity

       'other'
              all other warnings (enabled by default)

       'all'  all the warnings except 'yacc'

       'no-CATEGORY'
              turn off warnings in CATEGORY

       'none' turn off all the warnings

       'error[=CATEGORY]'
              treat warnings as errors

   THINGS is a list of comma separated words that can include:
       'state'
              describe the states

       'itemset'
              complete the core item sets with their closure

       'lookahead'
              explicitly associate lookahead tokens to items

       'solved'
              describe shift/reduce conflicts solving
