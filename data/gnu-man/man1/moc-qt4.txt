moc(1)                                         General Commands Manual                                        moc(1)



NAME
       moc - generate Qt meta object support code

SYNOPSIS
       moc [-o file] [-i] [-f] [-k] [-ldbg] [-nw] [-p path] [-q path] [-v] file

DESCRIPTION
       This  page documents the Meta Object Compiler for the Qt GUI application framework. The moc reads one or more
       C++ class declarations from a C++ header or source file and generates one C++  source  file  containing  meta
       object information for the classes. The C++ source file generated by the moc must be compiled and linked with
       the implementation of the class (or it can be #included into the class's source file).

       If you use qmake to create your Makefiles, build rules will be included that call the moc when  required,  so
       you will not need to use the moc directly.

       In  brief,  the  meta  object  system  is a structure used by Qt (see http://doc.trolltech.com) for component
       programming and run time type information.  It adds properties and inheritance information to (some)  classes
       and provides a new type of communication between those instances of those classes, signal-slot connections.

OPTIONS
       -o file
              Write output to file rather than to stdout.

       -f     Force the generation of an #include statement in the output.  This is the default for files whose name
              matches the regular expression .[hH][^.]* (i.e. the extension starts with H or h  ).  This  option  is
              only useful if you have header files that do not follow the standard naming conventions.

       -i     Do  not  generate  an  #include  statement  in  the output.  This may be used to run moc on a C++ file
              containing one or more class declarations. You should then #include the meta object code in  the  .cpp
              file (see USAGE below).  If both -f and -i are present, the last one wins.

       -nw    Do not generate any warnings. Not recommended.

       -ldbg  Write a flood of lex debug information to stdout.

       -p path
              Makes moc prepend path/ to the file name in the generated #include statement (if one is generated).

       -q path
              Makes moc prepend path/ to the file name of qt #include files in the generated code.

       -v     Displays the version of moc and Qt.

       You  can explicitly tell the moc not to parse parts of a header file. It recognizes any C++ comment (//) that
       contains the substrings MOC_SKIP_BEGIN or MOC_SKIP_END. They work as  you  would  expect  and  you  can  have
       several  levels  of  them.  The  net  result  as seen by the moc is as if you had removed all lines between a
       MOC_SKIP_BEGIN and a MOC_SKIP_END

USAGE
       moc is almost always invoked by make(1), not by hand.

       moc is typically used with an input file containing class declarations like this:

           class YourClass : public QObject {
               Q_OBJECT
               Q_PROPERTY( ... )
               Q_CLASSINFO( ... )

           public:
               YourClass( QObject * parent=0, const char * name=0 );
               ~YourClass();

           signals:

           public slots:

           };

       Here is a useful makefile rule if you only use GNU make:

           m%.cpp: %.h
                   moc $< -o $@

       If you want to write portably, you can use individual rules of the following form:

           mNAME.cpp: NAME.h
                   moc $< -o $@

       You must also remember to add mNAME.cpp to your SOURCES (substitute your favorite name) variable and  mNAME.o
       to your OBJECTS variable.

       (While  we  prefer to name our C++ source files .cpp, the moc doesn't know that, so you can use .C, .cc, .CC,
       .cxx or even .c++ if you prefer.)

       If you have class declarations in C++ files, we recommend that you use a makefile rule like this:

           NAME.o: mNAME.cpp

           mNAME.cpp: NAME.cpp
                   moc -i $< -o $@

       This guarantees that make(1) will run the moc before it compiles NAME.cpp.  You can then put

           #include "nNAME.cpp"

       at the end of NAME.cpp, where all the classes declared in that file are fully known.

DIAGNOSTICS
       Sometimes you may get linkage errors, saying that YourClass::className() is undefined or that YourClass lacks
       a vtbl.  Those errors happen most often when you forget to compile the moc-generated C++ code or include that
       object file in the link command.

       The moc will warn you about a number of dangerous or illegal constructs.

BUGS
       The moc does not expand #include or #define, it simply skips any preprocessor directives it encounters.  This
       is regrettable, but is normally not a problem in practice.

       The  moc  does not handle all of C++.  The main problem is that class templates cannot have signals or slots.
       This is an important bug.  Here is an example:

           class SomeTemplate<int> : public QFrame {
               Q_OBJECT
               ....
           signals:
               void bugInMocDetected( int );
           };

       Less importantly, the following constructs are illegal.  All of them have have alternatives  which  we  think
       are usually better, so removing these limitations is not a high priority for us.

   Multiple inheritance requires QObject to be first.
       If  you  are using multiple inheritance, moc assumes that the first inherited class is a subclass of QObject.
       Also, be sure that only the first inherited class is a QObject.

           class SomeClass : public QObject, public OtherClass {
               ...
           };

       This bug is almost impossible to fix; since the moc does not expand #include or #define, it cannot  find  out
       which one of the base classes is a QObject.

   Function pointers cannot be arguments to signals or slots.
       In  most  cases  where  you  would  consider  that, we think inheritance is a better alternative.  Here is an
       example of illegal syntax:

           class SomeClass : public QObject {
               Q_OBJECT
               ...
           public slots:
               // illegal
               void apply( void (*apply)(List *, void *), void * );
           };

       You can work around this restriction like this:

           typedef void (*ApplyFunctionType)( List *, void * );

           class SomeClass : public QObject {
               Q_OBJECT
               ...
           public slots:
               void apply( ApplyFunctionType, char * );
           };

       It may sometimes be even better to replace the function  pointer  with  inheritance  and  virtual  functions,
       signals or slots.

   Friend declarations cannot be placed in signals or slots sections
       Sometimes  it  will  work, but in general, friend declarations cannot be placed in signals or slots sections.
       Put them in the good old private, protected or public sections instead.  Here is an example  of  the  illegal
       syntax:

           class SomeClass : public QObject {
               Q_OBJECT
               ...
           signals:
               friend class ClassTemplate<char>; // illegal
           };

   Signals and slots cannot be upgraded
       The  C++  feature of upgrading an inherited member function to public status is not extended to cover signals
       and slots.  Here is an illegal example:

           class Whatever : public QButtonGroup {
               ...
           public slots:
               QButtonGroup::buttonPressed; // illegal
               ...
           };

       The QButtonGroup::buttonPressed() slot is protected.

       C++ quiz: What happens if you try to upgrade a protected member function which is overloaded?

              - All the functions are upgraded.

              - That is not legal C++.

   Type macros cannot be used for signal and slot arguments
       Since the moc does not expand #define, type macros that take an argument will not work in signals and  slots.
       Here is an illegal example:

           #ifdef ultrix
           #define SIGNEDNESS(a) unsigned a
           #else
           #define SIGNEDNESS(a) a
           #endif
           class Whatever : public QObject {
               ...
           signals:
               void someSignal( SIGNEDNESS(int) ); // illegal
           };

       A #define without arguments works.

   Nested classes cannot be in the signals or slots sections nor have signals or slots
       Here's an example:

           class A {
               Q_OBJECT
           public:
               class B {
               public slots: // illegal
                   void b();
                   ...
               };
           signals:
               class B {  // illegal
                   void b();
                ...
               }:
           };

   Constructors cannot be used in signals or slots sections
       It is a mystery to us why anyone would put a constructor on either the signals or slots sections.  You can't,
       anyway (except that it happens to work in some cases).  Put them in private, protected  or  public  sections,
       where they belong.  Here is an example of the illegal syntax:

           class SomeClass : public QObject {
               Q_OBJECT
           public slots:
               SomeClass( QObject *parent, const char *name )
                   : QObject( parent, name ) {} // illegal
               ...
           };

   Properties need to be declared before the public section that contains the respective get and set functions
       Declaring  the  first  property  within or after the public section that contains the type definition and the
       respective get and set functions does not work as expected. The moc will complain that it  can  neither  find
       the functions nor resolve the type. Here is an example of the illegal syntax:

           class SomeClass : public QObject {
               Q_OBJECT
           public:
               ...
               // illegal
               Q_PROPERTY( Priority priority READ priority WRITE setPriority )
               Q_ENUMS( Priority )
               enum Priority { High, Low, VeryHigh, VeryLow };
               void setPriority( Priority );
               Priority priority() const;
               ...
           };

       Work  around  this  limitation  by  declaring all properties at the beginning of the class declaration, right
       after Q_OBJECT:

           class SomeClass : public QObject {
               Q_OBJECT
               Q_PROPERTY( Priority priority READ priority WRITE setPriority )
               Q_ENUMS( Priority )
           public:
               ...
               enum Priority { High, Low, VeryHigh, VeryLow };
               void setPriority( Priority );
               Priority priority() const;
               ...
           };
