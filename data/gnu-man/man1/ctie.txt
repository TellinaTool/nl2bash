CTIE(1)                                        General Commands Manual                                       CTIE(1)



NAME
       ctie - merge or apply CWEB change files

SYNOPSIS
       ctie -c|-m outputfile masterfile changefile...

DESCRIPTION
       The ctie program is used to process multiple change files used with the CWEB system for literate programming.
       The CWEB programs allow one to apply patches to a source file (the masterfile) by means of  a  single  change
       file.   ctie  can  be used to either merge up to 32 change files into a single one or to apply the changes to
       the masterfile in order to create a new master file.  Output of either the new change  file  or  the  patched
       master file goes into outputfile.  Any include files (indicated using the CWEB @i command) are fully expanded
       during ctie processing, which means that the change files are able to modify the  contents  of  any  included
       files.

OPTIONS
       -c     Create a single change file from the given changefiles.

       -m     Create a new master file by applying the given changefiles.

ENVIRONMENT
       The  environment  variable CWEBINPUTS is used to search for the input files, or the system default if CWEBIN‐
       PUTS is not set.  See tex(1) for the details of the searching.
