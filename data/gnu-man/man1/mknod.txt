NAME
       mknod - make block or character special files

SYNOPSIS
       mknod [OPTION]... NAME TYPE [MAJOR MINOR]

DESCRIPTION
       Create the special file NAME of the given TYPE.

       Mandatory arguments to long options are mandatory for short options too.

       -m, --mode=MODE
              set file permission bits to MODE, not a=rw - umask

       -Z, --context=CTX
              set the SELinux security context of NAME to CTX

       --help display this help and exit

       --version
              output version information and exit

       Both  MAJOR and MINOR must be specified when TYPE is b, c, or u, and they must be omitted when TYPE is p.  If
       MAJOR or MINOR begins with 0x or 0X, it is interpreted as hexadecimal; otherwise, if it  begins  with  0,  as
       octal; otherwise, as decimal.  TYPE may be:

       b      create a block (buffered) special file

       c, u   create a character (unbuffered) special file

       p      create a FIFO

       NOTE:  your  shell  may  have  its own version of mknod, which usually supersedes the version described here.
       Please refer to your shell's documentation for details about the options it supports.
