NAME
       dvicopy, odvicopy - produce modified copy of DVI file

SYNOPSIS
       dvicopy [options] [infile[.dvi] [outfile[.dvi]]]

DESCRIPTION
       This  manual  page  is not meant to be exhaustive.  The complete documentation for this version of TeX can be
       found in the info file or manual Web2C: A TeX implementation.

       dvicopy reads a DVI file, expands any references to virtual fonts to base fonts, and writes the resulting DVI
       file.   Thus you can use virtual fonts even if your DVI processor does not support them, by passing the docu‐
       ments through dvicopy first.

OPTIONS
       -magnification=NUMBER
              Override existing magnification with NUMBER.

       -max-pages=NUMBER
              Process NUMBER pages; default one million.

       -page-start=PAGE-SPEC
              Start at PAGE-SPEC, for example `2' or `5.*.-2'.

SEE ALSO
       dviselect(1), dvitype(1).
