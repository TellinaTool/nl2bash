NAME
       derb - disassemble a resource bundle

SYNOPSIS
       derb  [  -h,  -?,  --help  ]  [ -V, --version ] [ -v, --verbose ] [ -e, --encoding encoding ] [ --bom ] [ -l,
       --locale locale ] [ -t, --truncate [ size ] ] [ -s, --sourcedir source ] [ -d, --destdir destination ] [  -i,
       --icudatadir directory ] [ -c, --to-stdout ] bundle ...

DESCRIPTION
       derb  reads  the  compiled resource bundle files passed on the command line and write them back in text form.
       The resulting text files have a .txt extension while compiled resource bundle source files typically  have  a
       .res extension.

       It  is  customary  to  name the resource bundles by their locale name, i.e. to use a local identifier for the
       bundle filename, e.g.  ja_JP.res for Japanese (Japan) data, or root.res for the root bundle.  This  is  espe‐
       cially important for derb since the locale name is not accessible directly from the compiled resource bundle,
       and to know which locale to ask for when opening the bundle.  derb will produce a file  whose  base  name  is
       either  the  value  of  the  -l,  --locale option, or the same as the base name of the compiled resource file
       itself.  If the --to-stdout, -c option is used, however, the text will be written on the standard output.

OPTIONS
       -h, -?, --help
              Print help about usage and exit.

       -V, --version
              Print the version of derb and exit.

       -v, --verbose
              Display extra informative messages during execution.

       -e, --encoding encoding
              Set the encoding used to write output files to encoding.  The default encoding is the invariant  (sub‐
              set of ASCII or EBCDIC) codepage for the system (see section INVARIANT CHARACTERS).  The choice of the
              encoding does not affect the data, just their representation. Characters that cannot be represented in
              the encoding will be represented using \uhhhh escape sequences.

       --bom  Write a byte order mark (BOM) at the beginning of the file.

       -l, --locale locale
              Set  the locale for the resource bundle, which is used both in the generated text and as the base name
              of the output file.

       -t, --truncate [ size ]
              Truncate individual resources (strings or binary data) to size bytes. The default if size is not spec‐
              ified is 80 bytes.

       -s, --sourcedir source
              Set  the  source directory to source.  The default source directory is the current directory.  If - is
              passed for source, then the bundle will be looked for  in  its  default  location,  specified  by  the
              ICU_DATA environment variable (or defaulting to the location set when ICU was built if ICU_DATA is not
              set).

       -d, --destdir destination
              Set the destination directory to destination.  The default destination directory is specified  by  the
              environment variable ICU_DATA or is the location set when ICU was built if ICU_DATA is not set.

       -i, --icudatadir directory
              Look for any necessary ICU data files in directory.  For example, when processing collation overrides,
              the file ucadata.dat must be located.  The default ICU data directory is specified by the  environment
              variable ICU_DATA.

       -c, --to-stdout
              Write the disassembled bundle on standard output instead of into a file.

CAVEATS
       When  the  option  --bom  is  used, the character U+FEFF is written in the destination encoding regardless of
       whether it is a Unicode transformation format (UTF) or not.  This option should only  be  used  with  an  UTF
       encoding, as byte order marks are not meaningful for other encodings.

INVARIANT CHARACTERS
       The  invariant character set consists of the following set of characters, expressed as a standard POSIX regu‐
       lar expression: [a-z]|[A-Z]|[0-9]|_| |+|-|*|/.  This is the set which is guaranteed to be  available  regard‐
       less of code page.

ENVIRONMENT
       ICU_DATA  Specifies  the directory containing ICU data. Defaults to ${prefix}/share/icu/52.1/.  Some tools in
                 ICU depend on the presence of the trailing slash. It is thus important to  make  sure  that  it  is
                 present if ICU_DATA is set.
