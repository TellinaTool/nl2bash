NAME
       stty - change and print terminal line settings

SYNOPSIS
       stty [-F DEVICE | --file=DEVICE] [SETTING]...
       stty [-F DEVICE | --file=DEVICE] [-a|--all]
       stty [-F DEVICE | --file=DEVICE] [-g|--save]

DESCRIPTION
       Print or change terminal characteristics.

       Mandatory arguments to long options are mandatory for short options too.

       -a, --all
              print all current settings in human-readable form

       -g, --save
              print all current settings in a stty-readable form

       -F, --file=DEVICE
              open and use the specified DEVICE instead of stdin

       --help display this help and exit

       --version
              output version information and exit

       Optional  - before SETTING indicates negation.  An * marks non-POSIX settings.  The underlying system defines
       which settings are available.

       deviations  from stty sane.  In settings, CHAR is taken literally, or coded as in ^c, 0x37, 0177 or 127; spe‐
       cial values ^- or undef used to disable special characters.
