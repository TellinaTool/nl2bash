ASPELL(1)                                 Aspell Abbreviated User's Manual                                 ASPELL(1)



NAME
       aspell - interactive spell checker

SYNOPSIS
       aspell [options] <command>

DESCRIPTION
       aspell  is  a  utility  program  that  connects to the Aspell library so that it can function as an ispell -a
       replacement, as an independent spell checker, as a test utility to test out Aspell library features, and as a
       utility for managing dictionaries used by the library.

       The Aspell library contains an interface allowing other programs direct access to its functions and therefore
       reducing the complex task of spell checking to simple library calls.  The default library  does  not  contain
       dictionary  word lists.  To add language dictionaries, please check your distro first for modified dictionar‐
       ies, otherwise look here for base language dictionaries <http://aspell.net>.

       The following information describes the commands and options used by the Aspell Utility.

       This manual page is maintained separately from the official documentation so it may be out of date or  incom‐
       plete.   The  official  documentation  is maintained as a Texinfo manual.  See the `aspell' entry in info for
       more complete documentation.

DICTIONARY OPTIONS
       The following options may be used to control which dictionaries to use and how they behave.

       --master=<name>, -d <name>
              Base name of the dictionary to use.  If this option is specified then Aspell will either use this dic‐
              tionary or die.

       --dict-dir=<directory>
              Location of the main dictionary word list.

       --lang=<string>, -l <string>
              Language  to  use.   It follows the same format of the LANG environmental variable on most systems. It
              consists of the two letter ISO 639 language code and an optional two  letter  ISO  3166  country  code
              after a dash or underscore. The default value is based on the value of the LC_MESSAGES locale.

       --size=<string>
              The preferred size of the dictionary word list.  This consists of a two char digit code describing the
              size of the list, with typical values of: 10=tiny, 20=really small,  30=small,  40=med-small,  50=med,
              60=med-large, 70=large, 80=huge, 90=insane.

       --variety=<string>
              Any extra information to distinguish this variety of dictionary from other dictionaries which may have
              the same lang and size.

       --jargon=<string>
              Please use the variety option since it replaces jargon as a better choice.  jargon will be removed  in
              the future.

       --word-list-path=<list of directories>
              Search path for word list information files.

       --personal=<file>, -p <file>

              Extra dictionaries to use.

       --ignore-accents
              This option is not yet implemented.

              Ignore case when checking words.

       --ignore-repl, --dont-ignore-repl

              Add or remove a filter.

       --add-filter-path=<paths>, --rem-filter-path=<paths>
              Add or remove paths searched for filters.

       --mode=<string>, -e, -H, -t, -n
              Sets  the filter mode.  Mode is one of none, url, email, html, tex or nroff.  The alternative shortcut
              options are '-e' for email, '-H' for Html/Sgml, '-t' for Tex or '-n' for Nroff.

       --encoding=<string>
              encoding the document is expected to be in.  The default depends on the current locale.

MISC OPTIONS
       Miscellaneous options that don't fall under any other category.

       --conf=<file name>
              Main configuration file.  This file overrides Aspell's global defaults.

       --conf-dir=<directory>
              Location of main configuration file.

       --data-dir=<directory>
              Location of language data files.

       --keyboard=<keyboard>
              Use this keyboard layout for suggesting possible words.  These spelling errors happen if a user  acci‐
              dently presses a key next to the intended correct key.

       --local-data-dir=<directory>
              Alternative location of language data files.  This directory is searched before data-dir.

       --home-dir=<directory>
              Directory Location for personal wordlist files.

       --per-conf=<file name>
              Personal configuration file.  This file overrides options found in the global config file.

ASPELL UTILITY OPTIONS
       These options are part of the aspell Utility and work independently of the library.

       --backup, --dont-backup, -b, -x
              The  aspell utility creates a backup file by making a copy and appending .bak to file name.  This only
              applies when the command is check <file> and the backup file is only created if any spelling modifica‐
              tions take place.

       --byte-offsets, --dont-byte-offsets
              Use byte offsets instead of character offsets.

       --guess, --dont-guess, -m, -P
              Create missing root/affix combinations not in the dictionary in pipe mode.

       --keymapping=aspell, --keymapping=ispell
              The  keymapping  to  use, either aspell for the default mapping or ispell to use the same mapping that
              the Ispell utility uses.

       --reverse, --dont-reverse
              Reverse the order of the suggestions list in pipe mode.

       --suggest, --dont-suggest
              Suggest possible replacements in pipe mode. If false, Aspell will simply report  the  misspelling  and
              make no attempt at suggestions or possible corrections.

       --time, --dont-time
              Time the load time and suggest a time in pipe mode.

       In  addition  Aspell will try to make sense out of Ispell's command line options so that it can function as a
       drop in replacement for Ispell.  If Aspell is run without any command line options it will  display  a  brief
       help screen and quit.

CONFIGURATION
       Aspell  can accept options via global or personal configuration files so that you do not need to specify them
       each time at the command line.  The default global configuration file is  /etc/aspell.conf  or  another  file
       specified  by  option  --conf  and  is checked first.  The default per user configuration file ~/.aspell.conf
       located in the $HOME directory (or another file specified by option --per-conf) is checked next and overrides
       options  set in the global config file.  Options specified at either the command line or via an environmental
       variable override those specified by either configuration file.

       Each line of the configuration file has the format:

              option [value]

       where option is any one of the standard library options above without the leading dashes.   For  example  the
       following line will set the default language to Swiss German:

              lang de_CH

       There may be any number of spaces between the option and the value, however it can only be spaces, i.e. there
       is no '=' between the option name and the value.  Comments may also be included by preceding them with a  '#'
       as  anything from a '#' to a newline is ignored.  Blank lines are also allowed.  The /etc/aspell.conf file is
       a good example of how to set these options and the Aspell Manual has more detailed info.

       tation.

SUPPORT
       Support  for  Aspell  can be found on the Aspell mailing lists.  Instructions for joining the various mailing
       lists (and an archive of them) can be found off the Aspell home page  at  <http://aspell.net>.   Bug  reports
       should be submitted via the Sourceforge Tracker rather than being posted to the mailing lists.
