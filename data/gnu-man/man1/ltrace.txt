DESCRIPTION
       ltrace  is  a  program  that simply runs the specified command until it exits.  It intercepts and records the
       dynamic library calls which are called by the executed process and the signals which  are  received  by  that
       process.  It can also intercept and print the system calls executed by the program.

       Its use is very similar to strace(1).


OPTIONS
       -a, --align column
              Align return values in a specific column (default column is 5/8 of screen width).

       -A maxelts
              Maximum  number of array elements to print before suppressing the rest with an ellipsis ("...").  This
              also limits number of recursive structure expansions.

       -b, --no-signals
              Disable printing of signals recieved by the traced process.

       -c     Count time and calls for each library call and report a summary on program exit.

       -C, --demangle
              Decode (demangle) low-level symbol names into user-level names.  Besides removing any  initial  under‐
              score prefix used by the system, this makes C++ function names readable.

       -D, --debug mask
              Show debugging output of ltrace itself.  mask is a number with internal meaning that's not really well
              defined at all.  mask of 77 shows all debug messages, which is what you usually need.

       -e filter
              A qualifying expression which modifies which library calls to trace.  The format of the filter expres‐
              sion  is  described in the section FILTER EXPRESSIONS.  If more than one -e option appears on the com‐
              mand line, the library calls that match any of them are traced.  If no -e is given, @MAIN  is  assumed
              as a default.

       -f     Trace  child processes as they are created by currently traced processes as a result of the fork(2) or
              clone(2) system calls.  The new process is attached immediately.

       -F filename
              Load an alternate config file. Normally, /etc/ltrace.conf and ~/.ltrace.conf will be read (the  latter
              only  if  it  exists).   Use  this option to load the given file or files instead of those two default
              files.  See ltrace.conf(5) for details on the syntax of ltrace configuration files.

       -h, --help
              Show a summary of the options to ltrace and exit.

       -i     Print the instruction pointer at the time of the library call.

       -l, --library library_pattern
              Display only calls to functions implemented by libraries that match library_pattern.  Multiple library
              patters  can  be  specified  with  several  instances  of  this  option.  Syntax of library_pattern is
              described in section FILTER EXPRESSIONS.

              Note that while this option selects calls that might be directed to the selected libraries, there's no
              actual guarantee that the call won't be directed elsewhere due to e.g. LD_PRELOAD or simply dependency
              ordering.  If you want to make sure that  symbols  in  given  library  are  actually  called,  use  -x
              @library_pattern instead.

       -L     When no -e option is given, don't assume the default action of @MAIN.

       -n, --indent nr
              Indent  trace  output by nr spaces for each level of call nesting. Using this option makes the program
              flow visualization easy to follow.  This indents uselessly also functions that never return,  such  as
              service functions for throwing exceptions in the C++ runtime.

       -o, --output filename
              Write the trace output to the file filename rather than to stderr.

       -p pid Attach  to  the  process  with the process ID pid and begin tracing.  This option can be used together
              with passing a command to execute.  It is possible to attach to several processes by passing more than
              one option -p.

       -r     Print  a relative timestamp with each line of the trace.  This records the time difference between the
              beginning of successive lines.

       -s strsize
              Specify the maximum string size to print (the default is 32).

       -S     Display system calls as well as library calls

       -t     Prefix each line of the trace with the time of day.

       -tt    If given twice, the time printed will include the microseconds.

       -ttt   If given thrice, the time printed will include the  microseconds  and  the  leading  portion  will  be
              printed as the number of seconds since the epoch.

       -T     Show   the   time   spent inside each call. This records the time difference between the beginning and
              the end of each call.

       -u username
              Run command with the userid, groupid and supplementary groups of username.  This option is only useful
              when running as root and enables the correct execution of setuid and/or setgid binaries.

       -w, --where nr
              Show backtrace of nr stack frames for each traced function. This option enabled only if libunwind sup‐
              port was enabled at compile time.

       -x filter
              A qualifying expression which modifies which symbol table entry points to trace.  The  format  of  the
              filter  expression is described in the section FILTER EXPRESSIONS.  If more than one -x option appears
              on the command line, the symbols that match any of them are traced.  No entry points are traced if  no
              -x is given.

       -V, --version
              Show the version number of ltrace and exit.


FILTER EXPRESSIONS
       Filter  expression  is  a chain of glob- or regexp-based rules that are used to pick symbols for tracing from
       libraries that the process uses.  Most of it is intuitive, so as an example, the following would trace  calls
       to malloc and free, except those done by libc:

       -e malloc+free-@libc.so*

       This  reads: trace malloc and free, but don't trace anything that comes from libc.  Semi-formally, the syntax
       of the above example looks approximately like this:

       {[+-][symbol_pattern][@library_pattern]}

       Symbol_pattern is used to match symbol names, library_pattern to match library SONAMEs.  Both are  implicitly
       globs,  but can be regular expressions as well (see below).  The glob syntax supports meta-characters * and ?
       and character classes, similarly to what basic bash globs support.  ^ and $ are recognized to  mean,  respec‐
       tively, start and end of given name.

       Both  symbol_pattern and library_pattern have to match the whole name.  If you want to match only part of the
       name, surround it with one or two *'s as appropriate.  The exception is if the pattern is  not  mentioned  at
       all, in which case it's as if the corresponding pattern were *.  (So malloc is really malloc@* and @libc.* is
       really *@libc.*.)

       In libraries that don't have an explicit SONAME, basename is taken for SONAME.  That holds for main binary as
       well:  /bin/echo  has  an  implicit SONAME of echo.  In addition to that, special library pattern MAIN always
       matches symbols in the main binary and never a library with actual SONAME MAIN (use e.g. ^MAIN or [M]AIN  for
       that).

       If  the  symbol  or  library  pattern is surrounded in slashes (/like this/), then it is considered a regular
       expression instead.  As a shorthand, instead of writing /x/@/y/, you can write /x@y/.

       If the library pattern starts with a slash, it is not a SONAME expression, but  a  path  expression,  and  is
       matched against the library path name.

       The  first  rule  may lack a sign, in which case + is assumed.  If, on the other hand, the first rule has a -
       sign, it is as if there was another rule @ in front of it, which has the  effect  of  tracing  complement  of
       given rule.

       The above rules are used to construct the set of traced symbols.  Each candidate symbol is passed through the
       chain of above rules.  Initially, the symbol is unmarked.  If it matches a + rule, it becomes marked,  if  it
       matches  a - rule, it becomes unmarked again.  If, after applying all rules, the symbol is marked, it will be
       traced.


BUGS
       It has most of the bugs stated in strace(1).

       It only works on Linux and in a small subset of architectures.

       If you would like to report a bug, send a message to the mailing list (ltrace-devel@lists.alioth.debian.org),
       or use the reportbug(1) program if you are under the Debian GNU/Linux distribution.
