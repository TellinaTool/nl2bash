NAME
       pstops - shuffle pages in a PostScript file

SYNOPSIS
       pstops [ -q ] [ -b ] [ -wwidth ] [ -hheight ] [ -ppaper ] [ -dlwidth ] pagespecs [ infile [ outfile ] ]

DESCRIPTION
       Pstops  rearranges  pages  from  a PostScript document, creating a new PostScript file.  The input PostScript
       file should follow the Adobe Document Structuring Conventions.  Pstops can be used to perform a large  number
       of  arbitrary re-arrangements of Documents, including arranging for printing 2-up, 4-up, booklets, reversing,
       selecting front or back sides of documents, scaling, etc.

       pagespecs follow the syntax:

              pagespecs   = [modulo:]specs

              specs       = spec[+specs][,specs]

              spec        = [-]pageno[L][R][U][H][V][@scale][(xoff,yoff)]

       modulo is the number of pages in each block. The value of modulo should be greater than 0; the default  value
       is  1.   specs  are the page specifications for the pages in each block. The value of the pageno in each spec
       should be between 0 (for the first page in the block) and modulo-1 (for the last page in each  block)  inclu‐
       sive.   The  optional  dimensions xoff and yoff shift the page by the specified amount.  xoff and yoff are in
       PostScript's points, but may be followed by the units cm or in to convert to centimetres or  inches,  or  the
       flag w or h to specify as a multiple of the width or height.  The optional parameters L, R, U, H and V rotate
       the page left, right, or upside-down, and flip (mirror) page horizontally or vertically.  The optional  scale
       parameter  scales  the  page by the fraction specified.  If the optional minus sign is specified, the page is
       relative to the end of the document, instead of the start.

       If page specs are separated by + the pages will be merged into one page; if they are separated by , they will
       be on separate pages.  If there is only one page specification, with pageno zero, the pageno may be omitted.

       The shift, rotation, and scaling are applied to the PostScript transformation matrix in that order regardless
       of which order they appear on the command line.  The matrix accumulates the individual transformations.   The
       effect  on  the image is to first scale with respect to an origin at the lower left corner, then rotate about
       the same origin, and finally shift.

       The -w option gives the width which is used by the w dimension specifier, and the -h option gives the  height
       which  is  used by the h dimension specifier. These dimensions are also used (after scaling) to set the clip‐
       ping path for each page.  The -p option can be used as an alternative, to set the paper size to a0,  a1,  a2,
       a3, a4, a5, b5, letter, legal, tabloid, statement, executive, folio, quarto or 10x14.  The default paper size
       is a4.

       The -b option prevents any bind operators in the PostScript prolog from binding. This may be needed in  cases
       where complex multi-page re-arrangements are being done.

       The  -d  option draws a line around the border of each page, of the specified width.  If the lwidth parameter
       is omitted, a default linewidth of 1 point is assumed. The linewidth is relative to the original page  dimen‐
       sions, i.e. it is scaled up or down with the rest of the page.

       Pstops normally prints the page numbers of the pages re-arranged; the -q option suppresses this.

EXAMPLES
       This  section contains some sample re-arrangements. To put two pages on one sheet (of A4 paper), the pagespec
       to use is:

                                           "2:0L@.7(21cm,0)+1L@.7(21cm,14.85cm)"

       To select all of the odd pages in reverse order, use:

                                                           2:-0

       To re-arrange pages for printing 2-up booklets, use

                                          "4:-3L@.7(21cm,0)+0L@.7(21cm,14.85cm)"

       for the front sides, and

                                          "4:1L@.7(21cm,0)+-2L@.7(21cm,14.85cm)"

       for the reverse sides (or join them with a comma for duplex printing).
