LOCALEDEF(1)                                   General Commands Manual                                  LOCALEDEF(1)



NAME
       localedef - compile locale definition files

SYNOPSIS
       localedef [options] outputpath
       localedef --list-archive [options]
       localedef --delete-from-archive [options] localename ...
       localedef --add-to-archive [options] compiledpath
       localedef --version
       localedef --help
       localedef --usage

DESCRIPTION
       The localedef program reads the indicated charmap and input files, compiles them to a binary form quickly us‐
       able by the locale(7) functions in the C library, and places the output in outputpath.

       If outputpath contains a slash character ('/'), it is directly the name of the  output  directory.   In  this
       case, there is a separate output file for each locale category (LC_CTIME, LC_NUMERIC, and so on).

       Otherwise,  if  the  --no-archive option is used, outputpath is the name of a subdirectory in /usr/lib/locale
       where per-category compiled files are placed.

       Otherwise, outputpath is the name of a locale and the compiled locale data  is  added  to  the  archive  file
       /usr/lib/locale/locale-archive.

       In  any  case, localedef aborts if the directory in which it tries to write locale files has not already been
       created.

       If no charmapfile is given, the value POSIX is used by default.  If no inputfile is given, or if it is  given
       as a dash (-), localedef reads from standard input.

OPTIONS
       Most  options  can have either short or long forms.  If multiple short options are used, they can be combined
       in one word (for example, -cv is identical to -c -v).

       If a short option takes an argument, the argument can be given separately as the next word (-f  foo),  or  it
       can be written together with the option letter (-ffoo).  If a long option takes an argument, the argument can
       be given separately as the next word, or it can be written as option=argument (--charmap=foo).

   Operation selection options
       A few options direct localedef to do something else than compile  locale  definitions.   Only  one  of  these
       should be used at a time.

       --delete-from-archive
              Delete the named locales from the locale archive file.

       --list-archive
              List the locales contained in the locale archive file.

       --add-to-archive
              Add the compiledpath directories to the locale archive file.  The directories should have been created
              by previous runs of localedef, using --no-archive.

   Other options
       Some of the following options are only sensible for some operations; hopefully it is self-evident which ones.

       -f charmapfile, --charmap=charmapfile
              Specify the file that defines the symbolic character names that are used by the input  file.   If  the
              file is in the default directory for character maps, it is not necessary to specify the full pathname.
              This default directory is printed by localedef --help.

       -i inputfile, --inputfile=inputfile
              Specify the locale definition file to compile.  If inputfile is not absolute, localedef will also look
              in the directories specified by the environment variable I18NPATH and in the default directory for lo‐
              cale definition files.  This default directory is printed by localedef --help.

       -u repertoirefile, --repertoire-map=repertoirefile
              Read mappings from symbolic names to Unicode UCS4 values from repertoirefile.

       -A aliasfile, --alias-file=aliasfile
              Use aliasfile to look up aliases for locale names.  There is no default aliases file.

       --prefix=pathname
              Set prefix to be prepended to the full archive pathname.  By default, the prefix  is  empty.   Setting
              the prefix to foo, the archive would be placed in foo/usr/lib/locale/locale-archive.

       -c, --force
              Write the output files even if warnings were generated about the input file.

       --old-style
              Create old-style tables.

       -v, --verbose
              Generate extra warnings about errors that are normally ignored.

       --quiet
              Suppress all notifications and warnings, and report only fatal errors.

       --posix
              Conform strictly to POSIX.  Implies --verbose.  This option currently has no other effect.  Posix con‐
              formance is assumed if the environment variable POSIXLY_CORRECT is set.

       --replace
              Replace a locale in the locale archive file.  Without this option, if the locale  is  in  the  archive
              file already, an error occurs.

       --no-archive
              Do  not use the locale archive file, instead create outputpath as a subdirectory in the same directory
              as the locale archive file, and create separate output files for locale categories in it.

       --help Print a usage summary and exit.  Also prints the default paths used by localedef.

       --usage
              Print a short usage summary and exit.

       -V, --version
              Print the version number, license, and disclaimer of warranty for localedef.

ENVIRONMENT
       POSIXLY_CORRECT
              The --posix flag is assumed if this environment variable is set.

       I18NPATH
              A colon separated list of default directories for locale definition files.

FILES
       /usr/share/i18n/charmaps
              Usual default charmap path.

       /usr/share/i18n/locales
              Usual default path for locale source files.

       /usr/share/i18n/repertoiremaps
              Usual default repertoire map path.

       /usr/lib/locale/locale-archive
              Usual default locale archive location.

       outputpath/LC_COLLATE
              One of the output files.  It describes the rules for comparing strings in the locale's alphabet.

       outputpath/LC_CTYPE
              One of the output files.  It contains information about character cases and case conversions  for  the
              locale.

       outputpath/LC_MONETARY
              One of the output files.  It describes the way monetary values should be formatted in the locale.

       outputpath/LC_MESSAGES/SYS_LC_MESSAGES
              One  of  the  output files.  It contains information about the language messages should be printed in,
              and what an affirmative or negative answer looks like.

       outputpath/LC_NUMERIC
              One of the output files.  It describes the rules for formatting numbers in the locale.

       outputpath/LC_TIME
              One of the output files.  It describes the rules for formatting times and dates in the locale.

       outputpath/LC_PAPER
              One of the output files. It describes the default paper size in the locale.

       outputpath/LC_NAME
              One of the output files. It describes the rules for formatting names in the locale.

       outputpath/LC_ADDRESS
              One of the output files. It describes the rules for formatting addresses, and other location  informa‐
              tion in the locale.

       outputpath/LC_TELEPHONE
              One of the output files. It describes the rules for formatting telephone numbers in the locale.

       outputpath/LC_MEASUREMENT
              One  of  the  output files. It describes the rules for measurement in the locale, e.g. Metric or other
              units.

       outputpath/LC_IDENTIFICATION
              One of the output files. It identifies the elements within the locale.

EXAMPLES
       Compile the locale files for Finnish in the UTF-8 character set and add it to the default locale archive with
       the name fi_FI.UTF-8:

              localedef -f UTF-8 -i fi_FI fi_FI.UTF-8

       The  same,  but  generate  files  into the current directory (note that the last argument must then contain a
       slash):

              localedef -f UTF-8 -i fi_FI ./
