GFTYPE(1)                                      General Commands Manual                                     GFTYPE(1)



NAME
       gftype - translate a generic font file for humans to read

SYNOPSIS
       gftype [-i] [-m] gf_file_name [output_file_name]

DESCRIPTION
       This  manual  page  is not meant to be exhaustive.  The complete documentation for this version of TeX can be
       found in the info file or manual Web2C: A TeX implementation.

       The gftype program translates a gf (generic font) file output by, for example, mf(1), to a file  that  humans
       can  read.  It also serves as a gf file-validating program (i.e., if gftype can read it, it's correct) and as
       an example of a gf-reading program for other software that wants to read gf files.

       The gf_file_name on the command line must be complete. Because the resolution is part of  the  extension,  it
       would  not  make  sense to append a default extension as is done with TeX or DVI-reading software. If no out‐
       put_file_name is specified, the output goes to stdout.

OPTIONS
       The output file includes bitmap images of the characters, if -i is given on the command line, and a  symbolic
       listing of the gf commands, if -m is specified.

ENVIRONMENT
       gftype  looks for gf_file_name using the environment variable GFFONTS.  If that is not set, it uses the vari‐
       able TEXFONTS.  If that is not set, it uses the system default.

       David Fuchs and Don Knuth wrote the program.  It was published as part of the Metafontware technical  report,
       available from the TeX Users Group.  Paul Richards originally ported it to Unix.
