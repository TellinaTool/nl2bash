DESCRIPTION
       Hostname is used to display the system's DNS name, and to display or set its hostname or NIS domain name.


   GET NAME
       When called without any arguments, the program displays the current names:

       hostname will print the name of the system as returned by the gethostname(2) function.

       domainname will print the NIS domainname of the system.  domainname uses the gethostname(2)  function,  while
       ypdomainname and nisdomainname use the yp_get_default_domain(3).

       dnsdomainname  will print the domain part of the FQDN (Fully Qualified Domain Name). The complete FQDN of the
       system is returned with hostname --fqdn (but see the warnings in section THE FQDN below).


   SET NAME
       When called with one argument or with the --file option, the commands set the host name or the NIS/YP  domain
       name.   hostname uses the sethostname(2) function, while all of the three domainname, ypdomainname and nisdo‐
       mainname use setdomainname(2).  Note, that this is effective only until the next reboot.  Edit  /etc/hostname
       for permanent change.

       Note, that only the super-user can change the names.

       It  is  not  possible  to  set  the  FQDN or the DNS domain name with the dnsdomainname command (see THE FQDN
       below).

       The host name is usually set once at system startup in /etc/init.d/hostname.sh (normally by reading the  con‐
       tents of a file which contains the host name, e.g.  /etc/hostname).


   THE FQDN
       The  FQDN  (Fully  Qualified Domain Name) of the system is the name that the resolver(3) returns for the host
       name, such as, ursula.example.com.  It is usually the hostname followed by the  DNS  domain  name  (the  part
       after the first dot).  You can check the FQDN using hostname --fqdn or the domain name using dnsdomainname.

       You cannot change the FQDN with hostname or dnsdomainname.

       The  recommended  method of setting the FQDN is to make the hostname be an alias for the fully qualified name
       using /etc/hosts, DNS, or NIS. For example, if the hostname was "ursula", one might have a line in /etc/hosts
       which reads

              127.0.1.1    ursula.example.com ursula

       Technically:  The  FQDN is the name getaddrinfo(3) returns for the host name returned by gethostname(2).  The
       DNS domain name is the part after the first dot.

       Therefore it depends on the configuration of the resolver (usually in /etc/host.conf) how you can change  it.
       Usually the hosts file is parsed before DNS or NIS, so it is most common to change the FQDN in /etc/hosts.

       If a machine has multiple network interfaces/addresses or is used in a mobile environment, then it may either
       have multiple FQDNs/domain names or none at all. Therefore avoid using hostname --fqdn, hostname --domain and
       dnsdomainname.  hostname --ip-address is subject to the same limitations so it should be avoided as well.


OPTIONS
       -a, --alias
              Display  the  alias  name of the host (if used). This option is deprecated and should not be used any‐
              more.

       -A, --all-fqdns
              Displays all FQDNs of the machine. This option enumerates all configured network addresses on all con‐
              figured  network  interfaces, and translates them to DNS domain names. Addresses that cannot be trans‐
              lated (i.e. because they do not have an appropriate reverse IP entry) are skipped. Note that different
              addresses  may  resolve  to  the same name, therefore the output may contain duplicate entries. Do not
              make any assumptions about the order of the output.

       -b, --boot
              Always set a hostname; this allows the file specified by -F to be non-existant or empty, in which case
              the default hostname localhost will be used if none is yet set.

       -d, --domain
              Display  the  name  of  the  DNS  domain.  Don't use the command domainname to get the DNS domain name
              because it will show the NIS domain name and not the DNS domain name. Use dnsdomainname  instead.  See
              the warnings in section THE FQDN above, and avoid using this option.

       -f, --fqdn, --long
              Display  the  FQDN  (Fully  Qualified  Domain  Name). A FQDN consists of a short host name and the DNS
              domain name. Unless you are using bind or NIS for host lookups you can change the  FQDN  and  the  DNS
              domain  name  (which is part of the FQDN) in the /etc/hosts file. See the warnings in section THE FQDN
              above und use hostname --all-fqdns instead wherever possible.

       -F, --file filename
              Read the host name from the specified file. Comments (lines starting with a `#') are ignored.

       -i, --ip-address
              Display the network address(es) of the host name. Note that this works only if the host  name  can  be
              resolved. Avoid using this option; use hostname --all-ip-addresses instead.

       -I, --all-ip-addresses
              Display all network addresses of the host. This option enumerates all configured addresses on all net‐
              work interfaces. The loopback interface and IPv6 link-local addresses are omitted. Contrary to  option
              -i, this option does not depend on name resolution. Do not make any assumptions about the order of the
              output.

       -s, --short
              Display the short host name. This is the host name cut at the first dot.

       -V, --version
              Print version information on standard output and exit successfully.

       -y, --yp, --nis
              Display the NIS domain name. If a parameter is given (or --file name ) then root can also  set  a  new
              NIS domain.

       -h, --help
              Print a usage message and exit.

NOTES
       The  address  families hostname tries when looking up the FQDN, aliases and network addresses of the host are
       determined by the configuration of your resolver.  For instance, on GNU Libc systems,  the  resolver  can  be
       instructed to try IPv6 lookups first by using the inet6 option in /etc/resolv.conf.

FILES
       /etc/hostname  Historically  this  file  was supposed to only contain the hostname and not the full canonical
       FQDN. Nowadays most software is able to cope with a full FQDN here. This file is read at  boot  time  by  the
       system initialization scripts to set the hostname.

       /etc/hosts Usually, this is where one sets the domain name by aliasing the host name to the FQDN.
