NAME
       dh_installudev - install udev rules files

SYNOPSIS
       dh_installudev [debhelper options] [-n] [--name=name] [--priority=priority]

DESCRIPTION
       dh_installudev is a debhelper program that is responsible for installing udev rules files.

       Code is added to the preinst and postinst to handle the upgrade from the old udev rules file location.

FILES
       debian/package.udev
           Installed into lib/udev/rules.d/ in the package build directory.

OPTIONS
       --name=name
           When this parameter is used, dh_installudev looks for and installs files named debian/package.name.udev
           instead of the usual debian/package.udev.

       --priority=priority
           Sets the priority the file. Default is 40.

       -n, --noscripts
           Do not modify preinst/postinst scripts.

NOTES
       Note that this command is not idempotent. dh_prep(1) should be called between invocations of this command.
       Otherwise, it may cause multiple instances of the same text to be added to maintainer scripts.
