NAME
       pip - A tool for installing and managing Python packages

SYNOPSIS
       pip <command> [options]

       pip3 <command> [options]

DESCRIPTION
       pip  is a Python package installer, recommended for installing Python packages which are not available in the
       Debian archive.  It can work with version control repositories (currently only  Git,  Mercurial,  and  Bazaar
       repositories),  logs output extensively, and prevents partial installs by downloading all requirements before
       starting installation.

       On Debian, pip is the command to use when installing packages for Python 2, while pip3 is the command to  use
       when installing packages for Python 3.

COMMANDS
       The command comes before any options.  The following commands are recognized:

       help   Show help for commands.

       install
              Install packages.

       uninstall
              Uninstall packages.

       freeze Output installed packages in requirements format.

       list   List installed packages.

       show   Show information about installed packages.

       search Search PyPI for packages.

       wheel  Build wheels from your requirements.

GENERAL OPTIONS
       This  list  is  by no means complete, and it only describes options available to all commands.  Use pip <com‐
       mand> --help for more details on command specific options.  A few command options are provided below.

       -h, --help
              Show more detailed command help.

       -q, --quiet
              Give less output.

       --log-file <path>

              ~/.pip/pip.log.

       --log <path>
              Path to a verbose appending log.  This log is inactive by default.

       --cert <path>
              Path to alternate CA bundle.

INSTALL OPTIONS
       pip install installs packages from:

          · PyPI (a.k.a. The Cheeseshop) and other indexes, using requirements specifiers.

          · VCS project urls.

          · Local project directories.

          · Local or remote source archives

       -e,--editable <path/url>
              Install  a  project  in editable mode (i.e.  setuptools "develop mode") from a local project path or a
              VCS url.

       -r,--requirement <file>
              Install from the given requirements file.  This option can be used multiple times.

       -b,--build <dir>
              Directory to unpack packages into and build in.  The default in a virtualenv is  "<venv  path>/build".
              The default for global installs is "<OS temp dir>/pip_build_<username>".

       -t,--target <dir>
              Install packages into <dir>.

       -d,--download <dir>
              Download packages into <dir> instead of installing them, regardless of what's already installed.

       --download-cache <dir>
              Cache downloaded packages in <dir>.

       --src <dir>
              Directory to check out editable projects into.  The default in a virtualenv is "<venv path>/src".  The
              default for global installs is "<current dir>/src".

       -U, --upgrade
              Upgrade all packages to the newest available version.  This process is recursive regardless of whether
              a dependency is already satisfied.

       --force-reinstall
              When upgrading, reinstall all packages even if they are already up-to-date.

       -I, --ignore-installed
              Ignore the installed packages (reinstalling instead).

       --no-deps
              Don't install package dependencies.

       --install-option <options>
              Extra   arguments  to  be  supplied  to  the  setup.py  install  command  (use  like  --install-option
              ="--install-scripts=/usr/local/bin"). Use multiple --install-option options to pass  multiple  options
              to setup.py install. If you are using an option with a directory path, be sure to use absolute path.

       --global-option <options>
              Extra global options to be supplied to the setup.py call before the install command.

       --user Install using the user scheme.

       --egg  Install packages as eggs, not 'flat', like pip normally does. This option is not about installing from
              eggs. (WARNING: Because this option overrides pip's normal install logic, requirements files  may  not
              behave as expected.)

       --root <dir>
              Install everything relative to this alternate root directory.

       --compile
              Compile py files to pyc.

       --no-compile
              Do not compile py files to pyc.

       --no-use-wheel
              Do not find and prefer wheel archives when searching indexes and find-links locations.

       --pre  Include pre-release and development versions. By default, pip only finds stable versions.

       --no-clean
              Don't clean up build directories.

       Package Index Options:

       -i,--index-url <url>
              Base URL of Python Package Index (default https://pypi.python.org/simple/).

       --extra-index-url <url>
              Extra URLs of package indexes to use in addition to --index-url.

       --no-index
              Ignore package index (only looking at --find-links URLs instead).

       -f,--find-links <url>
              If  a  url  or  path to an html file, then parse for links to archives. If a local path or file:// url
              that's a directory, then look for archives in the directory listing.

       --allow-external <package>
              Allow the installation of externally hosted files

       --allow-all-external
              Allow the installation of all externally hosted files

       --allow-unverified <package>
              Allow the installation of insecure and unverifiable files

       --process-dependency-links
              Enable the processing of dependency links.

UNINSTALL OPTIONS
       pip is able to uninstall most installed packages. Known exceptions are:

          · Pure distutils packages installed with python setup.py install, which leave behind no metadata to deter‐
            mine what files were installed.

          · Script wrappers installed by python setup.py develop.

       -r,--requirement <file>
              Uninstall  all  the  packages listed in the given requirements file.  This option can be used multiple
              times.

       -y, --yes
              Don't ask for confirmation of uninstall deletions.
