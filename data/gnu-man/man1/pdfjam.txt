NAME
       pdfjam - A shell script for manipulating PDF files

SYNOPSIS
       pdfjam [OPTION [OPTION] ...] [SRC [PAGESPEC] [SRC [PAGESPEC]] ...]

DESCRIPTION
       pdfjam provides a front end to most capabilities of the "pdfpages" package (by Andreas Matthias) of pdflatex.
       Detailed information can be found via "pdfjam --help", and also in the web page mentioned below .

       A working installation of pdflatex, with the pdfpages package, is required.

       The pdfjam script is distributed as (the main) part of the PDFjam package.  The  homepage  of  PDFjam  is  at
       http://go.warwick.ac.uk/pdfjam .

SETUP
       See http://go.warwick.ac.uk/pdfjam .

       For further information and some examples see http://go.warwick.ac.uk/pdfjam .

CONFIGURATION FILES
       Configuration of the PDFjam utilities involves specifying the location of pdflatex, the location of temporary
       files, specification of default page size, etc.  This is done in a block of lines near the top of the  pdfjam
       script;  settings  made  there  are  over-ridden  by any that are found at a site-wide configuration file (at
       /etc/pdfjam.conf, /usr/share/etc/pdfjam.conf, /usr/local/share/pdfjam.conf,  or  /usr/local/etc/pdfjam.conf),
       which in turn are over-ridden by any that are found in a user-defaults file at ~/.pdfjam.conf.

LIMITATIONS AND BUGS
       pdfjam does not work with encrypted PDF files, and does not preserve hyperlinks.

       Please report bugs! See the website at http://go.warwick.ac.uk/pdfjam .
