NAME
       dpkg-buildpackage - build binary or source packages from sources

SYNOPSIS
       dpkg-buildpackage [option...]

DESCRIPTION
       dpkg-buildpackage  is  a  program that automates the process of building a Debian package. It consists of the
       following steps:

       1. It prepares the build environment by setting various environment variables  (see  ENVIRONMENT)  and  calls
          dpkg-source --before-build (unless -T or --target has been used).

       2. It checks that the build-dependencies and build-conflicts are satisfied (unless -d is specified).

       3. If  a  specific  target  has  been selected with the -T or --target option, it calls that target and stops
          here. Otherwise it calls fakeroot debian/rules clean to clean the build-tree (unless -nc is specified).

       4. It calls dpkg-source -b to generate the source package (unless a binary-only build has been requested with
          -b, -B or -A).

       5. It  calls  debian/rules build-target followed by fakeroot debian/rules binary-target (unless a source-only
          build has been requested with -S). Note that build-target and binary-target are either  build  and  binary
          (default  case, or if -b is specified), or build-arch and binary-arch (if -B is specified), or build-indep
          and binary-indep (if -A is specified).

       6. It calls gpg2 or gpg to sign the .dsc file (if any, unless -us is specified or on UNRELEASED builds).

       7. It calls dpkg-genchanges to generate a .changes file.  Many dpkg-buildpackage  options  are  forwarded  to
          dpkg-genchanges.

       8. It calls gpg2 or gpg to sign the .changes file (unless -uc is specified or on UNRELEASED builds).

       9. If  -tc  is  specified,  it  will  call  fakeroot  debian/rules  clean again. Finally it calls dpkg-source
          --after-build.

OPTIONS
       -b     Specifies a binary-only build, no source files are to be built and/or distributed. Passed to dpkg-gen‐
              changes.

       -B     Specifies a binary-only build, limited to architecture dependent packages.  Passed to dpkg-genchanges.

       -A     Specifies  a  binary-only  build,  limited  to  architecture independent packages. Passed to dpkg-gen‐
              changes.

       -S     Specifies a source-only build, no binary packages need to be made.  Passed to dpkg-genchanges.

       -F     Specifies a normal full build, binary and source packages will be built.  This  is  the  same  as  the
              default case when no build option is specified.

       --target=target
       --target target
       -Ttarget
              Calls debian/rules target after having setup the build environment and stops the package build process
              here. If --as-root is also given, then the command is executed as root (see -r).  Note  that  official
              targets that are required to be run as root by the Debian policy do not need this option.

       --as-root
              Only meaningful together with --target. Requires that the target be run with root rights.

       -si
       -sa
       -sd
       -vversion
       -Cchanges-description
       -mmaintainer-address
       -emaintainer-address
              Passed unchanged to dpkg-genchanges. See its manual page.

       -aarchitecture
              Specify  the  Debian  architecture we build for. The architecture of the machine we build on is deter‐
              mined automatically, and is also the default for the host machine.

       -tgnu-system-type
              Specify the GNU system type we build for. It can be used in place of -a or as a complement to override
              the default GNU system type of the target Debian architecture.

       -Pprofile[,...]
              Specify  the  profile(s) we build, as a comma-separated list, without the "profile." namespace prefix.
              The default behavior is to build for no specific profile. Also adds them (as a space  separated  list)
              to  the  DEB_BUILD_PROFILES  environment variable which allows, for example, debian/rules files to use
              this information for conditional builds.

       -jjobs Number of jobs allowed to be run simultaneously, equivalent to the make(1) option of  the  same  name.
              Will  add itself to the MAKEFLAGS environment variable, which should cause all subsequent make invoca‐
              tions to inherit the option. Also adds parallel=jobs to  the  DEB_BUILD_OPTIONS  environment  variable
              which  allows debian/rules files to use this information for their own purposes.  The parallel=jobs in
              DEB_BUILD_OPTIONS environment variable will override the -j value if this option is given.

       -D     Check build dependencies and conflicts; abort if unsatisfied. This is the default behavior.

       -d     Do not check build dependencies and conflicts.

       -nc    Do not clean the source tree (implies -b if nothing else has been selected among -B, -A or -S).

       -tc    Clean the source tree (using gain-root-command debian/rules clean) after the package has been built.

       -rgain-root-command
              When dpkg-buildpackage needs to execute part of the build process as root, it prefixes the command  it
              executes  with  gain-root-command  if  one  has been specified. Otherwise, if none has been specified,
              fakeroot will be used by default, if the command is present.  gain-root-command should start with  the
              name  of  a  program on the PATH and will get as arguments the name of the real command to run and the
              arguments it should take.  gain-root-command can include parameters (they must be space-separated) but
              no shell metacharacters.  gain-root-command might typically be fakeroot, sudo, super or really.  su is
              not suitable, since it can only invoke the user's shell with -c instead of passing arguments individu‐
              ally to the command to be run.

       -Rrules-file
              Building  a  Debian  package usually involves invoking debian/rules as a command with several standard
              parameters. With this option it's possible to use another program invocation to build the package  (it
              can  include  space separated parameters).  Alternatively it can be used to execute the standard rules
              file with another make program (for example by using /usr/local/bin/make  -f  debian/rules  as  rules-
              file).

       -psign-command
              When dpkg-buildpackage needs to execute GPG to sign a source control (.dsc) file or a .changes file it
              will run sign-command (searching the PATH if necessary) instead of gpg2 or gpg. sign-command will  get
              all  the  arguments  that gpg2 or gpg would have gotten. sign-command should not contain spaces or any
              other shell metacharacters.

       -kkey-id
              Specify a key-ID to use when signing packages.

       -us    Do not sign the source package.

       -uc    Do not sign the .changes file.

       --force-sign
              Force the signing of the resulting files (since dpkg 1.17.0), regardless of -us or -uc or other inter‐
              nal heuristics.

       -i[regex]
       -I[pattern]
       -s[nsAkurKUR]
       -z, -Z Passed unchanged to dpkg-source. See its manual page.

       --source-option=opt
              Pass option opt to dpkg-source.

       --changes-option=opt
              Pass option opt to dpkg-genchanges.

       --admindir=dir
       --admindir dir
              Change the location of the dpkg database. The default location is /var/lib/dpkg.

       -?, --help
              Show the usage message and exit.

       --version
              Show the version and exit.

ENVIRONMENT
       DEB_SIGN_KEYID
              If set, it will be used to sign the .changes and .dsc files.  Overridden by the -k option.

       DEB_BUILD_PROFILES
              If set, it will be used as the active build profile(s) for the package being built. It is a space sep‐
              arated list of profile names, without the "profile." namespace prefix. Overridden by the -P option.


   Reliance on exported environment flags
       Even if dpkg-buildpackage exports some variables, debian/rules should not rely on their presence  and  should
       instead use the respective interface to retrieve the needed values.

   Variables set by dpkg-architecture
       dpkg-architecture  is  called  with the -a and -t parameters forwarded. Any variable that is output by its -s
       option is integrated in the build environment.

NOTES
   Compiler flags are no longer exported
       Between dpkg 1.14.17 and  1.16.1,  dpkg-buildpackage  exported  compiler  flags  (CFLAGS,  CXXFLAGS,  FFLAGS,
       CPPFLAGS and LDFLAGS) with values as returned by dpkg-buildflags. This is no longer the case.

   Default build targets
       dpkg-buildpackage  is  using the build-arch and build-indep targets since dpkg 1.16.2. Those targets are thus
       mandatory. But to avoid breakages of existing packages, and ease the transition, it will  fallback  to  using
       the build target if make -f debian/rules -qn build-target returns 2 as exit code.

BUGS
       It  should be possible to specify spaces and shell metacharacters in and initial arguments for gain-root-com‐
       mand and sign-command.
