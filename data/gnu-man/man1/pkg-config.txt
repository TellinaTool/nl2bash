DESCRIPTION
       The  pkg-config program is used to retrieve information about installed libraries in the system.  It is typi‐
       cally used to compile and link against one or more libraries.  Here is a typical usage scenario  in  a  Make‐
       file:

       program: program.c
            cc program.c $(pkg-config --cflags --libs gnomeui)

       pkg-config  retrieves information about packages from special metadata files. These files are named after the
       package, and has a .pc extension.  On most systems, pkg-config looks in  /usr/lib/pkgconfig,  /usr/share/pkg‐
       config,  /usr/local/lib/pkgconfig  and /usr/local/share/pkgconfig for these files.  It will additionally look
       in the colon-separated (on Windows, semicolon-separated) list of directories specified by the PKG_CONFIG_PATH
       environment variable.

       The  package  name  specified  on the pkg-config command line is defined to be the name of the metadata file,
       minus the .pc extension. If a library can install multiple versions simultaneously, it must give each version
       its own name (for example, GTK 1.2 might have the package name "gtk+" while GTK 2.0 has "gtk+-2.0").

       In  addition to specifying a package name on the command line, the full path to a given .pc file may be given
       instead. This allows a user to directly query a particular .pc file.

OPTIONS
       The following options are supported:

       --modversion
              Requests that the version information of the libraries specified on the command line be displayed.  If
              pkg-config can find all the libraries on the command line, each library's version string is printed to
              stdout, one version per line. In this case pkg-config exits successfully. If one or more libraries  is
              unknown, pkg-config exits with a nonzero code, and the contents of stdout are undefined.

       --help Displays a help message and terminates.

       --print-errors
              If  one  or  more  of  the modules on the command line, or their dependencies, are not found, or if an
              error occurs in parsing a .pc file, then this option will cause errors explaining the  problem  to  be
              printed. With "predicate" options such as "--exists" pkg-config runs silently by default, because it's
              usually used in scripts that want to control what's output. This option can be  used  alone  (to  just
              print  errors  encountered  locating  modules on the command line) or with other options. The PKG_CON‐
              FIG_DEBUG_SPEW environment variable overrides this option.

       --silence-errors
              If one or more of the modules on the command line, or their dependencies, are  not  found,  or  if  an
              error  occurs  in  parsing a a .pc file, then this option will keep errors explaining the problem from
              being printed. With "predicate" options such  as  "--exists"  pkg-config  runs  silently  by  default,
              because it's usually used in scripts that want to control what's output. So this option is only useful
              with options such as  "--cflags"  or  "--modversion"  that  print  errors  by  default.  The  PKG_CON‐
              FIG_DEBUG_SPEW environment variable overrides this option.

       --errors-to-stdout
              If printing errors, print them to stdout rather than the default stderr


       The following options are used to compile and link programs:

       --cflags
              This  prints  pre-processor  and  compile  flags required to compile the packages on the command line,
              including flags for all their dependencies. Flags are "compressed" so that each identical flag appears
              only once. pkg-config exits with a nonzero code if it can't find metadata for one or more of the pack‐
              ages on the command line.

       --cflags-only-I
              This prints the -I part of "--cflags". That is, it defines the header search path but doesn't  specify
              anything else.

       --libs This  option  is identical to "--cflags", only it prints the link flags. As with "--cflags", duplicate
              flags are merged (maintaining proper ordering), and flags for dependencies are included in the output.

       --libs-only-L
              This prints the -L/-R part of "--libs". That is, it defines the library search path but doesn't  spec‐
              ify which libraries to link with.

       --libs-only-l
              This  prints  the  -l  part of "--libs" for the libraries specified on the command line. Note that the
              union of "--libs-only-l" and "--libs-only-L" may be smaller than "--libs", due to flags such as  -rdy‐
              namic.

       --variable=VARIABLENAME
              This  returns  the value of a variable defined in a package's .pc file. Most packages define the vari‐
              able "prefix", for example, so you can say:
                $ pkg-config --variable=prefix glib-2.0
                /usr/

       --define-variable=VARIABLENAME=VARIABLEVALUE
              This sets a global value for a variable, overriding the value in any .pc files. Most  packages  define
              the variable "prefix", for example, so you can say:
                $ pkg-config --print-errors --define-variable=prefix=/foo \
                             --variable=prefix glib-2.0
                /foo

       --print-variables
              Returns a list of all variables defined in the package.


       --uninstalled
              Normally  if  you  request the package "foo" and the package "foo-uninstalled" exists, pkg-config will
              prefer the "-uninstalled" variant. This allows compilation/linking against  uninstalled  packages.  If
              you  specify  the  "--uninstalled"  option,  pkg-config will return successfully if any "-uninstalled"
              packages are being used, and return failure (false)  otherwise.   (The  PKG_CONFIG_DISABLE_UNINSTALLED
              environment  variable  keeps  pkg-config  from implicitly choosing "-uninstalled" packages, so if that
              variable is set, they will only have been used if you pass a name like "foo-uninstalled" on  the  com‐
              mand line explicitly.)

       --exists

       --atleast-version=VERSION

       --exact-version=VERSION

       --max-version=VERSION
              These  options  test whether the package or list of packages on the command line are known to pkg-con‐
              fig, and optionally whether the version number of a package meets certain constraints.  If  all  pack‐
              ages  exist  and  meet  the specified version constraints, pkg-config exits successfully. Otherwise it
              exits unsuccessfully.

              Rather than using the version-test options, you can simply give a version constraint after each  pack‐
              age name, for example:
                $ pkg-config --exists 'glib-2.0 >= 1.3.4 libxml = 1.8.3'
              Remember to use --print-errors if you want error messages.

       --msvc-syntax
              This  option  is available only on Windows. It causes pkg-config to output -l and -L flags in the form
              recognized  by  the  Microsoft  Visual  C++  command-line  compiler,  cl.  Specifically,  instead   of
              -Lx:/some/path  it  prints /libpath:x/some/path, and instead of -lfoo it prints foo.lib. Note that the
              --libs output consists of flags for the linker, and should be placed on the cl command  line  after  a
              /link switch.

       --dont-define-prefix
              This option is available only on Windows. It prevents pkg-config from automatically trying to override
              the value of the variable "prefix" in each .pc file.

       --prefix-variable=PREFIX
              Also this option is available only on Windows. It sets the name of the variable that pkg-config  auto‐
              matically sets as described above.

       --static
              Output  libraries suitable for static linking.  That means including any private libraries in the out‐
              put.  This relies on proper tagging in the .pc files, else a too large number of libraries will  ordi‐
              narily be output.

       --list-all
              List all modules found in the pkg-config path.

       -I "--print-provides"
              List all modules the given packages provides.

       --print-requires
              List all modules the given packages requires.

       --print-requires-private
              List all modules the given packages requires for static linking (see --static).

ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES
       PKG_CONFIG_PATH
              A  colon-separated (on Windows, semicolon-separated) list of directories to search for .pc files.  The
              default  directory  will  always  be   searched   after   searching   the   path;   the   default   is
              libdir/pkgconfig:datadir/pkgconfig  where  libdir  is  the  libdir  for  pkg-config and datadir is the
              datadir for pkg-config when it was installed.

       PKG_CONFIG_DEBUG_SPEW
              If set, causes pkg-config to print all kinds of debugging information and report all errors.

       PKG_CONFIG_TOP_BUILD_DIR
              A value to set for the magic variable pc_top_builddir which may appear in .pc files. If  the  environ‐
              ment variable is not set, the default value '$(top_builddir)' will be used. This variable should refer
              to the top builddir of the Makefile where the compile/link flags reported by pkg-config will be  used.
              This only matters when compiling/linking against a package that hasn't yet been installed.

       PKG_CONFIG_DISABLE_UNINSTALLED
              Normally  if  you  request the package "foo" and the package "foo-uninstalled" exists, pkg-config will
              prefer the "-uninstalled" variant. This allows compilation/linking against uninstalled  packages.   If
              this environment variable is set, it disables said behavior.

       PKG_CONFIG_ALLOW_SYSTEM_CFLAGS
              Don't strip -I/usr/include out of cflags.

       PKG_CONFIG_ALLOW_SYSTEM_LIBS
              Don't strip -L/usr/lib out of libs

       PKG_CONFIG_SYSROOT_DIR
              Modify  -I and -L to use the directories located in target sysroot.  this option is useful when cross-
              compiling packages that use pkg-config to determine CFLAGS and LDFLAGS. -I  and  -L  are  modified  to
              point  to  the  new  system  root.  this  means  that  a -I/usr/include/libfoo will become -I/var/tar‐
              get/usr/include/libfoo with a PKG_CONFIG_SYSROOT_DIR equal to /var/target (same rule apply to -L)

       PKG_CONFIG_LIBDIR
              Replaces the default pkg-config search directory, usually /usr/lib/pkgconfig

QUERYING PKG-CONFIG'S DEFAULTS
       pkg-config can be used to query itself for the default search path, version number and other information, for
       instance using:
         $ pkg-config --variable pc_path pkg-config
       or
         $ pkg-config --modversion pkg-config

WINDOWS SPECIALITIES
       If  a  .pc file is found in a directory that matches the usual conventions (i.e., ends with \lib\pkgconfig or
       \share\pkgconfig), the prefix for that package is assumed to be the grandparent of the  directory  where  the
       file was found, and the prefix variable is overridden for that file accordingly.

       If  the value of a variable in a .pc file begins with the original, non-overridden, value of the prefix vari‐
       able, then the overridden value of prefix is used instead.

AUTOCONF MACROS
       PKG_CHECK_MODULES(VARIABLE-PREFIX, MODULES [,ACTION-IF-FOUND [,ACTION-IF-NOT-FOUND]])

              The macro PKG_CHECK_MODULES can be used in configure.ac to check  whether  modules  exist.  A  typical
              usage would be:
               PKG_CHECK_MODULES([MYSTUFF], [gtk+-2.0 >= 1.3.5 libxml = 1.8.4])

              This  would  result  in  MYSTUFF_LIBS  and  MYSTUFF_CFLAGS substitution variables, set to the libs and
              cflags for the given module list.  If a module is missing or has the wrong version, by default config‐
              ure  will  abort  with  a  message.  To  replace  the  default action, specify an ACTION-IF-NOT-FOUND.
              PKG_CHECK_MODULES will not print any error messages if you specify your own ACTION-IF-NOT-FOUND.  How‐
              ever, it will set the variable MYSTUFF_PKG_ERRORS, which you can use to display what went wrong.

              Note  that  if there is a possibility the first call to PKG_CHECK_MODULES might not happen, you should
              be sure to include an explicit call to PKG_PROG_PKG_CONFIG in your configure.ac.

       PKG_PROG_PKG_CONFIG([MIN-VERSION])

              Defines the PKG_CONFIG variable to the best pkg-config available, useful if you  need  pkg-config  but
              don't want to use PKG_CHECK_MODULES.

       PKG_CHECK_EXISTS(MODULES, [ACTION-IF-FOUND], [ACTION-IF-NOT-FOUND])

              Check to see whether a particular set of modules exists.  Similar to PKG_CHECK_MODULES(), but does not
              set variables or print errors.

              Similar to PKG_CHECK_MODULES, make sure that the  first  instance  of  this  or  PKG_CHECK_MODULES  is
              called, or make sure to call PKG_CHECK_EXISTS manually.


METADATA FILE SYNTAX
       To add a library to the set of packages pkg-config knows about, simply install a .pc file. You should install
       this file to libdir/pkgconfig.

       Here is an example file:
       # This is a comment
       prefix=/home/hp/unst   # this defines a variable
       exec_prefix=${prefix}  # defining another variable in terms of the first
       libdir=${exec_prefix}/lib
       includedir=${prefix}/include

       Name: GObject                            # human-readable name
       Description: Object/type system for GLib # human-readable description
       Version: 1.3.1
       URL: http://www.gtk.org
       Requires: glib-2.0 = 1.3.1
       Conflicts: foobar <= 4.5
       Libs: -L${libdir} -lgobject-1.3
       Libs.private: -lm
       Cflags: -I${includedir}/glib-2.0 -I${libdir}/glib/include

       You would normally generate the file using configure, so that the prefix, etc. are set to the proper  values.
       The  GNU Autoconf manual recommends generating files like .pc files at build time rather than configure time,
       so when you build the .pc file is a matter of taste and preference.

       Files have two kinds of line: keyword lines start with a keyword plus a colon, and variable definitions start
       with  an alphanumeric string plus an equals sign. Keywords are defined in advance and have special meaning to
       pkg-config; variables do not, you can have any variables that you wish (however, users may expect to retrieve
       the usual directory name variables).

       Note that variable references are written "${foo}"; you can escape literal "${" as "$${".

       Name:  This  field should be a human-readable name for the package. Note that it is not the name passed as an
              argument to pkg-config.

       Description:
              This should be a brief description of the package

       URL:   An URL where people can get more information about and download the package

       Version:
              This should be the most-specific-possible package version string.

       Requires:
              This is a comma-separated list of packages that are required by your  package.  Flags  from  dependent
              packages  will  be  merged  in to the flags reported for your package. Optionally, you can specify the
              version of the required package (using the operators =, <, >, >=, <=);  specifying  a  version  allows
              pkg-config  to  perform  extra  sanity  checks.  You may only mention the same package one time on the
              Requires: line. If the version of a package is unspecified, any version will be used with no checking.

       Requires.private:
              A list of packages required by this package. The difference from Requires is that the packages  listed
              under  Requires.private are not taken into account when a flag list is computed for dynamically linked
              executable (i.e., when --static was not specified).  In the situation where each .pc file  corresponds
              to  a  library,  Requires.private  shall  be  used exclusively to specify the dependencies between the
              libraries.

       Conflicts:
              This optional line allows pkg-config to perform additional sanity checks, primarily to  detect  broken
              user  installations.   The  syntax  is the same as Requires: except that you can list the same package
              more than once here, for example "foobar = 1.2.3, foobar = 1.2.5, foobar >= 1.3", if you  have  reason
              to do so. If a version isn't specified, then your package conflicts with all versions of the mentioned
              package.  If a user tries to use your package and a conflicting package at the same  time,  then  pkg-
              config will complain.

       Libs:  This line should give the link flags specific to your package.  Don't add any flags for required pack‐
              ages; pkg-config will add those automatically.

       Libs.private:
              This line should list any private libraries in use.  Private libraries are  libraries  which  are  not
              exposed  through  your  library,  but  are  needed  in  the  case of static linking. This differs from
              Requires.private in that it references libraries that do not have package files installed.

       Cflags:
              This line should list the compile flags specific to your package.  Don't add any  flags  for  required
              packages; pkg-config will add those automatically.

AUTHOR
       pkg-config was written by James Henstridge, rewritten by Martijn van Beers, and rewritten again by Havoc Pen‐
       nington. Tim Janik, Owen Taylor, and Raja Harinath submitted suggestions and  some  code.   gnome-config  was
       written  by  Miguel  de  Icaza, Raja Harinath and various hackers in the GNOME team.  It was inspired by Owen
       Taylor's gtk-config program.

BUGS
       pkg-config does not handle mixing of parameters with and without = well.  Stick with one.
