RUNCON(1)                                           User Commands                                          RUNCON(1)



NAME
       runcon - run command with specified security context

SYNOPSIS
       runcon CONTEXT COMMAND [args]
       runcon [ -c ] [-u USER] [-r ROLE] [-t TYPE] [-l RANGE] COMMAND [args]

DESCRIPTION
       Run  COMMAND  with completely-specified CONTEXT, or with current or transitioned security context modified by
       one or more of LEVEL, ROLE, TYPE, and USER.

       If none of -c, -t, -u, -r, or -l, is specified, the first argument is used  as  the  complete  context.   Any
       additional arguments after COMMAND are interpreted as arguments to the command.

       Note that only carefully-chosen contexts are likely to successfully run.

       Run  a program in a different security context.  With neither CONTEXT nor COMMAND, print the current security
       context.

       Mandatory arguments to long options are mandatory for short options too.

              Complete security context

       -c, --compute
              compute process transition context before modifying
