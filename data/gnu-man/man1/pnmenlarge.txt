NAME
       pnmenlarge - read a portable anymap and enlarge it N times

SYNOPSIS
       pnmenlarge N [pnmfile]

DESCRIPTION
       Reads a portable anymap as input.  Replicates its pixels N times, and produces a portable anymap as output.

       pnmenlarge  can  only enlarge by integer factors.  The slower but more general pnmscale can enlarge or reduce
       by arbitrary factors, and pbmreduce can reduce by integer factors, but only for bitmaps.

       If you enlarge by a factor of 3 or more, you should probably add a pnmsmooth step; otherwise, you can see the
       original pixels in the resulting image.
