PG_XLOGDUMP(1)                             PostgreSQL 9.3.16 Documentation                            PG_XLOGDUMP(1)



NAME
       pg_xlogdump - display a human-readable rendering of the write-ahead log of a PostgreSQL database cluster

SYNOPSIS
       pg_xlogdump [option...] [startseg [endseg]]

DESCRIPTION
       pg_xlogdump displays the write-ahead log (WAL) and is mainly useful for debugging or educational purposes.

       This utility can only be run by the user who installed the server, because it requires read-only access to
       the data directory.

OPTIONS
       The following command-line options control the location and format of the output:

       startseg
           Start reading at the specified log segment file. This implicitly determines the path in which files will
           be searched for, and the timeline to use.

       endseg
           Stop after reading the specified log segment file.

       -b, --bkp-details
           Output detailed information about backup blocks.

       -e end, --end=end
           Stop reading at the specified log position, instead of reading to the end of the log stream.

       -n limit, --limit=limit
           Display the specified number of records, then stop.

       -p path, --path=path
           Directory in which to find log segment files. The default is to search for them in the pg_xlog
           subdirectory of the current directory.

       -r rmgr, --rmgr=rmgr
           Only display records generated by the specified resource manager. If list is passed as name, print a list
           of valid resource manager names, and exit.

       -s start, --start=start
           Log position at which to start reading. The default is to start reading the first valid log record found
           in the earliest file found.

       -t timeline, --timeline=timeline
           Timeline from which to read log records. The default is to use the value in startseg, if that is
           specified; otherwise, the default is 1.

       -V, --version
           Print the pg_xlogdump version and exit.

       -x xid, --xid=xid
           Only display records marked with the given TransactionId.

       -?, --help
           Show help about pg_xlogdump command line arguments, and exit.

NOTES
       Can give wrong results when the server is running.

       Only the specified timeline is displayed (or the default, if none is specified). Records in other timelines
       are ignored.
