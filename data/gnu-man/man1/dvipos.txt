NAME
       dvipos - compute positions in a DVI file


SYNOPSIS
       dvipos [ OPTION... ] infile[.dvi]


DESCRIPTION
       dvipos  parses  a  DVI file looking for pos: specials.  It currently recognizes pos:pxy, pos:pxywhd, pos:pxy‐
       plus, pos:begbox, pos:endbox, pos:beglines, and pos:endlines.  It then outputs  the  information  from  those
       specials  along  with  information that only a DVI postprocessor could determine, such as the current x and y
       location.  The output looks like:
          \pospxywhd{text:54}{54}{10663sp}{8535sp}{21326sp}{34081sp}{0sp}
       and is suitable for including in a tex(1) or pdftex(1) auxilliary file, such as document.tuo, to be  read  in
       by the next run of the tex(1) or similar typesetting engine.


OPTIONS
       -h, --help
              print usage.

       -W, --warning
              print warnings.

       -v, --verbose
              print verbose output.

       -d, --debug
              print dvitype(1) debugging data.

       -s, --smashchars
              regard height and depth as zero.

       -o, --output=FILE
              send all output to FILE.  Without this option, output goes to stdout.

       -b, --bbox[=FILE]
              send bounding box to FILE (default FILE is infile.pos).

       -f, --framed[=BASE]
              request  copy  of  DVI file, BASE.dvi, with bounding boxes framed (default FILE is infile_frames.dvi).
              See the --framesize option.

       -m, --mag=INT
              override tex(1) magnification by INT.

       -w, --framesize=INT
              set frame rule size by INT (default 6554 = .1pt).

       -p, --pages=X:Y
              set page ranges from X to Y.


USAGE
       dvipos is run mostly behind the scenes by ConTeXt's texexec(1) between runs of tex(1) or pdftex(1), in  order
       to  provide information to and get information about positional graphics.  These graphics are provided by the
       MetaFun interface to mpost(1).  dvipos is not used (or needed) in PDF-output mode but is needed for  DVI-out‐
       put  mode.   pdftex(1)  starting with version 1.40 can produce position information even in DVI mode, so once
       the ConTeXt macros take advantage of this feature, the need for dvipos will fade.

       Until then, here is a typical use of dvipos:
          dvipos notes.dvi
       The position information that is output is collected by texexec(1) to include  in  the  notes.tuo  auxilliary
       file to use in the next run.



EXAMPLES
       Extract positions from doc.dvi, with output to doc.loc:
              dvipos -o doc.loc doc.dvi

       Same as above, but also send bbox information to doc.pos:
              dvipos -b -o doc.loc doc.dvi

       Instead send bbox information to /tmp/debug.pos:
              dvipos -b=/tmp/debug.pos -o doc.loc doc.dvi


SEE ALSO
       dvips(1), dvitype(1), mpost(1), pdftex(1), tex(1), texexec(1).

       For more about positional graphics, see the MetaFun documentation on the ConTeXt wiki ⟨http://
       wiki.contextgarden.net/MetaFun⟩.


BUGS
       If you specify a file for the -b option, you must join the option and name with = rather than (the more  com‐
       mon) space:
          dvipos -b=/tmp/debug.pos notes.dvi
       works, but
          dvipos -b /tmp/debug.pos notes.dvi
       does not.
