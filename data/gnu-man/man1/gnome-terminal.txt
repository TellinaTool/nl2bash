DESCRIPTION
       GNOME Terminal is a terminal emulation application that you can use to perform the following actions:

       Access a UNIX shell in the GNOME environment.

       A shell is a program that interprets and executes the commands that you type at a command line  prompt.  When
       you  start GNOME Terminal, the application starts the default shell that is specified in your system account.
       You can switch to a different shell at any time.

       Run any application that is designed to run on VT102, VT220, and xterm terminals.

       GNOME Terminal emulates the xterm program developed by the X Consortium. In turn, the xterm program  emulates
       the  DEC  VT102  terminal and also supports the DEC VT220 escape sequences. An escape sequence is a series of
       characters that starts with the Esc character.

       GNOME Terminal accepts all of the escape sequences that the VT102 and VT220 terminals use for functions  such
       as positioning the cursor and clearing the screen.
