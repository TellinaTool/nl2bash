DH_LINK(1)                                            Debhelper                                           DH_LINK(1)



NAME
       dh_link - create symlinks in package build directories

SYNOPSIS
       dh_link [debhelper options] [-A] [-Xitem] [source destination ...]

DESCRIPTION
       dh_link is a debhelper program that creates symlinks in package build directories.

       dh_link accepts a list of pairs of source and destination files. The source files are the already existing
       files that will be symlinked from. The destination files are the symlinks that will be created. There must be
       an equal number of source and destination files specified.

       Be sure you do specify the full filename to both the source and destination files (unlike you would do if you
       were using something like ln(1)).

       dh_link will generate symlinks that comply with Debian policy - absolute when policy says they should be
       absolute, and relative links with as short a path as possible. It will also create any subdirectories it
       needs to to put the symlinks in.

       Any pre-existing destination files will be replaced with symlinks.

       dh_link also scans the package build tree for existing symlinks which do not conform to Debian policy, and
       corrects them (v4 or later).

FILES
       debian/package.links
           Lists pairs of source and destination files to be symlinked. Each pair should be put on its own line,
           with the source and destination separated by whitespace.

OPTIONS
       -A, --all
           Create any links specified by command line parameters in ALL packages acted on, not just the first.

       -Xitem, --exclude=item
           Exclude symlinks that contain item anywhere in their filename from being corrected to comply with Debian
           policy.

       source destination ...
           Create a file named destination as a link to a file named source. Do this in the package build directory
           of the first package acted on.  (Or in all packages if -A is specified.)

EXAMPLES
        dh_link usr/share/man/man1/foo.1 usr/share/man/man1/bar.1

       Make bar.1 be a symlink to foo.1

        dh_link var/lib/foo usr/lib/foo \
          usr/share/man/man1/foo.1 usr/share/man/man1/bar.1

       Make /usr/lib/foo/ be a link to /var/lib/foo/, and bar.1 be a symlink to the foo.1
