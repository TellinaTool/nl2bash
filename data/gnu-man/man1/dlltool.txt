DESCRIPTION
       dlltool reads its inputs, which can come from the -d and -b options as well as object files specified on the
       command line.  It then processes these inputs and if the -e option has been specified it creates a exports
       file.  If the -l option has been specified it creates a library file and if the -z option has been specified
       it creates a def file.  Any or all of the -e, -l and -z options can be present in one invocation of dlltool.

       When creating a DLL, along with the source for the DLL, it is necessary to have three other files.  dlltool
       can help with the creation of these files.

       The first file is a .def file which specifies which functions are exported from the DLL, which functions the
       DLL imports, and so on.  This is a text file and can be created by hand, or dlltool can be used to create it
       using the -z option.  In this case dlltool will scan the object files specified on its command line looking
       for those functions which have been specially marked as being exported and put entries for them in the .def
       file it creates.

       In order to mark a function as being exported from a DLL, it needs to have an -export:<name_of_function>
       entry in the .drectve section of the object file.  This can be done in C by using the asm() operator:

                 asm (".section .drectve");
                 asm (".ascii \"-export:my_func\"");

                 int my_func (void) { ... }

       The second file needed for DLL creation is an exports file.  This file is linked with the object files that
       make up the body of the DLL and it handles the interface between the DLL and the outside world.  This is a
       binary file and it can be created by giving the -e option to dlltool when it is creating or reading in a .def
       file.

       The third file needed for DLL creation is the library file that programs will link with in order to access
       the functions in the DLL (an `import library').  This file can be created by giving the -l option to dlltool
       when it is creating or reading in a .def file.

       If the -y option is specified, dlltool generates a delay-import library that can be used instead of the
       normal import library to allow a program to link to the dll only as soon as an imported function is called
       for the first time. The resulting executable will need to be linked to the static delayimp library containing
       __delayLoadHelper2(), which in turn will import LoadLibraryA and GetProcAddress from kernel32.

       dlltool builds the library file by hand, but it builds the exports file by creating temporary files
       containing assembler statements and then assembling these.  The -S command line option can be used to specify
       the path to the assembler that dlltool will use, and the -f option can be used to pass specific flags to that
       assembler.  The -n can be used to prevent dlltool from deleting these temporary assembler files when it is
       done, and if -n is specified twice then this will prevent dlltool from deleting the temporary object files it
       used to build the library.

       Here is an example of creating a DLL from a source file dll.c and also creating a program (from an object
       file called program.o) that uses that DLL:

                 gcc -c dll.c
                 dlltool -e exports.o -l dll.lib dll.o
                 gcc dll.o exports.o -o dll.dll
                 gcc program.o dll.lib -o program

       dlltool may also be used to query an existing import library to determine the name of the DLL to which it is
       associated.  See the description of the -I or --identify option.

OPTIONS
       The command line options have the following meanings:

       -d filename
       --input-def filename
           Specifies the name of a .def file to be read in and processed.

       -b filename
       --base-file filename
           Specifies the name of a base file to be read in and processed.  The contents of this file will be added
           to the relocation section in the exports file generated by dlltool.

       -e filename
       --output-exp filename
           Specifies the name of the export file to be created by dlltool.

       -z filename
       --output-def filename
           Specifies the name of the .def file to be created by dlltool.

       -l filename
       --output-lib filename
           Specifies the name of the library file to be created by dlltool.

       -y filename
       --output-delaylib filename
           Specifies the name of the delay-import library file to be created by dlltool.

       --export-all-symbols
           Treat all global and weak defined symbols found in the input object files as symbols to be exported.
           There is a small list of symbols which are not exported by default; see the --no-default-excludes option.
           You may add to the list of symbols to not export by using the --exclude-symbols option.

       --no-export-all-symbols
           Only export symbols explicitly listed in an input .def file or in .drectve sections in the input object
           files.  This is the default behaviour.  The .drectve sections are created by dllexport attributes in the
           source code.

       --exclude-symbols list
           Do not export the symbols in list.  This is a list of symbol names separated by comma or colon
           characters.  The symbol names should not contain a leading underscore.  This is only meaningful when
           --export-all-symbols is used.

       --no-default-excludes
           When --export-all-symbols is used, it will by default avoid exporting certain special symbols.  The
           current list of symbols to avoid exporting is DllMain@12, DllEntryPoint@0, impure_ptr.  You may use the
           --no-default-excludes option to go ahead and export these special symbols.  This is only meaningful when
           --export-all-symbols is used.

       -S path
       --as path
           Specifies the path, including the filename, of the assembler to be used to create the exports file.

       -f options
       --as-flags options
           Specifies any specific command line options to be passed to the assembler when building the exports file.
           This option will work even if the -S option is not used.  This option only takes one argument, and if it
           occurs more than once on the command line, then later occurrences will override earlier occurrences.  So
           if it is necessary to pass multiple options to the assembler they should be enclosed in double quotes.

       -D name
       --dll-name name
           Specifies the name to be stored in the .def file as the name of the DLL when the -e option is used.  If
           this option is not present, then the filename given to the -e option will be used as the name of the DLL.

       -m machine
       -machine machine
           Specifies the type of machine for which the library file should be built.  dlltool has a built in default
           type, depending upon how it was created, but this option can be used to override that.  This is normally
           only useful when creating DLLs for an ARM processor, when the contents of the DLL are actually encode
           using Thumb instructions.

       -a
       --add-indirect
           Specifies that when dlltool is creating the exports file it should add a section which allows the
           exported functions to be referenced without using the import library.  Whatever the hell that means!

       -U
       --add-underscore
           Specifies that when dlltool is creating the exports file it should prepend an underscore to the names of
           all exported symbols.

       --no-leading-underscore
       --leading-underscore
           Specifies whether standard symbol should be forced to be prefixed, or not.

       --add-stdcall-underscore
           Specifies that when dlltool is creating the exports file it should prepend an underscore to the names of
           exported stdcall functions. Variable names and non-stdcall function names are not modified.  This option
           is useful when creating GNU-compatible import libs for third party DLLs that were built with MS-Windows
           tools.

       -k
       --kill-at
           Specifies that when dlltool is creating the exports file it should not append the string @ <number>.
           These numbers are called ordinal numbers and they represent another way of accessing the function in a
           DLL, other than by name.

       -A
       --add-stdcall-alias
           Specifies that when dlltool is creating the exports file it should add aliases for stdcall symbols
           without @ <number> in addition to the symbols with @ <number>.

       -p
       --ext-prefix-alias prefix
           Causes dlltool to create external aliases for all DLL imports with the specified prefix.  The aliases are
           created for both external and import symbols with no leading underscore.

       -x
       --no-idata4
           Specifies that when dlltool is creating the exports and library files it should omit the ".idata4"
           section.  This is for compatibility with certain operating systems.

       --use-nul-prefixed-import-tables
           Specifies that when dlltool is creating the exports and library files it should prefix the ".idata4" and
           ".idata5" by zero an element. This emulates old gnu import library generation of "dlltool". By default
           this option is turned off.

       -c
       --no-idata5
           Specifies that when dlltool is creating the exports and library files it should omit the ".idata5"
           section.  This is for compatibility with certain operating systems.

       -I filename
       --identify filename
           Specifies that dlltool should inspect the import library indicated by filename and report, on "stdout",
           the name(s) of the associated DLL(s).  This can be performed in addition to any other operations
           indicated by the other options and arguments.  dlltool fails if the import library does not exist or is
           not actually an import library. See also --identify-strict.

       --identify-strict
           Modifies the behavior of the --identify option, such that an error is reported if filename is associated
           with more than one DLL.

       -i
       --interwork
           Specifies that dlltool should mark the objects in the library file and exports file that it produces as
           supporting interworking between ARM and Thumb code.

       -n
       --nodelete
           Makes dlltool preserve the temporary assembler files it used to create the exports file.  If this option
           is repeated then dlltool will also preserve the temporary object files it uses to create the library
           file.

       -t prefix
       --temp-prefix prefix
           Makes dlltool use prefix when constructing the names of temporary assembler and object files.  By
           default, the temp file prefix is generated from the pid.

       -v
       --verbose
           Make dlltool describe what it is doing.

       -h
       --help
           Displays a list of command line options and then exits.

       -V
       --version
           Displays dlltool's version number and then exits.

       @file
           Read command-line options from file.  The options read are inserted in place of the original @file
           option.  If file does not exist, or cannot be read, then the option will be treated literally, and not
           removed.

           Options in file are separated by whitespace.  A whitespace character may be included in an option by
           surrounding the entire option in either single or double quotes.  Any character (including a backslash)
           may be included by prefixing the character to be included with a backslash.  The file may itself contain
           additional @file options; any such options will be processed recursively.
