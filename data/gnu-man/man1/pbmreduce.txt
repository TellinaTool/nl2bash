NAME
       pbmreduce - read a portable bitmap and reduce it N times

SYNOPSIS
       pbmreduce [-floyd|-fs|-threshold ] [-value val] N [pbmfile]

DESCRIPTION
       Reads a portable bitmap as input.  Reduces it by a factor of N, and produces a portable bitmap as output.

       pbmreduce duplicates a lot of the functionality of pgmtopbm; you could do something like pnmscale | pgmtopbm,
       but pbmreduce is a lot faster.

       pbmreduce can be used to  "re-halftone"  an  image.   Let's  say  you  have  a  scanner  that  only  produces
       black&white,  not  grayscale,  and  it does a terrible job of halftoning (most b&w scanners fit this descrip‐
       tion).  One way to fix the halftoning is to scan at the highest possible resolution, say 300  dpi,  and  then
       reduce by a factor of three or so using pbmreduce.  You can even correct the brightness of an image, by using
       the -value flag.

OPTIONS
       By default, the halftoning after the reduction is done via boustrophedonic Floyd-Steinberg  error  diffusion;
       however,  the  -threshold  flag  can  be used to specify simple thresholding.  This gives better results when
       reducing line drawings.

       The -value flag alters the thresholding value for all quantizations.  It should be a real  number  between  0
       and 1.  Above 0.5 means darker images; below 0.5 means lighter.

       All flags can be abbreviated to their shortest unique prefix.
