NAME
       hp-makeuri - Device URI Creation Utility

DESCRIPTION
       Creates device URIs for local and network connected printers for use with CUPS.

SYNOPSIS
       hp-makeuri [OPTIONS] [SERIAL NO.|USB ID|IP|DEVNODE]

SERIAL NO.|USB ID|IP|DEVNODE
       USB IDs (usb only):
              "xxx:yyy"  where  xxx  is  the USB bus ID and yyy is the USB device ID. The ':' and all leading zeroes
              must be present.  (Use the 'lsusb' command to obtain this information. See Note 1.)

       IPs (network only):
              IPv4 address "a.b.c.d" or "hostname"

       DEVNODE (parallel only):
              "/dev/parportX", X=0,1,2,...

       SERIAL NO. (usb and parallel only):
              "serial no."

OPTIONS
       To specify the port on a multi-port JetDirect:
              -p<port> or --port=<port> (Valid values are 1*, 2, and 3. *default)

       Show the CUPS URI only (quiet mode):
              -c or --cups

       Show the SANE URI only (quiet mode):
              -s or --sane

       Show the HP Fax URI only (quiet mode):
              -f or --fax

       Set the logging level:
              -l<level> or --logging=<level> <level>: none, info*, error, warn, debug (*default)

       Run in debug mode:
              -g (same as option: -ldebug)

       This help information:
              -h or --help

EXAMPLES
       USB:   $ hp-makeuri 001:002

       Network:
              $ hp-makeuri 66.35.250.209

       Parallel:
              $ hp-makeuri /dev/parport0

       USB or parallel (using serial number):
              $ hp-makeuri US123456789

NOTES
       1. Example using 'lsusb' to obtain USB bus ID and USB device ID (example only, the  values  you  obtain  will
       differ) :


          $ lsusb


          Bus 003 Device 011: ID 03f0:c202 Hewlett-Packard


          $ hp-makeuri 003:011


           (Note:  You  may  have  to  run 'lsusb' from /sbin or another location. Use '$ locate lsusb' to determine
       this.)
