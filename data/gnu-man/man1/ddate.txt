DDATE(1)                                     Emperor Norton User Command                                    DDATE(1)



NAME
       ddate - convert Gregorian dates to Discordian dates

SYNOPSIS
       ddate [+format] [date]

DESCRIPTION
       ddate prints the date in Discordian date format.

       If called with no arguments, ddate will get the current system date, convert this to the Discordian date for‐
       mat and print this on the standard output. Alternatively, a Gregorian date may be specified  on  the  command
       line, in the form of a numerical day, month and year.

       If  a  format  string  is specified, the Discordian date will be printed in a format specified by the string.
       This mechanism works similarly to the format string mechanism of date(1), only almost completely differently.
       The fields are:

       %A     Full name of the day of the week (i.e., Sweetmorn)

       %a     Abbreviated name of the day of the week (i.e., SM)

       %B     Full name of the season (i.e., Chaos)

       %b     Abbreviated name of the season (i.e., Chs)

       %d     Ordinal number of day in season (i.e., 23)

       %e     Cardinal number of day in season (i.e., 23rd)

       %H     Name of current Holyday, if any

       %N     Magic code to prevent rest of format from being printed unless today is a Holyday.

       %n     Newline

       %t     Tab

       %X     Number of days remaining until X-Day. (Not valid if the SubGenius options are not compiled in.)

       %{

       %}     Used  to  enclose the part of the string which is to be replaced with the words "St. Tib's Day" if the
              current day is St. Tib's Day.

       %.     Try it and see.

EXAMPLES
       % ddate
       Sweetmorn, Bureaucracy 42, 3161 YOLD

       % ddate +'Today is %{%A, the %e of %B%}, %Y. %N%nCelebrate %H'
       Today is Sweetmorn, the 42nd of Bureaucracy, 3161.

       % ddate +"It's %{%A, the %e of %B%}, %Y. %N%nCelebrate %H" 26 9 1995
       It's Prickle-Prickle, the 50th of Bureaucracy, 3161.
       Celebrate Bureflux

       % ddate +"Today's %{%A, the %e of %B%}, %Y. %N%nCelebrate %H" 29 2 1996
       Today's St. Tib's Day, 3162.


BUGS
       ddate(1) will produce undefined behavior if asked to produce the date for St. Tib's day and its format string
       does not contain the St. Tib's Day delimiters %{ and %}.


NOTE
       After  `X-Day'  passed without incident, the Church of the SubGenius declared that it had got the year upside
       down - X-Day is actually in 8661 AD rather than 1998 AD.  Thus, the True X-Day is Cfn 40, 9827.
