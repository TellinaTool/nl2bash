NAME
       aconnect - ALSA sequencer connection manager


SYNOPSIS
       aconnect [-d] [-options] sender receiver
       aconnect -i|-o [-options]
       aconnect -x


DESCRIPTION
       aconnect  is a utility to connect and disconnect two existing ports on ALSA sequencer system.  The ports with
       the arbitrary subscription permission, such as created by aseqview(1), can be connected to any (MIDI)  device
       ports using aconnect.  For example, to connect from port 64:0 to 65:0, run as follows:

           % aconnect 64:0 65:0

       The  connection  is  one-way, and the whole data to the sender port (64:0) is redirected to the receiver port
       (65:0).  When another port (e.g. 65:1) is attached to the same sender port, the data is sent to both receiver
       ports.  For disconnection, use -d option.

       % aconnect -d 64:0 65:0

       The address can be given using the client's name.

       % aconnect External:0 Emu8000:1

       Then  the  port  0 of the client matching with the string "External" is connected to the port 1 of the client
       matching with the "Emu8000".

       Another function of aconnect is to list the present ports on the given condition.  The input ports, which may
       become sender ports, can be listed with -i option.

       % aconnect -i
       client 0: 'System' [type=kernel]
           0 'Timer           '
           1 'Announce        '
       client 64: 'External MIDI-0' [type=kernel]
           0 'MIDI 0-0        '

       Similarly, to see the output ports, use -o flag.

       You  can  remove  all existing exported connections using -x option.  This function is useful for terminating
       the ALSA drivers, because the modules with sequencer connections cannot be unloaded unless their  connections
       are removed.


OPTIONS
   CONNECTION MANAGEMENT
       -d, --disconnect
              Disconnect the given subscription.

       -e, --exclusive
              Connect  ports  with exclusive mode.  Both sender and receiver ports can be no longer connected by any
              other ports.

       -r, --real queue
              Convert time-stamps of event packets to the current value of  the  given  real-time  queue.   This  is
              option  is,  however, not so useful, since the receiver port must use (not necessarily own) the speci‐
              fied queue.

       -t, --tick queue
              Like -r option, but time-stamps are converted to the current value of the given tick queue.


   LIST PORTS
       -i, --input
              List existing input (readable) ports.  This option is exclusive to -o.

       -o, --output
              List existing output (writable) ports.  This option is exclusive to -i.

       -l, --list
              List the current connection status.  The connected and connecting ports from/to each port  are  listed
              together.   The  suffix  flag  [ex]  means  the connection is exclusive.  The suffix flag [real:#] and
              [tick:#] mean the connection includes real-time and tick conversion on the listed queue, respectively.


   REMOVE ALL CONNECTIONS
       -x, --removeall
              Remove all exported connections.
