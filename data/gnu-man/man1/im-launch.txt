NAME
       im-launch - launch input method end execute session program

SYNOPSIS
       im-launch SESSION-PROGRAM


DESCRIPTION
       The im-launch command is used to start a input method framework server daemon such as ibus-daemon, set up the
       appropriate environment variables for the client programs, and execute SESSION-PROGRAM such as x-session-man‐
       ager.

       This  command  is  usually  not  invoked  from  the  console  of a normal user but is normally invoked by the
       /etc/X11/Xsession.d/70im-config_launch.


TROUBLESHOOT
       If you have any problem, see the first part of ~/.xsession-errors and look for the cause.  If you are running
       im-config while Debian (sid) system is undergoing a major library transition, you may need to manually set up
       ~/.xinputrc with adjusted library version number etc.  Please file a bug  report  to  the  im-config  package
       using reportbug(1) describing your resolution experience.
