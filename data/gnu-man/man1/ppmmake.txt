NAME
       ppmmake - create a pixmap of a specified size and color

SYNOPSIS
       ppmmake color width height

DESCRIPTION
       Produces a portable pixmap of the specified color, width, and height.

       The color can be specified in five ways:

       o      A name, assuming that a pointer to an X11-style color names file was compiled in.

       o      An X11-style hexadecimal specifier: rgb:r/g/b, where r g and b are each 1- to 4-digit hexadecimal num‐
              bers.

       o      An X11-style decimal specifier: rgbi:r/g/b, where r g and b are floating point numbers between  0  and
              1.

       o      For  backwards  compatibility,  an  old-X11-style  hexadecimal  number:  #rgb, #rrggbb, #rrrgggbbb, or
              #rrrrggggbbbb.

       o      For backwards compatibility, a triplet of numbers separated by commas: r,g,b, where  r  g  and  b  are
              floating  point  numbers  between  0 and 1.  (This style was added before MIT came up with the similar
              rgbi style.)
