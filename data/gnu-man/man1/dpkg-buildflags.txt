NAME
       dpkg-buildflags - returns build flags to use during package build

SYNOPSIS
       dpkg-buildflags [option...] [command]

DESCRIPTION
       dpkg-buildflags  is a tool to retrieve compilation flags to use during build of Debian packages.  The default
       flags are defined by the vendor but they can be extended/overriden in several ways:

       1.     system-wide with /etc/dpkg/buildflags.conf;

       2.     for the current user with $XDG_CONFIG_HOME/dpkg/buildflags.conf  where  $XDG_CONFIG_HOME  defaults  to
              $HOME/.config;

       3.     temporarily by the user with environment variables (see section ENVIRONMENT);

       4.     dynamically  by  the  package  maintainer with environment variables set via debian/rules (see section
              ENVIRONMENT).

       The configuration files can contain two types of directives:

       SET flag value
              Override the flag named flag to have the value value.

       STRIP flag value
              Strip from the flag named flag all the build flags listed in value.

       APPEND flag value
              Extend the flag named flag by appending the options given in value.   A  space  is  prepended  to  the
              appended value if the flag's current value is non-empty.

       PREPEND flag value
              Extend  the  flag  named  flag  by  prepending the options given in value.  A space is appended to the
              prepended value if the flag's current value is non-empty.

       The configuration files can contain comments on lines starting with a hash (#). Empty lines are also ignored.

COMMANDS
       --dump Print to standard output all compilation flags and their values. It prints one flag per line separated
              from its value by an equal sign ("flag=value"). This is the default action.

       --list Print  the  list of flags supported by the current vendor (one per line). See the SUPPORTED FLAGS sec‐
              tion for more information about them.

       --status
              Display any information that can be useful to explain the behaviour of dpkg-buildflags: relevant envi‐
              ronment variables, current vendor, state of all feature flags. Also print the resulting compiler flags
              with their origin.

              This is intended to be run from debian/rules, so that the build log keeps a clear trace of  the  build
              flags used. This can be useful to diagnose problems related to them.

       --export=format
              Print  to  standard output commands that can be used to export all the compilation flags for some par‐
              ticular tool. If the format value is not given, sh is assumed. Only compilation flags starting with an
              upper  case  character  are  included, others are assumed to not be suitable for the environment. Sup‐
              ported formats:

              sh     Shell commands to set and export all the compilation flags in the environment. The flag  values
                     are quoted so the output is ready for evaluation by a shell.

              cmdline
                     Arguments  to  pass  to  a build program's command line to use all the compilation flags (since
                     dpkg 1.17.0). The flag values are quoted in shell syntax.

              configure
                     This is a legacy alias for cmdline.

              make   Make directives to set and export all the compilation flags in the environment. Output  can  be
                     written to a makefile fragment and evaluated using an include directive.

       --get flag
              Print the value of the flag on standard output. Exits with 0 if the flag is known otherwise exits with
              1.

       --origin flag
              Print the origin of the value that is returned by --get. Exits with 0 if the flag is  known  otherwise
              exits with 1. The origin can be one of the following values:

              vendor the original flag set by the vendor is returned;

              system the flag is set/modified by a system-wide configuration;

              user   the flag is set/modified by a user-specific configuration;

              env    the flag is set/modified by an environment-specific configuration.

       --query-features area
              Print  the features enabled for a given area. The only currently recognized area is hardening, see the
              FEATURE AREAS section for more details.  Exits with 0 if the area is known otherwise exits with 1.

              The output is in RFC822 format, with one section per feature.  For example:

                Feature: pie
                Enabled: no

                Feature: stackprotector
                Enabled: yes

       --help Show the usage message and exit.

       --version
              Show the version and exit.

SUPPORTED FLAGS
       CFLAGS Options for the C compiler. The default value set by the vendor includes -g and the default  optimiza‐
              tion level (-O2 usually, or -O0 if the DEB_BUILD_OPTIONS environment variable defines noopt).

       CPPFLAGS
              Options for the C preprocessor. Default value: empty.

       CXXFLAGS
              Options for the C++ compiler. Same as CFLAGS.

       GCJFLAGS
              Options for the GNU Java compiler (gcj). A subset of CFLAGS.

       FFLAGS Options for the Fortran compiler. A subset of CFLAGS.

       LDFLAGS
              Options  passed  to  the  compiler when linking executables or shared objects (if the linker is called
              directly, then -Wl and , have to be stripped from these options). Default value: empty.

       New flags might be added in the future if the need arises (for example to support other languages).

FEATURE AREAS
   Hardening
       Several compile-time options (detailed below) can be used to help harden a resulting  binary  against  memory
       corruption  attacks,  or provide additional warning messages during compilation. Except as noted below, these
       are enabled by default for architectures that support them.

       Each hardening feature can be enabled and disabled  in  the  DEB_BUILD_MAINT_OPTIONS  environment  variable's
       hardening value with the "+" and "-" modifier. For example, to enable the "pie" feature and disable the "for‐
       tify" feature you can do this in debian/rules:

         export DEB_BUILD_MAINT_OPTIONS=hardening=+pie,-fortify

       The special feature all can be used to enable or disable all hardening features at the same time.  Thus  dis‐
       abling everything and enabling only "format" and "fortify" can be achieved with:

         export DEB_BUILD_MAINT_OPTIONS=hardening=-all,+format,+fortify

       format This  setting  (enabled by default) adds -Wformat -Werror=format-security to CFLAGS and CXXFLAGS. This
              will warn about improper format string uses, and will fail when format functions are  used  in  a  way
              that  represent  possible  security  problems.  At present, this warns about calls to printf and scanf
              functions where the format string is not a string literal and there are no  format  arguments,  as  in
              printf(foo);  instead of printf("%s", foo); This may be a security hole if the format string came from
              untrusted input and contains "%n".

       fortify
              This setting (enabled by default) adds -D_FORTIFY_SOURCE=2 to CPPFLAGS.  During  code  generation  the
              compiler  knows  a  great  deal  of  information  about buffer sizes (where possible), and attempts to
              replace insecure unlimited length buffer function calls with length-limited ones. This  is  especially
              useful  for  old,  crufty code.  Additionally, format strings in writable memory that contain '%n' are
              blocked. If an application depends on such a format string, it will need to be worked around.

              Note that for this option to have any effect, the source must also be compiled with -O1 or higher.  If
              the  environment variable DEB_BUILD_OPTIONS contains noopt, then fortify support will be disabled, due
              to new warnings being issued by glibc 2.16 and later.

       stackprotector
              This setting (enabled by default)  adds  -fstack-protector  --param=ssp-buffer-size=4  to  CFLAGS  and
              CXXFLAGS. This adds safety checks against stack overwrites. This renders many potential code injection
              attacks into aborting situations. In the best case this  turns  code  injection  vulnerabilities  into
              denial of service or into non-issues (depending on the application).

              This  feature requires linking against glibc (or another provider of __stack_chk_fail), so needs to be
              disabled when building with -nostdlib or -ffreestanding or similar.

       relro  This setting (enabled by default) adds -Wl,-z,relro to LDFLAGS.  During program load, several ELF mem‐
              ory  sections  need to be written to by the linker. This flags the loader to turn these sections read-
              only before turning over control to the program. Most notably this prevents GOT overwrite attacks.  If
              this option is disabled, bindnow will become disabled as well.

       bindnow
              This  setting  (disabled by default) adds -Wl,-z,now to LDFLAGS. During program load, all dynamic sym‐
              bols are resolved, allowing for the entire PLT to be marked read-only (due to relro above). The option
              cannot become enabled if relro is not enabled.

       pie    This setting (disabled by default) adds -fPIE to CFLAGS and CXXFLAGS, and -fPIE -pie to LDFLAGS. Posi‐
              tion Independent Executable are needed to take advantage of Address Space Layout  Randomization,  sup‐
              ported  by  some  kernel  versions. While ASLR can already be enforced for data areas in the stack and
              heap (brk and mmap), the code areas must be compiled as position-independent. Shared libraries already
              do  this  (-fPIC),  so  they gain ASLR automatically, but binary .text regions need to be build PIE to
              gain ASLR. When this happens, ROP (Return Oriented Programming) attacks are much  harder  since  there
              are no static locations to bounce off of during a memory corruption attack.

              This is not compatible with -fPIC so care must be taken when building shared objects.

              Additionally,  since PIE is implemented via a general register, some architectures (most notably i386)
              can see performance losses of up to 15% in very text-segment-heavy application workloads;  most  work‐
              loads  see  less  than 1%. Architectures with more general registers (e.g. amd64) do not see as high a
              worst-case penalty.

ENVIRONMENT
       There are 2 sets of environment variables doing the same operations, the first one (DEB_flag_op) should never
       be  used within debian/rules. It's meant for any user that wants to rebuild the source package with different
       build flags. The second set (DEB_flag_MAINT_op) should only be used in debian/rules by package maintainers to
       change the resulting build flags.

       DEB_flag_SET
       DEB_flag_MAINT_SET
              This variable can be used to force the value returned for the given flag.

       DEB_flag_STRIP
       DEB_flag_MAINT_STRIP
              This  variable can be used to provide a space separated list of options that will be stripped from the
              set of flags returned for the given flag.

       DEB_flag_APPEND
       DEB_flag_MAINT_APPEND
              This variable can be used to append supplementary options to the value returned for the given flag.

       DEB_flag_PREPEND
       DEB_flag_MAINT_PREPEND
              This variable can be used to prepend supplementary options to the value returned for the given flag.

       DEB_BUILD_MAINT_OPTIONS
              This variable can be used to disable/enable  various  hardening  build  flags  through  the  hardening
              option. See the FEATURE AREAS section for details.

FILES
   Configuration files
       /etc/dpkg/buildflags.conf
              System wide configuration file.

       $XDG_CONFIG_HOME/dpkg/buildflags.conf or $HOME/.config/dpkg/buildflags.conf
              User configuration file.

   Packaging support
       /usr/share/dpkg/buildflags.mk
              Makefile  snippet  that  will load (and optionally export) all flags supported by dpkg-buildflags into
              variables (since dpkg 1.16.1).

EXAMPLES
       To pass build flags to a build command in a makefile:

           $(MAKE) $(shell dpkg-buildflags --export=cmdline)

           ./configure $(shell dpkg-buildflags --export=cmdline)

       To set build flags in a shell script or shell fragment, "eval" can be used to interpret  the  output  and  to
       export the flags in the environment:

           eval "$(dpkg-buildflags --export=sh)" && make

       or to set the positional parameters to pass to a command:

           eval "set -- $(dpkg-buildflags --export=cmdline)"
           for dir in a b c; do (cd $dir && ./configure "$@" && make); done

   Usage in debian/rules
       You  should  call  dpkg-buildflags  or  include buildflags.mk from the debian/rules file to obtain the needed
       build flags to pass to the build system.  Note that older versions of dpkg-buildpackage (before dpkg  1.16.1)
       exported these flags automatically. However, you should not rely on this, since this breaks manual invocation
       of debian/rules.

       For packages with autoconf-like build systems, you can pass the relevant  options  to  configure  or  make(1)
       directly, as shown above.

       For  other  build systems, or when you need more fine-grained control about which flags are passed where, you
       can use --get. Or you can include buildflags.mk instead, which takes  care  of  calling  dpkg-buildflags  and
       storing the build flags in make variables.

       If you want to export all buildflags into the environment (where they can be picked up by your build system):

           DPKG_EXPORT_BUILDFLAGS = 1
           include /usr/share/dpkg/buildflags.mk

       For  some extra control over what is exported, you can manually export the variables (as none are exported by
       default):

           include /usr/share/dpkg/buildflags.mk
           export CPPFLAGS CFLAGS LDFLAGS

       And you can of course pass the flags to commands manually:

           include /usr/share/dpkg/buildflags.mk
           build-arch:
                $(CC) -o hello hello.c $(CPPFLAGS) $(CFLAGS) $(LDFLAGS)
