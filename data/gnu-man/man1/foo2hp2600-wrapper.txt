NAME
       foo2hp2600-wrapper - Convert Postscript into a ZJS printer stream

SYNOPSIS
       foo2hp2600-wrapper [options] [ps-file]

DESCRIPTION
       foo2hp2600-wrapper is a Foomatic compatible printer wrapper for the foo2hp printer driver.  This script reads
       a Postscript ps-file or standard input and converts it to Zenographics ZjStream printer  format  for  driving
       the Hewlett-Packard 2600n color laser printer and other Zenographics-based printers.

       This  script  can be used in a standalone fashion, but is intended to be called from a printer spooler system
       which uses the Foomatic printer database.

   Printer Tweaking Options
       These are the options used to customize the operation of foo2hp for a particular printer.

       -u xoffxyoff
              Set the offset of the start of the printable region from the upper left corner, in pixels [varies with
              paper size].  The defaults should work on the 2200DL and 2300DL, and have not been tested on any other
              printers.

       -l xoffxyoff
              Set  the offset of the end of the printable region from the lower right corner, in pixels [varies with
              paper size].  The defaults should work on the 2200DL and 2300DL, and have not been tested on any other
              printers.

       -L mask
              Send  the  logical  clipping values from -u/-l in the ZjStream.  foo2hp2600-wrapper always runs Ghost‐
              script with the ideal page dimensions, so that the scale of the image is correct,  regardless  whether
              or  not  the printer has unprintable regions.  This option is used to move the position of the clipped
              image back to where it belongs on the page.  The default is to send the amount which was clipped by -u
              and -l, and should be good in most cases.

              0   don't send any logical clipping amounts
              1   only send Y clipping amount
              2   only send X clipping amount
              3   send both X and Y clipping amounts

       -O parm=val
              Alignment  of  CMYK.   parm  is  c,  m,  y, or k.  val is in rows.  Multiple options are allowed.  The
              default is "-Oc=0 -Om=0 -Oy=0 -Ok=0".

       -P     Do not send START_PLANE codes on monochrome output.  May be needed by some  monochrome-only  printers,
              such as the HP LaserJet 1000.

       -X padlen
              Add  extra  zero  padding  to  the end of BID segments.  The default is 16 bytes.  Padding 16 bytes of
              zeroes is needed for older ZjStream printers, such as the Minolta 2200DL and  HP  LaserJet  1000,  and
              seems  harmless  to  newer  ones,  such  as the Minolta 2300DL.  So the default should be good for all
              cases.

       -z model
              Model: Model: 0=HP CLJ 1600/2600n; 1=HP CLJ CP1215

   Color Tweaking Options
       These are the options used to control the quality of color output.  Color correction is currently a  WORK  IN
       PROGRESS.

       -g gsopts
              Additional  options  to pass to Ghostscript, such as -g“-dDITHERPPI=nnn”, etc.  This option may appear
              more than once.

       -G profile.icm
              Convert profile.icm to a Postscript color rendering dictionary (CRD) using foo2zjs-icc2ps  and  adjust
              the  printer  colors  by using the Postscript setcolorrendering operator.  If profile.icm is none.icm,
              then prepare for ordering a ICM custom printer profile (i.e. from www.ICCFactory.com).

       -G gamma-file.ps
              Prepend gamma-file.ps to the Postscript input to perform color correction using  the  setcolortransfer
              Postscript operator.  For example, the file might contain:
              {0.333 exp} {0.333 exp} {0.333 exp} {0.333 exp} setcolortransfer

       -I intent
              Select  profile  intent  from  the  ICM file.  0=Perceptual, 1=Colorimetric, 2=Saturation, 3=Absolute.
              Default is 0 (perceptual).

   Debugging Options
       These options are used for debugging foo2hp and its wrapper.

       -S plane
              Output just a single color plane from a color print and print it on the black plane.  The  default  is
              to output all color planes.

              1   Cyan
              2   Magenta
              3   Yellow
              4   Black

       -D level
              Set Debug level [0].


EXAMPLES
       Create  a  monochrome  ZjStream  from  a Postscript document, examine it, and then print it using a RAW print
       queue:

              foo2hp2600-wrapper testpage.ps > testpage.zm
              zjsdecode < testpage.zm
              lpr -P raw testpage.zm

       Create a color ZjStream stream from a Postscript document:

              foo2hp2600-wrapper -c testpage.ps > testpage.zc
