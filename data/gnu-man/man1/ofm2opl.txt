NAME
       ofm2opl - convert Omega and TeX font-metric files to property-list files

SYNOPSIS
       ofm2opl [OPTIONS] OFMNAME[.ofm] [OPLFILE[.opl]]

DESCRIPTION
       ofm2opl  translates a binary Omega Font Metrics file, OFMNAME, into a human-readable property-list form.  The
       program writes to standard output (by default) or to a file specified as OPLFILE.

       The program also works with TeX TFM files, producing TeX PL files.  (ofm2opl is based on the WEB source  code
       for tftopl(1).)

OPTIONS
       -charcode-format=TYPE
              output  character  codes  according  to TYPE, which can be either `hex' or `ascii'.  Default is `hex'.
              ascii specifes all ASCII letters and digits; hex gets you everything else.

       -help  display a brief summary of syntax and options

       -verbose
              display progress reports

       -version
              output version information and exit

FILES
       OFMNAME
              an Omega Font Metric file

       OPLFILE
              an Omega Property List file

AUTHOR
       According to the WEB documentation:

              The  first  TFtoPL  program  was designed by Leo Guibas in the summer of 1978.  Contributions by Frank
              Liang, Doug Wyatt, and Lyle Ramshaw also had a significant effect on  the  evolution  of  the  present
              code.

              Extensions for an enhanced ligature mechanism were added by D.E. Knuth in 1989.

              Extensions  to  handle extended font metric files (``OFM'') were added by John Plaice in December 1995
              and January 1996, resulting in the new program OFM2OPL.
