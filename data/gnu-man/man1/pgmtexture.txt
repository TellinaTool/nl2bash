NAME
       pgmtexture - calculate textural features on a portable graymap

SYNOPSIS
       pgmtexture [-d d] [pgmfile]

DESCRIPTION
       Reads  a  portable graymap as input.  Calculates textural features based on spatial dependence matrices at 0,
       45, 90, and 135 degrees for a distance d (default = 1).  Textural features include:

              (1) Angular Second Moment,
              (2) Contrast,
              (3) Correlation,
              (4) Variance,
              (5) Inverse Difference Moment,
              (6) Sum Average,
              (7) Sum Variance,
              (8) Sum Entropy,
              (9) Entropy,
              (10) Difference Variance,
              (11) Difference Entropy,
              (12, 13) Information Measures of Correlation, and
              (14) Maximal Correlation Coefficient.

       Algorithm taken from:
       Haralick, R.M., K. Shanmugam, and I. Dinstein. 1973. Textural features for image classification.  IEEE Trans‐
       actions on Systems, Man, and Cybertinetics, SMC-3(6):610-621.

BUGS
       The  program can run incredibly slow for large images (larger than 64 x 64) and command line options are lim‐
       ited.  The method for finding (14) the maximal correlation coefficient, which  requires  finding  the  second
       largest eigenvalue of a matrix Q, does not always converge.
