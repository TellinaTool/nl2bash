AUTHOR
       According to the WEB documentation:

              VPtoVF is an extended version of the program PLtoTF, which is part of the  standard  TeXware  library.
              OVP2OVF  is  an  extended version of VPtoVF that allows much larger fonts.  The idea of a virtual font
              was inspired by the work of David R. Fuchs who designed a similar set of  conventions  in  1984  while
              developing a device driver for ArborText, Inc.  He wrote a somewhat similar program called PLFONT.
