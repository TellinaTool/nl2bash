NAME
       foo2slx-wrapper - Convert Postscript into a SLX printer stream

SYNOPSIS
       foo2slx-wrapper [options] [ps-file]

DESCRIPTION
       foo2slx-wrapper is a Foomatic compatible printer wrapper for the foo2slx printer driver.  This script reads a
       Postscript ps-file or standard input and converts it to Software Imaging K.K. SLX printer format for  driving
       the Lexmark C500 network color laser printer and other SLX-based printers.

       This  script  can be used in a standalone fashion, but is intended to be called from a printer spooler system
       which uses the Foomatic printer database.

   Printer Tweaking Options
       These are the options used to customize the operation of foo2slx for a particular printer.

       -u xoffxyoff
              Set the offset of the start of the printable region from the upper left corner, in pixels [varies with
              paper size].  The defaults should work on the 2200DL and 2300DL, and have not been tested on any other
              printers.

       -l xoffxyoff
              Set  the offset of the end of the printable region from the lower right corner, in pixels [varies with
              paper size].  The defaults should work on the 2200DL and 2300DL, and have not been tested on any other
              printers.

       -L mask
              Send  the logical clipping values from -u/-l in the ZjStream.  foo2slx-wrapper always runs Ghostscript
              with the ideal page dimensions, so that the scale of the image is correct, regardless whether  or  not
              the  printer  has  unprintable regions.  This option is used to move the position of the clipped image
              back to where it belongs on the page.  The default is to send the amount which was clipped by  -u  and
              -l, and should be good in most cases.

              0   don't send any logical clipping amounts
              1   only send Y clipping amount
              2   only send X clipping amount
              3   send both X and Y clipping amounts

   Color Tweaking Options
       These  are  the options used to control the quality of color output.  Color correction is currently a WORK IN
       PROGRESS.

       -g gsopts
              Additional options to pass to Ghostscript, such as -g“-dDITHERPPI=nnn”, etc.  This option  may  appear
              more than once.

       -G profile.icm
              Convert  profile.icm  to a Postscript color rendering dictionary (CRD) using foo2zjs-icc2ps and adjust
              the printer colors by using the Postscript setcolorrendering operator.  (WORK IN PROGRESS).

       -G gamma-file.ps
              Prepend gamma-file.ps to the Postscript input to perform color correction using  the  setcolortransfer
              Postscript operator.  For example, the file might contain:
              {0.333 exp} {0.333 exp} {0.333 exp} {0.333 exp} setcolortransfer

       -I intent
              Select  profile  intent  from  the  ICM file.  0=Perceptual, 1=Colorimetric, 2=Saturation, 3=Absolute.
              Default is 0 (perceptual).

   Debugging Options
       These options are used for debugging foo2slx and its wrapper.

       -S plane
              Output just a single color plane from a color print and print it on the black plane.  The  default  is
              to output all color planes.

              1   Cyan
              2   Magenta
              3   Yellow
              4   Black

       -D level
              Set Debug level [0].


EXAMPLES
       Create  a  monochrome  ZjStream  from  a Postscript document, examine it, and then print it using a RAW print
       queue:

              foo2slx-wrapper testpage.ps > testpage.zm
              slxdecode < testpage.zm
              lpr -P raw testpage.zm

       Create a color ZjStream stream from a Postscript document:

              foo2slx-wrapper -c testpage.ps > testpage.zc
