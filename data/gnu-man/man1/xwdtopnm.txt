xwdtopnm(1)                                    General Commands Manual                                   xwdtopnm(1)



NAME
       xwdtopnm - convert a X11 or X10 window dump file into a portable anymap

SYNOPSIS
       xwdtopnm [xwdfile]

DESCRIPTION
       Reads  a X11 or X10 window dump file as input.  Produces a portable anymap as output.  The type of the output
       file depends on the input file - if it's black & white, a pbm file is written, else if it's grayscale  a  pgm
       file, else a ppm file.  The program tells you which type it is writing.

       Using this program, you can convert anything on an X workstation's screen into an anymap.  Just display what‐
       ever you're interested in, do an xwd, run it through xwdtopnm, and then use pnmcut to  select  the  part  you
       want.

BUGS
       I  haven't tested this tool with very many configurations, so there are probably bugs.  Please let me know if
       you find any.
