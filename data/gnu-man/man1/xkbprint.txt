XKBPRINT(1)                                    General Commands Manual                                   XKBPRINT(1)



NAME
       xkbprint - print an XKB keyboard description

SYNOPSIS
       xkbprint [options] source [ output_file ]

DESCRIPTION
       The  xkbprint  command  generates  a  printable  or  encapsulated  PostScript description of the XKB keyboard
       description specified by source.  The source can be any compiled keymap (.xkm) file that includes a  geometry
       description  or  an  X  display specification.  If an output_file is specified, xkbprint writes to it.  If no
       output file is specified, xkbprint creates replaces the extension of the source file with .ps or .eps depend‐
       ing on the requested format.  If the source is a non-local X display (e.g.:0), xkbprint appends the appropri‐
       ate prefix to the display specification, replacing the colon with a dash.  For a local display, xkprint  uses
       server-n where n is the number of the display.
