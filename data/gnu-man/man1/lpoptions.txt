       lpoptions [ -E ] [ -U username ] [ -h server[:port] ] [ -o option[=value] ] ... [ -o option[=value]  ]  [  -p
       destination[/instance] ] -r option
       lpoptions [ -E ] [ -U username ] [ -h server[:port] ] -x destination[/instance]

DESCRIPTION
       lpoptions  displays  or  sets printer options and defaults.  lpoptions shows the default printer options when
       run with no arguments. Other options include:

       -E
            Enables encryption when communicating with the CUPS server.

       -U username
            Uses an alternate username.

       -d destination[/instance]
            Sets the user default printer to destination. If instance is supplied then that particular  instance  is
            used. This option overrides the system default printer for the current user.

       -h server[:port]
            Uses an alternate server.

       -l
            Lists the printer specific options and their current settings.

       -o option[=value]
            Specifies a new option for the named destination.

       -p destination[/instance]
            Sets the destination and instance, if specified, for any options that follow. If the named instance does
            not exist then it is created.

       -r option
            Removes the specified option for the named destination.

       -x destination[/instance]
            Removes the options for the named destination and instance, if specified. If the named instance does not
            exist then this does nothing.

       If  no options are specified using the -o option, then the current options for the named printer are reported
       on the standard output.

       Options set with the lpoptions command are used by the lp(1) and lpr(1) commands when submitting jobs.

ROOT ACCOUNT OPTIONS
       When run by the root user, lpoptions gets and sets default  options  and  instances  for  all  users  in  the
       /etc/cups/lpoptions file.

COMPATIBILITY
       The lpoptions command is unique to CUPS.

FILES
       ~/.cups/lpoptions - user defaults and instances created by non-root users.
       /etc/cups/lpoptions - system-wide defaults and instances created by the root user.
