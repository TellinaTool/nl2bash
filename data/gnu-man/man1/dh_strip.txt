NAME
       dh_strip - strip executables, shared libraries, and some static libraries

SYNOPSIS
       dh_strip [debhelper options] [-Xitem] [--dbg-package=package] [--keep-debug]

DESCRIPTION
       dh_strip is a debhelper program that is responsible for stripping executables, shared libraries, and static
       libraries that are not used for debugging.

       This program examines your package build directories and works out what to strip on its own. It uses file(1)
       and file permissions and filenames to figure out what files are shared libraries (*.so), executable binaries,
       and static (lib*.a) and debugging libraries (lib*_g.a, debug/*.so), and strips each as much as is possible.
       (Which is not at all for debugging libraries.) In general it seems to make very good guesses, and will do the
       right thing in almost all cases.

       Since it is very hard to automatically guess if a file is a module, and hard to determine how to strip a
       module, dh_strip does not currently deal with stripping binary modules such as .o files.

OPTIONS
       -Xitem, --exclude=item
           Exclude files that contain item anywhere in their filename from being stripped. You may use this option
           multiple times to build up a list of things to exclude.

       --dbg-package=package
           Causes dh_strip to save debug symbols stripped from the packages it acts on as independent files in the
           package build directory of the specified debugging package.

           For example, if your packages are libfoo and foo and you want to include a foo-dbg package with debugging
           symbols, use dh_strip --dbg-package=foo-dbg.

           Note that this option behaves significantly different in debhelper compatibility levels 4 and below.
           Instead of specifying the name of a debug package to put symbols in, it specifies a package (or packages)
           which should have separated debug symbols, and the separated symbols are placed in packages with -dbg
           added to their name.

       -k, --keep-debug
           Debug symbols will be retained, but split into an independent file in usr/lib/debug/ in the package build
           directory. --dbg-package is easier to use than this option, but this option is more flexible.

NOTES
       If the DEB_BUILD_OPTIONS environment variable contains nostrip, nothing will be stripped, in accordance with
       Debian policy (section 10.1 "Binaries").

CONFORMS TO
       Debian policy, version 3.0.1
