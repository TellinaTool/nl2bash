GNOME-SESSION(1)                               General Commands Manual                              GNOME-SESSION(1)



NAME
       gnome-session - Start the GNOME desktop environment

SYNOPSIS
       gnome-session [-a|--autostart=DIR] [--session=SESSION] [--failsafe|-f] [--debug] [--whale]

DESCRIPTION
       The gnome-session program starts up the GNOME desktop environment. This command is typically executed by your
       login manager (either gdm, xdm, or from your X startup scripts). It will load either your saved  session,  or
       it  will  provide a default session for the user as defined by the system administrator (or the default GNOME
       installation on your system).

       The default session is defined in gnome.session, a  .desktop-like  file  that  is  looked  for  in  $XDG_CON‐
       FIG_HOME/gnome-session/sessions,    $XDG_CONFIG_DIRS/gnome-session/sessions   and   $XDG_DATA_DIRS/gnome-ses‐
       sion/sessions.

       When saving a session, gnome-session saves the currently running applications in the  $XDG_CONFIG_HOME/gnome-
       session/saved-session directory.

       gnome-session is an X11R6 session manager. It can manage GNOME applications as well as any X11R6 SM compliant
       application.

OPTIONS
       The following options are supported:

       --autostart=DIR
              Start all applications defined in DIR, instead of starting the applications defined in  gnome.session,
              or via the --session option. Multiple --autostart options can be passed.

       --session=SESSION
              Use the applications defined in SESSION.session. If not specified, gnome.session will be used.

       --failsafe
              Run in fail-safe mode. User-specified applications will not be started.

       --debug
              Enable debugging code.

       --whale
              Show the fail whale in a dialog for debugging it.

SESSION DEFINITION
       Sessions are defined in .session files, that are using a .desktop-like format, with the following keys in the
       GNOME Session group:

       Name   Name of the session. This can be localized.

       RequiredComponents
              List of component identifiers (desktop files) that are required by the session.  The  required  compo‐
              nents will always run in the session.

       Here is an example of a session definition:

           [GNOME Session]
           Name=GNOME
           RequiredComponents=gnome-shell;gnome-settings-daemon;

       The  .session  files  are  looked for in $XDG_CONFIG_HOME/gnome-session/sessions, $XDG_CONFIG_DIRS/gnome-ses‐
       sion/sessions and $XDG_DATA_DIRS/gnome-session/sessions.

ENVIRONMENT
       gnome-session sets several environment variables for the use of its child processes:

       SESSION_MANAGER

              This variable is used by session-manager aware clients to contact gnome-session.

       DISPLAY

              This variable is set to the X display being used by gnome-session. Note that if the  --display  option
              is  used  this  might  be different from the setting of the environment variable when gnome-session is
              invoked.

FILES
       $XDG_CONFIG_HOME/config/autostart $XDG_CONFIG_DIRS/config/autostart /usr/share/gnome/autostart

              The applications defined in those directories will be started on  login.   gnome-session-properties(1)
              can be used to easily configure them.

       $XDG_CONFIG_HOME/gnome-session/sessions   $XDG_CONFIG_DIRS/gnome-session/sessions   $XDG_DATA_DIRS/gnome-ses‐
       sion/sessions

              These directories contain the .session files that can be used with the --session option.

       $XDG_CONFIG_HOME/gnome-session/saved-session

              This directory contains the list of applications of the saved session.
