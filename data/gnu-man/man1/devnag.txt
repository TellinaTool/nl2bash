NAME
       devnag - Devanagari for TeX preprocessor

SYNOPSIS
       devnag in[.dn] [out[.tex]]

DESCRIPTION
       devnag  is  a  preprocessor  that reads transliterated Devanagari input delimited by n and converts it into a
       form with which TeX is familiar.

       The preprocessor handles the details of character placement such as the alignment  of  vowel  diacritics  and
       consonant ligatures. The rest of the layout, however, must be managed by the user.

       For specification of the format please see the documentation accompanying the package.

OPTIONS
       in[.dn] out[.tex]
              The  default  file extension for an input file is .dn and for an output file .tex. The output filename
              is optional. If an output filename is not specified, the preprocessor will name  it  after  the  input
              file.
