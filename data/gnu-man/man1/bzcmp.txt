NAME
       bzcmp, bzdiff - compare bzip2 compressed files

SYNOPSIS
       bzcmp [ cmp_options ] file1 [ file2 ]
       bzdiff [ diff_options ] file1 [ file2 ]

DESCRIPTION
       Bzcmp and bzdiff are used to invoke the cmp or the diff program on bzip2 compressed files.  All options spec‐
       ified are passed directly to cmp or diff.  If only 1 file is specified, then the files compared are file1 and
       an  uncompressed  file1.bz2.   If two files are specified, then they are uncompressed if necessary and fed to
       cmp or diff.  The exit status from cmp or diff is preserved.

SEE ALSO
       cmp(1), diff(1), bzmore(1), bzless(1), bzgrep(1), bzip2(1)

BUGS
       Messages from the cmp or diff programs refer to temporary filenames instead of those specified.
