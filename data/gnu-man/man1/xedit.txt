SYNTAX
       xedit [ -toolkitoption ... ] [ filename ... ]

                                into the edit window.

       Message Window           Displays xedit messages. In addition, this window can be also used as a scratch pad.

       Edit Window              Displays the text of the file that you are editing or creating.

OPTIONS
       Xedit  accepts  all of the standard X Toolkit command line options (see X(7)).  The order of the command line
       options is not important.

               Specifies the file(s) that are to be loaded during start-up. This is the file which will  be  edited.
