NAME
       ppmtompeg - encodes MPEG-1 bitstreams

SYNOPSIS
       ppmtompeg [ options ] parameter-file

DESCRIPTION
       ppmtompeg  produces  an  MPEG-1  video stream.  param_file is a parameter file which includes a list of input
       files and other parameters.  The file is described in detail below.  The -gop,  -combine_gops,  -frames,  and
       -combine_frames  options  are  all exclusive.  This man page is probably incomplete.  For complete usage, see
       the User's Guide.

OPTIONS
       -stat stat_file : causes the encoder to append the statistics to the file stat_file.  In any case,  the  sta‐
              tistics  are output to stdout.  The statistics use the following abbreviations:  bits per block (bpb),
              bits per frame (bpf), seconds per frame (spf), and bits per second (bps).

       -quiet num_seconds : causes the program to not report remaining time for at  least  num_seconds  seconds.   A
              negative  values  tells  the  program not to report at all.  0 is the default (reports once after each
              frame).  Note that the time remaining is an estimate and does not take into account time  to  read  in
              frames.

       -realquiet : causes the encoder to run silently, with the only screen output being errors.  Particularly use‐
              ful when reading input from stdin.

       -no_frame_summary : prevents the program from printing a summary line for each frame

       -float_dct : forces the encoder to use a more accurate, yet more computationally  expensive  version  of  the
              DCT.

       -gop  gop_num  :  causes the encoder to only encode the numbered GOP (first GOP is 0).  The parameter file is
              the same as for normal usage.  The output file  will  be  the  normal  output  file  with  the  suffix
              ".gop.<gop_num>"  No sequence info is output.

       -combine_gops  :  causes  the encoder to simply combine some GOP files into a single MPEG stream.  A sequence
              header/ender are inserted.  In this case, the parameter file need only contain the YUV_SIZE value,  an
              output file, and perhaps a list of input GOP files (see below).

       -frames first_frame last_frame : causes the encoder to only encode the frames from first_frame to last_frame,
              inclusive.  The parameter file is the same as for normal usage.  The output will be placed in separate
              files,  one per frame, with the file names being the normal output file with the suffix ".frame.<frame
              num>"  No GOP header information is output.  (Thus, the parameter file need not include  the  GOP_SIZE
              value)

       -combine_frames  :  causes the encoder to simply combine some frames into a single MPEG stream.  Sequence and
              GOP headers are inserted appropriately.  In this case,  the  parameter  file  need  only  contain  the
              YUV_SIZE value, the GOP_SIZE value, an output file, and perhaps a list of frame files (see below).

       -nice  :  causes  the  program to run any remote processes 'nicely.'  This is only relevant if the program is
              using parallel encoding.  (see 'man nice.')

       -max_machines num_machines : causes the program to use no more than num_machines machines as slaves  for  use
              in parallel encoding.

       -snr : print the signal-to-noise ratio.  Prints SNR (Y U V) and peak SNR (Y U V) for each frame.  In summary,
              prints averages of luminance only (Y).  SNR is defined  as  10*log(variance  of  original/variance  of
              error).   Peak  SNR is defined as 20*log(255/RMSE).  Note that the encoder will run a little slower if
              you want it to print the SNR.

       -mse : computes the mean squared error per block.  Also automatically computes the quality of the images when
              set, so there is no need to specify -snr then.

       -bit_rate_info  rate_file  :  prints bit rate information into the file rate_file.  Bit rate info is bits per
              frame, and also bits per I-frame-to-I-frame.

       -mv-histogram : prints histogram of motion vectors as part of statistics.  There are three histograms --  one
              for  P,  forward B, and backward B vectors.  Each histogram is a 2-dimensional array, and there is one
              entry for each vector in the search window.



PARAMETER FILE
       The parameter file MUST contain the following lines (except when using the -combine_gops  or  -combine_frames
       options):


              PATTERN <pattern>

              OUTPUT <output file>

              INPUT_DIR <directory>
                     all  input files must reside in this directory.  If you want to refer to the current directory,
                     use '.' (an empty INPUT_DIR value would refer to the root directory).  If input files  will  be
                     coming in from standard input, use 'stdin'.

              INPUT
                     This line must be followed by a list of the input files (in display order) and then the line
                            END_INPUT
                     There  are  three  types of lines between INPUT and END_INPUT.  First, a line may simply be the
                     name of an input file.  Secondly, the line may be of the form
                            <single_star_expr> [x-y]
                     single_star_expr can have a single '*' in it.  It is replaced by all the numbers between x  and
                     y inclusive.  So, for example, the line
                            tennis*.ppm [12-15]
                     is  replaced  by  tennis12.ppm, tennis13.ppm, tennis14.ppm, tennis15.ppm.  Uniform zero-padding
                     occurs, as well.  For example, the line
                            football.*.ppm [001-130]
                     is replaced by football.001.ppm,  football.002.ppm,  ...,  football.009.ppm,  football.010.ppm,
                     ..., football.130.ppm.  The third type of line is:
                            <single_star_expr> [x-y+s]
                     Where the line is treated exactly as above, except that we skip by s.  Thus, the line
                            football.*.ppm [001-130+4]
                     is replaced by football.001.ppm, football.005.ppm, football.009.ppm, football.013.ppm, etc.

              BASE_FILE_FORMAT <YUV or PPM or PNM or JPEG or JMOVIE>
                     All  the input files must be converted to YUV, JPEG(v4), JMOVIE, PNM, or PPM format.  This line
                     specifies which of the three formats (actually PPM is a subset of PNM).  The reason for  having
                     a separate PPM option is for simplicity.  If your files are RAWBITS ppm files, then use the PPM
                     option rather than the PNM.  Also, depending on the system, file reads will go much faster with
                     the PPM option (as opposed to PNM).

              INPUT_CONVERT <conversion command>
                     You  must  specify  how  to convert a file to the base file format.  In the conversion command,
                     each '*' is replaced by the filename (the items listed between INPUT  and  END_INPUT).   If  no
                     conversion is necessary, then you would just say:
                            INPUT_CONVERT *
                     If you had a bunch of gif files, you might say:
                            INPUT_CONVERT giftoppm *
                     If you have a bunch of separate a.Y, a.U, and a.V files, then you might say:
                            INPUT_CONVERT cat *.Y *.U *.V
                            Input conversion is not allowed with input from stdin.

                     GOP_SIZE <n>
                            n  is  roughly  the  number of frames in a Group of Pictures (roughly because a GOP must
                            begin with an I-frame)

                     SLICES_PER_FRAME <n>
                            n is roughly the number of slices per frame.  Note, at least one MPEG  player  may  com‐
                            plain if slices do not start at the left side of an image.  To ensure this does not hap‐
                            pen, make sure the number of rows is divisible by SLICES_PER_FRAME.

                     PIXEL <FULL or HALF>
                            use half-pixel motion vectors, or only full-pixel ones

                     RANGE <n>
                            use a search range of +/- n pixels

                     PSEARCH_ALG <algorithm>
                            algorithm must be one of {EXHAUSTIVE, TWOLEVEL,  SUBSAMPLE,  LOGARITHMIC}.   Tells  what
                            kind  of  search  procedure should be used for P-frames.  Exhaustive gives the best com‐
                            pression, but logarithmic is the fastest.  You select the desired combination  of  speed
                            and compression.  TWOLEVEL is an exhaustive full-pixel search, followed by a local half-
                            pixel search around the best full-pixel vector (the PIXEL option  is  ignored  for  this
                            search algorithm).

                     BSEARCH_ALG <algorithm>
                            algorithm must be one of {SIMPLE, CROSS2, EXHAUSTIVE}.  Tells what kind of search proce‐
                            dure should be used for B-frames.  Simple means find best forward and backward  vectors,
                            then  interpolate.   Cross2  means find those two vectors, then see what backward vector
                            best matches the best forward vector, and vice  versa.   Exhaustive  does  an  n-squared
                            search and is EXTREMELY slow in relation to the others (Cross2 is about twice as slow as
                            Simple).

                     IQSCALE <n>
                            use n as the qscale for I-frames

                     PQSCALE <n>
                            use n as the qscale for P-frames

                     BQSCALE <n>
                            use n as the qscale for B-frames

                     REFERENCE_FRAME <ORIGINAL or DECODED>
                            If ORIGINAL is specified, then the original images are used when computing  motion  vec‐
                            tors.   To  be  more  accurate, use DECODED, in which the decoded images are used.  This
                            should increase the quality of the image, but will take a bit longer to encode.
                     The following lines are optional:


                            FORCE_I_ALIGN
                                   This option is only relevant for parallel execution (see below).  It forces  each
                                   processor  to  encode a block of N frames, where N must be a multiple of the pat‐
                                   tern length.  Since the first frame in any pattern is  an  I-frame,  this  forces
                                   each block encoded by a processor to begin with an I-frame.
                            foo



NOTES
       If the BASE_FILE_FORMAT is YUV, then the parameter file must contain:
              YUV_SIZE <w>x<h>
       where w = width, h = height (in pixels) of image, and
              YUV_FORMAT <ABEKAS or PHILLIPS or UCB or EYUV or pattern>.
       See the file doc/INPUT.FORMAT for more information.

       If the -combine-gops option is used, then only the YUV_SIZE and OUTPUT values need be specified in the param‐
       eter file.  In addition, the parameter file may specify input GOP files in the same manner  as  normal  input
       files  --  except  instead  of  using  INPUT_DIR,  INPUT,  and  END_INPUT,  use GOP_INPUT_DIR, GOP_INPUT, and
       GOP_END_INPUT.  If no input GOP files are specified, then the default is to use the  output  file  name  with
       suffix ".gop.<gop_num>" starting from 0 as the input files.

       If  the -combine-frames option is used, then only the YUV_SIZE, GOP_SIZE, and OUTPUT values need be specified
       in the parameter file.  In addition, the parameter file may specify input frame files in the same  manner  as
       normal  input  files  --  except  instead  of  using  INPUT_DIR,  INPUT,  and END_INPUT, use FRAME_INPUT_DIR,
       FRAME_INPUT, and FRAME_END_INPUT.  If no input frame files are specified, then the default is to use the out‐
       put file name with suffix ".frame.<frame_num>" starting from 0 as the input files.

       Any  number of spaces and tabs may come between each option and value.  Lines beginning with '#' are ignored.
       Any other lines are ignored except for those between INPUT and END_INPUT.  This allows you to  use  the  same
       parameter file for normal usage and for -combine_gops and -combine_frames.

       The encoder is case-sensitive so, except for file names and directories, everything should be in upper case.

       The  lines  may  appear  in  any  order, except the following exceptions.  INPUT must appear before END_INPUT
       (also, GOP_INPUT before GOP_END_INPUT and FRAME_INPUT before FRAME_END_INPUT).  All lines between  INPUT  and
       END_INPUT must be the frames in play order.

       The  encoder  is  prepared to handle up to 16 B frames between reference frames when encoding with input from
       stdin.  To increase this amount, change the constant B_FRAME_RUN in frame.c and recompile.



PARALLEL OPERATION
       The encoder may be run on multiple machines at once.  To do so, add a line "PARALLEL" in the parameter  file,
       followed  by a listing, one machine per line, then "END_PARALLEL".  Each of the lines should be in one of two
       forms.  If the machine has access to the file server, then the line should be:

            <machine> <user> <executable>

       The executable is normally ppmtompeg (you may need to give the complete path if you've  built  for  different
       architectures).  If the machine is a remote machine, then the line should be:

            REMOTE <machine> <user> <executable> <parameter file>

       Full  paths  should  generally  be  used  when describing executables and parameter files.  This INCLUDES the
       parameter file given as an argument to the original call to ppmtompeg.  Also, .rhosts files on the  appropri‐
       ate machines should have the appropriate information.

       The  encoder  will  use  the  original  machine  for the master and I/O server processes, and uses the listed
       machines as slaves to do the computation.

       Optional lines are

       RSH <remote shell command>
              The encoder uses the remote shell command to start processes on other machines.  The  default  command
              is 'rsh.'  If your machine supports a different command, specify it here.

       PARALLEL_TEST_FRAMES <n>
              n is the number of frames to encode initially on each processor

       PARALLEL_TIME_CHUNKS <t>
              subsequently,  each slave processor will be asked to encode for approximately t seconds.  Smaller val‐
              ues of <t> increase communication, but improve load balancing.

              The default values for these two options are n = 3 frames and t = 30 seconds.

       PARALLEL_PERFECT
              If this line is present, then scheduling is done on the assumption that work distribution will be per‐
              fectly  even  -- meaning that each machine is about the same speed.  The frames will simply be divided
              up evenly between the processors.  This has the advantage of very minimal scheduling overhead, but  is
              obviously wrong if machines have varying speeds, or if the network load makes performance uneven.

VERSION
       This is version 1.5 it contins new features and bug fixes from version 1.3.

BUGS
       Not  really  a  bug, but at least a limitation: If writing to an output file, ppmtompeg sometimes uses <file‐
       name>.* as temporary files.

       No known bugs, but if you find any, report them to mpeg-bugs@plateau.cs.berkeley.edu.
