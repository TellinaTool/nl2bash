NAME
       xstdcmap - X standard colormap utility

SYNOPSIS
       xstdcmap  [-all]  [-best] [-blue] [-default] [-delete map] [-display display] [-gray] [-green] [-help] [-red]
       [-verbose] [-version]

DESCRIPTION
       The xstdcmap utility can be used to selectively define standard colormap properties.  It is  intended  to  be
       run  from a user's X startup script to create standard colormap definitions in order to facilitate sharing of
       scarce colormap resources among clients.  Where at all possible, colormaps are created with read-only alloca‐
       tions.

OPTIONS
       The following options may be used with xstdcmap:

       -all    This  option  indicates that all six standard colormap properties should be defined on each screen of
               the display.  Not all screens will support visuals under which all six standard  colormap  properties
               are meaningful.  xstdcmap will determine the best allocations and visuals for the colormap properties
               of a screen. Any previously existing standard colormap properties will be replaced.

       -best   This option indicates that the RGB_BEST_MAP should be defined.

       -blue   This option indicates that the RGB_BLUE_MAP should be defined.

       -default
               This option indicates that the RGB_DEFAULT_MAP should be defined.

       -delete map
               This option specifies that a specific standard colormap property, or all such properties,  should  be
               removed.  map may be one of: default, best, red, green, blue, gray, or all.

       -display display
               This option specifies the host and display to use; see X(7).

       -gray   This option indicates that the RGB_GRAY_MAP should be defined.

       -green  This option indicates that the RGB_GREEN_MAP should be defined.

       -help   This option indicates that a brief description of the command line arguments should be printed on the
               standard error.  This will be done whenever an unhandled argument is given to xstdcmap.

       -red    This option indicates that the RGB_RED_MAP should be defined.

       -verbose
               This option indicates that xstdcmap should print logging information  as  it  parses  its  input  and
               defines the standard colormap properties.

       -version
               This option indicates that xstdcmap should print its version and exit.

ENVIRONMENT
       DISPLAY to get default host and display number.
