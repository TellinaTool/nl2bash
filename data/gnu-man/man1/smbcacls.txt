DESCRIPTION
       This tool is part of the samba(7) suite.

       The smbcacls program manipulates NT Access Control Lists (ACLs) on SMB file shares. An ACL is comprised zero
       or more Access Control Entries (ACEs), which define access restrictions for a specific user or group.

OPTIONS
       The following options are available to the smbcacls program. The format of ACLs is described in the section
       ACL FORMAT

       -a|--add acl
           Add the entries specified to the ACL. Existing access control entries are unchanged.

       -M|--modify acl
           Modify the mask value (permissions) for the ACEs specified on the command line. An error will be printed
           for each ACE specified that was not already present in the object's ACL.

       -D|--delete acl
           Delete any ACEs specified on the command line. An error will be printed for each ACE specified that was
           not already present in the object's ACL.

       -S|--set acl
           This command sets the ACL on the object with only what is specified on the command line. Any existing ACL
           is erased. Note that the ACL specified must contain at least a revision, type, owner and group for the
           call to succeed.

       -C|--chown name
           The owner of a file or directory can be changed to the name given using the -C option. The name can be a
           sid in the form S-1-x-y-z or a name resolved against the server specified in the first argument.

           This command is a shortcut for -M OWNER:name.

       -G|--chgrp name
           The group owner of a file or directory can be changed to the name given using the -G option. The name can
           be a sid in the form S-1-x-y-z or a name resolved against the server specified n the first argument.

           This command is a shortcut for -M GROUP:name.

       -I|--inherit allow|remove|copy
           Set or unset the windows "Allow inheritable permissions" check box using the -I option. To set the check
           box pass allow. To unset the check box pass either remove or copy. Remove will remove all inherited acls.
           Copy will copy all the inherited acls.

       --numeric
           This option displays all ACL information in numeric format. The default is to convert SIDs to names and
           ACE types and masks to a readable string format.

       -m|--max-protocol PROTOCOL_NAME
           This allows the user to select the highest SMB protocol level that smbcacls will use to connect to the
           server. By default this is set to NT1, which is the highest available SMB1 protocol. To connect using
           SMB2 or SMB3 protocol, use the strings SMB2 or SMB3 respectively. Note that to connect to a Windows 2012
           server with encrypted transport selecting a max-protocol of SMB3 is required.

       -t|--test-args
           Don't actually do anything, only validate the correctness of the arguments.

       --query-security-info FLAGS
           The security-info flags for queries.

       --set-security-info FLAGS
           The security-info flags for queries.

       --sddl
           Output and input acls in sddl format.

       --domain-sid SID
           SID used for sddl processing.

       -d|--debuglevel=level
           level is an integer from 0 to 10. The default value if this parameter is not specified is 0.

           The higher this value, the more detail will be logged to the log files about the activities of the
           server. At level 0, only critical errors and serious warnings will be logged. Level 1 is a reasonable
           level for day-to-day running - it generates a small amount of information about operations carried out.

           Levels above 1 will generate considerable amounts of log data, and should only be used when investigating
           a problem. Levels above 3 are designed for use only by developers and generate HUGE amounts of log data,
           most of which is extremely cryptic.

           Note that specifying this parameter here will override the log level parameter in the smb.conf file.

       -V|--version
           Prints the program version number.

       -s|--configfile=<configuration file>
           The file specified contains the configuration details required by the server. The information in this
           file includes server-specific information such as what printcap file to use, as well as descriptions of
           all the services that the server is to provide. See smb.conf for more information. The default
           configuration file name is determined at compile time.

       -l|--log-basename=logdirectory
           Base directory name for log/debug files. The extension ".progname" will be appended (e.g. log.smbclient,
           log.smbd, etc...). The log file is never removed by the client.

       --option=<name>=<value>
           Set the smb.conf(5) option "<name>" to value "<value>" from the command line. This overrides compiled-in
           defaults and options read from the configuration file.

       -N|--no-pass
           If specified, this parameter suppresses the normal password prompt from the client to the user. This is
           useful when accessing a service that does not require a password.

           Unless a password is specified on the command line or this parameter is specified, the client will
           request a password.

           If a password is specified on the command line and this option is also defined the password on the
           command line will be silently ingnored and no password will be used.

       -k|--kerberos
           Try to authenticate with kerberos. Only useful in an Active Directory environment.

       -C|--use-ccache
           Try to use the credentials cached by winbind.

       -A|--authentication-file=filename
           This option allows you to specify a file from which to read the username and password used in the
           connection. The format of the file is

               username = <value>
               password = <value>
               domain   = <value>

           Make certain that the permissions on the file restrict access from unwanted users.

       -U|--user=username[%password]
           Sets the SMB username or username and password.

           If %password is not specified, the user will be prompted. The client will first check the USER
           environment variable, then the LOGNAME variable and if either exists, the string is uppercased. If these
           environmental variables are not found, the username GUEST is used.

           A third option is to use a credentials file which contains the plaintext of the username and password.
           This option is mainly provided for scripts where the admin does not wish to pass the credentials on the
           command line or via environment variables. If this method is used, make certain that the permissions on
           the file restrict access from unwanted users. See the -A for more details.

           Be cautious about including passwords in scripts. Also, on many systems the command line of a running
           process may be seen via the ps command. To be safe always allow rpcclient to prompt for a password and
           type it in directly.

       -S|--signing on|off|required
           Set the client signing state.

       -P|--machine-pass
           Use stored machine account password.

       -e|--encrypt
           This command line parameter requires the remote server support the UNIX extensions or that the SMB3
           protocol has been selected. Requests that the connection be encrypted. Negotiates SMB encryption using
           either SMB3 or POSIX extensions via GSSAPI. Uses the given credentials for the encryption negotiation
           (either kerberos or NTLMv1/v2 if given domain/username/password triple. Fails the connection if
           encryption cannot be negotiated.

       --pw-nt-hash
           The supplied password is the NT hash.

       -n|--netbiosname <primary NetBIOS name>
           This option allows you to override the NetBIOS name that Samba uses for itself. This is identical to
           setting the netbios name parameter in the smb.conf file. However, a command line setting will take
           precedence over settings in smb.conf.

       -i|--scope <scope>
           This specifies a NetBIOS scope that nmblookup will use to communicate with when generating NetBIOS names.
           For details on the use of NetBIOS scopes, see rfc1001.txt and rfc1002.txt. NetBIOS scopes are very rarely
           used, only set this parameter if you are the system administrator in charge of all the NetBIOS systems
           you communicate with.

       -W|--workgroup=domain
           Set the SMB domain of the username. This overrides the default domain which is the domain defined in
           smb.conf. If the domain specified is the same as the servers NetBIOS name, it causes the client to log on
           using the servers local SAM (as opposed to the Domain SAM).

       -O|--socket-options socket options
           TCP socket options to set on the client socket. See the socket options parameter in the smb.conf manual
           page for the list of valid options.

       -?|--help
           Print a summary of command line options.

       --usage
           Display brief usage message.

ACL FORMAT
       The format of an ACL is one or more entries separated by either commas or newlines. An ACL entry is one of
       the following:

           REVISION:<revision number>
           OWNER:<sid or name>
           GROUP:<sid or name>
           ACL:<sid or name>:<type>/<flags>/<mask>

       The revision of the ACL specifies the internal Windows NT ACL revision for the security descriptor. If not
       specified it defaults to 1. Using values other than 1 may cause strange behaviour.

       The owner and group specify the owner and group sids for the object. If a SID in the format S-1-x-y-z is
       specified this is used, otherwise the name specified is resolved using the server on which the file or
       directory resides.

       ACEs are specified with an "ACL:" prefix, and define permissions granted to an SID. The SID again can be
       specified in S-1-x-y-z format or as a name in which case it is resolved against the server on which the file
       or directory resides. The type, flags and mask values determine the type of access granted to the SID.

       The type can be either ALLOWED or DENIED to allow/deny access to the SID. The flags values are generally zero
       for file ACEs and either 9 or 2 for directory ACEs. Some common flags are:

       ·   #define SEC_ACE_FLAG_OBJECT_INHERIT 0x1

       ·   #define SEC_ACE_FLAG_CONTAINER_INHERIT 0x2

       ·   #define SEC_ACE_FLAG_NO_PROPAGATE_INHERIT 0x4

       ·   #define SEC_ACE_FLAG_INHERIT_ONLY 0x8


       At present, flags can only be specified as decimal or hexadecimal values.

       The mask is a value which expresses the access right granted to the SID. It can be given as a decimal or
       hexadecimal value, or by using one of the following text strings which map to the NT file permissions of the
       same name.

       ·   R - Allow read access

       ·   W - Allow write access

       ·   X - Execute permission on the object

       ·   D - Delete the object

       ·   P - Change permissions

       ·   O - Take ownership


       The following combined permissions can be specified:

       ·   READ - Equivalent to 'RX' permissions

       ·   CHANGE - Equivalent to 'RXWD' permissions

       ·   FULL - Equivalent to 'RWXDPO' permissions

EXIT STATUS
       The smbcacls program sets the exit status depending on the success or otherwise of the operations performed.
       The exit status may be one of the following values.

       If the operation succeeded, smbcacls returns and exit status of 0. If smbcacls couldn't connect to the
       specified server, or there was an error getting or setting the ACLs, an exit status of 1 is returned. If
       there was an error parsing any command line arguments, an exit status of 2 is returned.

VERSION
       This man page is correct for version 4 of the Samba suite.
