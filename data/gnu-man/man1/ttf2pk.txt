NAME
       ttf2pk - convert a TrueType font into TeX's PK format

SYNOPSIS
       ttf2pk [-q] [-n] font-name resolution
       ttf2pk -t [-q] font-name
       ttf2pk --version | --help

DESCRIPTION
       This program converts a TrueType font into a PK file; the created font can then be used with TeX or LaTeX.

       CJKV (Chinese/Japanese/Korean/old Vietnamese) subfonts as created by ttf2tfm are also supported.

       ttf2pk always assumes 10pt as the design size for the written TeX font.

PARAMETERS
       -q     This  optional  switch  makes ttf2pk quiet.  It suppresses any informational output except warning and
              error messages.

       -n     Use only `.pk' as the extension instead of `.<resolution>pk'.

       -t     Test for the existence of font-name.  Returns 0 on success and prints out the corresponding line of  a
              map file (default: ttfonts.map), provided the -q switch isn't set.

       font-name
              The TeX name of the font.  ttf2pk looks this name up in a map file (see below) for further information
              how to process the font.

       resolution
              The resolution, given in dots per inch.  Currently the horizontal resolution is equal to the  vertical
              resolution.  The design size is always assumed to be 10pt.

       --version
              Shows the current version of ttf2pk and the used file search library (e.g. kpathsea).

       --help Shows usage information.

       Environment variables for file searching are described in the manual page of ttf2tfm.

THE CONFIGURATION FILE
       ttf2pk  uses a small configuration file called ttf2pk.cfg; in each line it contains a keyword with its value,
       separated by whitespace.  Comment lines can start with any of the following characters: `*',  `#',  `;',  and
       `%'.  Leading whitespace is ignored.

       Currently,  only one keyword, `map', is recognized in this file; it takes a map file name as a parameter.  If
       no extension is given to the map file name, .map is appended.  No whitespace is allowed in the map file name.
       The `map' keyword can be given more than once to specify multiple map files; if the map file name is prepend‐
       ed by a plus sign, it is added to the list of map files to be used.  Example:

         map  foo
         map +bar

       This makes ttf2pk to first read foo.map, then bar.map.

       If the configuration file is not found, ttf2pk tries to use ttfonts.map instead.

MAP FILES
       Parameters specified to ttf2tfm are preserved for ttf2pk in map files—ttf2tfm writes out to standard  output,
       as the last line, a proper entry for a map file.

       As an example, a call to

         ttf2tfm arial -p T1.enc -s 0.25 -P 1 -E 0 arials

       will produce the following line:

         arials   arial Slant=0.25 Pid=1 Eid=0 Encoding=T1.enc

       See ttf2tfm(1) and afm2tfm(1) of the dvips package for a detailed description of encoding files.

       Here a table listing the various ttf2tfm parameters and the corresponding entries in a map file:

           -s                  Slant
           -e                  Extend
           -p                  Encoding
           -f                  Fontindex
           -P                  Pid
           -E                  Eid
           -n                  PS=Yes
           -N                  PS=Only
           -R                  Replacement
           -x                  Rotate=Yes
           -y                  Y-Offset

       Single  replacement glyph names given to ttf2tfm with `-r old-glyphname new-glyphname' are directly specified
       with `old-glyphname=new-glyphname'.  They will be ignored if in subfont mode or if no encoding file is given.

       One additional parameter in a map file is unique to ttf2pk: `Hinting', which can  take  the  values  `On'  or
       `Off'.  Some fonts (e.g. the CJK part of cyberbit.ttf) are rendered incorrectly if hinting is activated.  De‐
       fault is `On' (you can also use `Yes', `No', `1', and `0').

       For a description of subfonts (i.e., entries  of  the  form  `<namestem>@<sfd-filename>@')  please  refer  to
       ttf2tfm(1).

       The  format of a map file is simple.  Each line defines a font; first comes the TeX font name, then its True‐
       Type font file name, followed by the parameters in any  order.   Case  is  significant  (even  for  parameter
       names);  the  parameters are separated from its values by an equal sign, with whitespace possibly surrounding
       it.  ttf2pk reads in all map files line by line in the order given in the configuration file, continuing  un‐
       til  the  TeX  font  specified  on the command line is found, otherwise the programs exits with error code 2.
       Thus you can use any character invalid in a TeX font name to start a comment line.

       You can use `\' as the final character of a line to indicate that the input is continued on  the  next  line.
       The backslash and the following newline character will be removed.

       ttf2pk will abort if it can't find or read the TeX font metrics file of the given TeX font name.

RETURN VALUE
       If  the  call  was successful, 0 will be returned.  In case of error, the return value is 1.  Finally, if the
       font can't be found in the map files, 2 is returned.  This simplifies the inclusion of  ttf2pk  into  scripts
       like mktexpk for automatic font generation.
