NAME
       infocmp - compare or print out terminfo descriptions

SYNOPSIS
       infocmp [-1CDEFGIKLTUVcdegilnpqrtux]
             [-v n] [-s d| i| l| c] [-R subset]
             [-w width] [-A directory] [-B directory]
             [termname...]

DESCRIPTION
       infocmp  can  be  used  to  compare  a  binary terminfo entry with other terminfo entries, rewrite a terminfo
       description to take advantage of the use= terminfo field, or print out a terminfo description from the binary
       file (term) in a variety of formats.  In all cases, the boolean fields will be printed first, followed by the
       numeric fields, followed by the string fields.

   Default Options
       If no options are specified and zero or one termnames are specified, the -I option will be assumed.  If  more
       than one termname is specified, the -d option will be assumed.

   Comparison Options [-d] [-c] [-n]
       infocmp  compares the terminfo description of the first terminal termname with each of the descriptions given
       by the entries for the other terminal's termnames.  If a capability is defined for only one of the terminals,
       the  value  returned will depend on the type of the capability: F for boolean variables, -1 for integer vari‐
       ables, and NULL for string variables.

       The -d option produces a list of each capability that is different between two entries.  This option is  use‐
       ful  to  show the difference between two entries, created by different people, for the same or similar termi‐
       nals.

       The -c option produces a list of each capability that is common between two or  more  entries.   Capabilities
       that  are  not  set  are  ignored.  This option can be used as a quick check to see if the -u option is worth
       using.

       The -n option produces a list of each capability that is in none of the given entries.  If no  termnames  are
       given,  the  environment  variable  TERM will be used for both of the termnames.  This can be used as a quick
       check to see if anything was left out of a description.

   Source Listing Options [-I] [-L] [-C] [-r]
       The -I, -L, and -C options will produce a source listing for each terminal named.

                               -I   use the terminfo names
                               -L   use the long C variable name listed in <term.h>
                               -C   use the termcap names
                               -r   when using -C, put out all capabilities in termcap form
                               -K   modifies the -C option, improving BSD-compatibility.

       If no termnames are given, the environment variable TERM will be used for the terminal name.

       The source produced by the -C option may be used directly as a  termcap  entry,  but  not  all  parameterized
       strings  can  be  changed  to  the termcap format.  infocmp will attempt to convert most of the parameterized
       information, and anything not converted will be plainly marked in the output and commented out.  These should
       be edited by hand.

       For  best  results  when  converting  to  termcap  format, you should use both -C and -r.  Normally a termcap
       description is limited to 1023 bytes.  infocmp trims away less essential parts to make it fit.   If  you  are
       converting  to  one  of the (rare) termcap implementations which accept an unlimited size of termcap, you may
       want to add the -T option.  More often however, you must help the termcap  implementation,  and  trim  excess
       whitespace (use the -0 option for that).

       All  padding  information  for  strings  will be collected together and placed at the beginning of the string
       where termcap expects it.  Mandatory padding (padding information with a trailing '/') will become optional.

       All termcap variables no longer supported by terminfo, but which are derivable from other terminfo variables,
       will  be  output.   Not all terminfo capabilities will be translated; only those variables which were part of
       termcap will normally be output.  Specifying the -r option will take off this restriction, allowing all capa‐
       bilities to be output in termcap form.  Normally you would use both the -C and -r options.  The actual format
       used incorporates some improvements for escaped characters from terminfo format.  For a stricter BSD-compati‐
       ble translation, use the -K option rather than -C.

       Note  that  because padding is collected to the beginning of the capability, not all capabilities are output.
       Mandatory padding is not supported.  Because termcap strings are not as flexible, it is not  always  possible
       to  convert  a  terminfo string capability into an equivalent termcap format.  A subsequent conversion of the
       termcap file back into terminfo format will not necessarily reproduce the original terminfo source.

       Some common terminfo parameter sequences, their termcap equivalents, and some terminal types  which  commonly
       have such sequences, are:

                              terminfo                    termcap   Representative Terminals
                              ───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

                              %p1%d                       %d        hp, ANSI standard, vt100

                              %p1%?%'x'%>%t%p1%'y'%+%;    %>xy      concept
                              %p2 is printed before %p1   %r        hp

   Use= Option [-u]
       The  -u option produces a terminfo source description of the first terminal termname which is relative to the
       sum of the descriptions given by the entries for the other terminals termnames.  It does  this  by  analyzing
       the  differences  between  the  first  termname and the other termnames and producing a description with use=
       fields for the other terminals.  In this manner, it is possible to retrofit generic terminfo entries  into  a
       terminal's  description.  Or, if two similar terminals exist, but were coded at different times or by differ‐
       ent people so that each description is a full description, using infocmp will show what can be done to change
       one description to be relative to the other.

       A  capability  will  get printed with an at-sign (@) if it no longer exists in the first termname, but one of
       the other termname entries contains a value for it.  A capability's value gets printed if the  value  in  the
       first  termname  is  not  found  in  any of the other termname entries, or if the first of the other termname
       entries that has this capability gives a different value for the capability than that in the first termname.

       The order of the other termname entries is significant.  Since the terminfo compiler tic does a left-to-right
       scan  of  the capabilities, specifying two use= entries that contain differing entries for the same capabili‐
       ties will produce different results depending on the order that the entries are given in.  infocmp will  flag
       any such inconsistencies between the other termname entries as they are found.

       Alternatively, specifying a capability after a use= entry that contains that capability will cause the second
       specification to be ignored.  Using infocmp to recreate a description can be a useful check to make sure that
       everything was specified correctly in the original source description.

       Another error that does not cause incorrect compiled files, but will slow down the compilation time, is spec‐
       ifying extra use= fields that are superfluous.  infocmp will flag any other termname use=  fields  that  were
       not needed.

   Changing Databases [-A directory] [-B directory]
       Like other ncurses utilities, infocmp looks for the terminal descriptions in several places.  You can use the
       TERMINFO and TERMINFO_DIRS environment variables to override the compiled-in default list of places to search
       (see curses(3X) for details).

       You  can  also  use  the  options  -A and -B to override the list of places to search when comparing terminal
       descriptions:

       ·   The -A option sets the location for the first termname

       ·   The -B option sets the location for the other termnames.

       Using these options, it is possible to compare descriptions for a terminal with the same name located in  two
       different databases.  For instance, you can use this feature for comparing descriptions for the same terminal
       created by different people.

   Other Options
       -0   causes the fields to be printed on one line, without wrapping.

       -1   causes the fields to be printed out one to a line.  Otherwise, the fields will be printed several  to  a
            line to a maximum width of 60 characters.

       -a   tells  infocmp  to retain commented-out capabilities rather than discarding them.  Capabilities are com‐
            mented by prefixing them with a period.

       -D   tells infocmp to print the database locations that it knows about, and exit.

       -E   Dump the capabilities of the given terminal as tables, needed in the C initializer for a TERMTYPE struc‐
            ture  (the terminal capability structure in the <term.h>).  This option is useful for preparing versions
            of the curses library hardwired for a given terminal type.  The tables are all declared static, and  are
            named according to the type and the name of the corresponding terminal entry.

            Before  ncurses  5.0,  the  split between the -e and -E options was not needed; but support for extended
            names required making the arrays of terminal capabilities separate from the TERMTYPE structure.

       -e   Dump the capabilities of the given terminal as a C initializer for a TERMTYPE  structure  (the  terminal
            capability  structure  in  the  <term.h>).   This  option is useful for preparing versions of the curses
            library hardwired for a given terminal type.

       -F   compare terminfo files.  This assumes that  two  following  arguments  are  filenames.   The  files  are
            searched  for  pairwise  matches  between  entries, with two entries considered to match if any of their
            names do.  The report printed to standard output lists entries with no matches in the  other  file,  and
            entries  with  more than one match.  For entries with exactly one match it includes a difference report.
            Normally, to reduce the volume of the report, use references are not resolved before looking for differ‐
            ences, but resolution can be forced by also specifying -r.

       -f   Display complex terminfo strings which contain if/then/else/endif expressions indented for readability.

       -G   Display constant literals in decimal form rather than their character equivalents.

       -g   Display constant character literals in quoted form rather than their decimal equivalents.

       -i   Analyze  the  initialization (is1, is2, is3), and reset (rs1, rs2, rs3), strings in the entry.  For each
            string, the code tries to analyze it into actions in terms of the other capabilities in the entry,  cer‐
            tain X3.64/ISO 6429/ECMA-48 capabilities, and certain DEC VT-series private modes (the set of recognized
            special sequences has been selected for completeness over the existing terminfo database).  Each  report
            line  consists  of the capability name, followed by a colon and space, followed by a printable expansion
            of the capability string with sections matching recognized actions translated into {}-bracketed descrip‐
            tions.  Here is a list of the DEC/ANSI special sequences recognized: i.

            It  also  recognizes  a  SGR action corresponding to ANSI/ISO 6429/ECMA Set Graphics Rendition, with the
            values NORMAL, BOLD, UNDERLINE, BLINK, and REVERSE.  All but NORMAL may be prefixed with `+'  (turn  on)
            or `-' (turn off).

       An SGR0 designates an empty highlight sequence (equivalent to {SGR:NORMAL}).

       -l   Set output format to terminfo.

       -p   Ignore padding specifications when comparing strings.

       -q   Make  the comparison listing shorter by omitting subheadings, and using "-" for absent capabilities, "@"
            for canceled rather than "NULL".

       -Rsubset
            Restrict output to a given subset.  This option is for use with archaic versions of terminfo like  those
            on  SVr1,  Ultrix,  or  HP/UX that do not support the full set of SVR4/XSI Curses terminfo; and variants
            such as AIX that have their own extensions incompatible with SVr4/XSI.  Available terminfo  subsets  are
            "SVr1",  "Ultrix",  "HP",  and "AIX"; see terminfo(5) for details.  You can also choose the subset "BSD"
            which selects only capabilities with termcap equivalents recognized by 4.4BSD.

       -s [d|i|l|c]
            The -s option sorts the fields within each type according to the argument below:

            d    leave fields in the order that they are stored in the terminfo database.

            i    sort by terminfo name.

            l    sort by the long C variable name.

            c    sort by the termcap name.

            If the -s option is not given, the fields printed out will be sorted alphabetically by the terminfo name
            within  each type, except in the case of the -C or the -L options, which cause the sorting to be done by
            the termcap name or the long C variable name, respectively.

       -T   eliminates size-restrictions on the generated text.  This is mainly useful  for  testing  and  analysis,
            since the compiled descriptions are limited (e.g., 1023 for termcap, 4096 for terminfo).

       -t   tells  tic  to  discard commented-out capabilities.  Normally when translating from terminfo to termcap,
            untranslatable capabilities are commented-out.

       -U   tells infocmp to not post-process the data after parsing the source file.  This feature helps when  com‐
            paring  the  actual contents of two source files, since it excludes the inferences that infocmp makes to
            fill in missing data.

       -V   reports the version of ncurses which was used in this program, and exits.

       -v n prints out tracing information on standard error as the program runs.  Higher values of n induce greater
            verbosity.

       -w width
            changes the output to width characters.

       -x   print  information for user-defined capabilities.  These are extensions to the terminfo repertoire which
            can be loaded using the -x option of tic.

FILES
       /etc/terminfo       Compiled terminal description database.

EXTENSIONS
       The -0, -1, -E, -F, -G, -R, -T, -V, -a, -e, -f, -g, -i, -l, -p, -q and -t options are not supported  in  SVr4
       curses.

       The  -r  option's  notion of `termcap' capabilities is System V Release 4's.  Actual BSD curses versions will
       have a more restricted set.  To see only the 4.4BSD set, use -r -RBSD.

BUGS
       The -F option of infocmp(1) should be a toe(1) mode.
