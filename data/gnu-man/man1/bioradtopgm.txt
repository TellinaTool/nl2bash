SYNOPSIS
       bioradtopgm [-image#] [imagedata]

DESCRIPTION
       Reads  a  Biorad  confocal  file as input.  Produces a portable graymap as output.  If the resulting image is
       upside down, run it through pnmflip -tb .

OPTIONS
       -image#
              A Biorad image file may contain more than one image. With this flag, you can specify  which  image  to
              extract  (only one at a time). The first image in the file has number zero. If no image number is sup‐
