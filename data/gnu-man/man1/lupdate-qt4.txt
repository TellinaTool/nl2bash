NAME
       lupdate - update Qt Linguist translation files

SYNOPSIS
       lupdate [ options ] project-file
       lupdate [ options ] source-files -ts ts-files

DESCRIPTION
       This  page documents the Qt Linguist Update tool for the Qt GUI toolkit.  Lupdate reads a qmake/tmake project
       file (.pro file), finds the translatable strings in the specified source, header  and  interface  files,  and
       updates  the translation files (.ts files) specified in it. The translation files are given to the translator
       who uses Qt Linguist to read the files and insert the translations.

       The .ts file format is a simple human-readable XML format that can be used with version  control  systems  if
       required.

OPTIONS
       -disable-heuristic {sametext|similartext|number}
              Disable the named merge heuristic. Can be specified multiple times.

       -extensions <ext>[,<ext>...]
              Process  files  with the given extensions only.  The extension list must be separated with commas, not
              with whitespace.  Default: 'ui,c,c++,cc,cpp,cxx,ch,h,h++,hh,hpp,hxx'.

       -help  Display the usage and exit.

       -locations {absolute|relative|none}
              Specify/override how source code references are saved in ts files.  Default is absolute.

       -no-obsolete
              Drop all obsolete strings.

       -no-recursive
              Do not recursively scan the following directories.

       -no-sort
              Do not sort contexts in .ts files.

       -pluralonly
              Only include plural form messages.

       -pro <filename>
              Name of a .pro file. Useful for files with .pro file syntax but different file suffix

       -recursive
              Recursively scan the following directories.

       -silent
              Don't explain what is being done.

       -source-language <language>[_<region>]
              Specify/override the language of the source strings. Defaults to POSIX if not specified and  the  file
              does not name it yet.

       -target-language <language>[_<region>]
              Specify/override  the  language of the translation.  The target language is guessed from the file name
              if this option is not specified and the file contents name no language yet.  -version Display the ver‐
              sion of lupdate and exit.

USAGE
       Here is an example .pro file that can be given to lupdate:

           HEADERS         = funnydialog.h \
                             wackywidget.h
           SOURCES         = funnydialog.cpp \
                             main.cpp \
                             wackywidget.cpp
           FORMS           = fancybox.ui
           TRANSLATIONS    = gnomovision_dk.ts \
                             gnomovision_fi.ts \
                             gnomovision_no.ts \
                             gnomovision_se.ts

       When  running  lupdate on this project file, the translatable strings in all the files listed in the HEADERS,
       SOURCES and FORMS entries will be put in the translation files listed in  the  TRANSLATIONS  entry.  Previous
       translations  will  be  reused  as far as possible, and translated strings that have vanished from the source
       files are marked obsolete.

       lupdate can also be invoked with a list of C++ source files, .ui files and .ts files:

           lupdate *.cpp *.h *.ui -ts gnomovision_dk.ts
