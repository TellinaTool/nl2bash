NEQN(1)                                        General Commands Manual                                       NEQN(1)



NAME
       neqn - format equations for ascii output

SYNOPSIS
       neqn [eqn options]

DESCRIPTION
       The  neqn  program  is  actually  just  a shell script which invokes the eqn(1) command with the ascii output
       device.

       Note that eqn does not support low-resolution, typewriter-like devices (although it may work  adequately  for
       very simple input).

SEE ALSO
       eqn(1)
