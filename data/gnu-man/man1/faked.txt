NAME
       faked - daemon that remembers fake ownership/permissions of files manipulated by fakeroot processes.

SYNOPSIS
       faked [--debug] [--foreground] [--cleanup] [--key msg-key] [--load] [--save-file save-file] [--port TCP-port]

DESCRIPTION
       If  a fakeroot process wants to change the ownership of a file, then faked is the process that remembers that
       new owner. If later the same fakeroot process does a stat() for that filename, then the  libfakeroot  wrapped
       stat() call will first ask faked for the fake ownership etc of that file, and then report it.


OPTIONS
       --debug
              Print debugging information on stderr.

       --foreground
              Don't fork into the background.

       --cleanup  number
              Cleanup the semaphores.

       --key  key-number
              Don't  allocate a new communication channel, but use channel specified by key. (If the specified chan‐
              nel doesn't exist, it's created).

       --save-file  save-file
              Save the environment to save-file on exit.

       --load Load a previously saved environment from the standard input.

       --unknown-is-real
              Use real ownership of previously-unknown files instead of setting them to root:root.

       --port  tcp-port
              Use TCP port tcp-port.


BUGS
       None so far. Be warned, though: although I've written quite a few much larger (and  smaller)  programs,  I've
       never  written  anything  that was as tiny as fakeroot, had as many bugs as fakeroot, and still was as usable
       as, say, fakeroot version 0.0_3, the first version that could be used to build itself.
