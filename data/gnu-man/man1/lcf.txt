LCF(1)                                         Debian GNU/Linux manual                                        LCF(1)



NAME
       lcf - Determine which of the historical versions of a config is installed

SYNOPSIS
       lcf [options] <Destination File Name> <Historical MD5SUM source directory>

DESCRIPTION
       This  script, given a destination file name, and a directory containing md5sums of historical versions of the
       file, attempts to determine if the installed version corresponds to a historical version. lcf uses  the  same
       algorithm that ucf uses, and should exhibit the same behaviour.

       The source directory is the place where historical md5sums are expected to live. Specifically, the historical
       md5sums are looked for in either the file ${filename}.md5sum, or the subdirectory ${filename}.md5sum.d/

OPTIONS
       -h, --help
              Print a short usage message

       -n, --no-action
              Dry run. Print the actions that would be taken if the script is invoked, but take no action.

       -d [n], --debug [n]
              Set the debug level to the (optional) level n (n defaults to  1).  This  turns  on  copious  debugging
              information.

       -v,  --verbose
              Make the script be very verbose about setting internal variables.

FILES
       /var/lib/ucf/hashfile, /etc/ucf.conf

SEE ALSO
       ucf(1) ucf.conf(5).

BUGS
       There are no bugs.  Any resemblance thereof is delirium. Really.
