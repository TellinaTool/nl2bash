NAME
       pnmflip - perform one or more flip operations on a portable anymap

SYNOPSIS
       pnmflip  [-leftright|-lr]  [-topbottom|-tb]  [-transpose|-xy]  [-rotate90|-r90|-ccw ] [-rotate270|-r270|-cw ]
       [-rotate180|-r180] [pnmfile]

DESCRIPTION
       Reads a portable anymap as input.  Performs one or more flip operations, in the order specified,  and  writes
       out a portable anymap.

OPTIONS
       The  flip  operations  available are: left for right (-leftright or -lr); top for bottom (-topbottom or -tb);
       and transposition (-transpose or -xy).  In addition, some canned concatenations are available:  -rotate90  or
       -ccw  is  equivalent  to -transpose -topbottom; -rotate270 or -cw is equivalent to -transpose -leftright; and
       -rotate180 is equivalent to -leftright -topbottom.

       All flags can be abbreviated to their shortest unique prefix.
