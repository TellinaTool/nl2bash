NAME
       ipcs - provide information on ipc facilities

SYNOPSIS
       ipcs [-asmq] [-tclup]
       ipcs [-smq] -i id
       ipcs -h

DESCRIPTION
       ipcs provides information on the ipc facilities for which the calling process has read access.

       The -i option allows a specific resource id to be specified.  Only information on this id will be printed.

       Resources may be specified as follows:

       -m     shared memory segments

       -q     message queues

       -s     semaphore arrays

       -a     all (this is the default)

       The output format may be specified as follows:

       -t     time

       -p     pid

       -c     creator

       -l     limits

       -u     summary

CONFORMING TO
       The Linux ipcs utility is not fully compatible to the POSIX ipcs utility.  The Linux version does not support
       the -b and -o options, but does support the -l and -u options not defined by POSIX. The portable  application
       shall not use the -a, -b, -o, -l, and -u options.
