NAME
       ngettext - translate message and choose plural form

SYNOPSIS
       ngettext [OPTION] [TEXTDOMAIN] MSGID MSGID-PLURAL COUNT

DESCRIPTION
       The ngettext program translates a natural language message into the user's language, by looking up the trans‐
       lation in a message catalog, and chooses the appropriate plural form, which depends on the number  COUNT  and
       the language of the message catalog where the translation was found.

       Display native language translation of a textual message whose grammatical form depends on a number.

       -d, --domain=TEXTDOMAIN
              retrieve translated message from TEXTDOMAIN

       -e     enable expansion of some escape sequences

       -E     (ignored for compatibility)

       -h, --help
              display this help and exit

       -V, --version
              display version information and exit

       [TEXTDOMAIN]
              retrieve translated message from TEXTDOMAIN

       MSGID MSGID-PLURAL
              translate MSGID (singular) / MSGID-PLURAL (plural)

       COUNT  choose singular/plural form based on this value

       If  the TEXTDOMAIN parameter is not given, the domain is determined from the environment variable TEXTDOMAIN.
       If the message catalog is not found in the regular directory, another location  can  be  specified  with  the
       environment variable TEXTDOMAINDIR.  Standard search directory: /usr/share/locale
