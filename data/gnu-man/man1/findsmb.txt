NAME
       findsmb - list info about machines that respond to SMB name queries on a subnet

SYNOPSIS
       findsmb [subnet broadcast address]

DESCRIPTION
       This perl script is part of the samba(7) suite.

       findsmb is a perl script that prints out several pieces of information about machines on a subnet that
       respond to SMB name query requests. It uses nmblookup(1) and smbclient(1) to obtain this information.

OPTIONS
       -r
           Controls whether findsmb takes bugs in Windows95 into account when trying to find a Netbios name
           registered of the remote machine. This option is disabled by default because it is specific to Windows 95
           and Windows 95 machines only. If set, nmblookup(1) will be called with -B option.

       subnet broadcast address
           Without this option, findsmb will probe the subnet of the machine where findsmb(1) is run. This value is
           passed to nmblookup(1) as part of the -B option.

EXAMPLES
       The output of findsmb lists the following information for all machines that respond to the initial nmblookup
       for any name: IP address, NetBIOS name, Workgroup name, operating system, and SMB server version.

       There will be a '+' in front of the workgroup name for machines that are local master browsers for that
       workgroup. There will be an '*' in front of the workgroup name for machines that are the domain master
       browser for that workgroup. Machines that are running Windows for Workgroups, Windows 95 or Windows 98 will
       not show any information about the operating system or server version.

       The command with -r option must be run on a system without nmbd(8) running. If nmbd is running on the system,
       you will only get the IP address and the DNS name of the machine. To get proper responses from Windows 95 and
       Windows 98 machines, the command must be run as root and with -r option on a machine without nmbd running.

       For example, running findsmb without -r option set would yield output similar to the following

           IP ADDR         NETBIOS NAME   WORKGROUP/OS/VERSION

AUTHOR
       The original Samba software and related utilities were created by Andrew Tridgell. Samba is now developed by
       the Samba Team as an Open Source project similar to the way the Linux kernel is developed.

       The original Samba man pages were written by Karl Auer. The man page sources were converted to YODL format
       (another excellent piece of Open Source software, available at ftp://ftp.icce.rug.nl/pub/unix/) and updated
       for the Samba 2.0 release by Jeremy Allison. The conversion to DocBook for Samba 2.2 was done by Gerald
       Carter. The conversion to DocBook XML 4.2 for Samba 3.0 was done by Alexander Bokovoy.
