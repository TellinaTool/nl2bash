NAME
       dumpiso - dump IEEE 1394 isochronous channel packets

SYNOPSIS
       dumpiso [ options ] [ FILE ]

DESCRIPTION
       dumpiso  listens on a selected range of channels and dumps all received packets into the file FILE or, if not
       given, to standard output.  While dumping, the current number of received  packets  is  written  to  standard
       error and updated with every packet.

       It  uses a simple file format for the dumps which is described in isodump(5).  The dumped packets can be sent
       out again with sendiso(1).

OPTIONS
       -c, --channels=CHANNELS
              Sets the channels to listen on.  CHANNELS can be either a single number, in which  case  this  is  the
              only  channel  to listen on, or a range of channels in the form X-Y.  Channel numbers can range from 0
              to 63.  You can give this option multiple times, new channels are added to the  list  of  already  set
              channels.  Defaults to all channels.

       -p, --port=PORT
              Choose  port  PORT  for  receiving.   A  port is a 1394 card or chip and represents one connected bus,
              therefore this is only relevant when you have multiple of these.  Defaults to 0.

       -h, --help
              Show help text and exit.

BUGS
       None known.
