TABS(1)                   BSD General Commands Manual                  TABS(1)

NAME
     tabs -- set terminal tabs

SYNOPSIS
     tabs [-n | -a | -a2 | -c | -c2 | -c3 | -f | -p | -s | -u] [+m[n]]
          [-T type]
     tabs [-T type] [+[n]] n1[,n2,...]

DESCRIPTION
     The tabs utility displays a series of characters that clear the hardware
     terminal tab settings then initialises tab stops at specified positions,
     and optionally adjusts the margin.

     In the first synopsis form, the tab stops set depend on the command line
     options used, and may be one of the predefined formats or at regular
     intervals.

     In the second synopsis form, tab stops are set at positions n1, n2, etc.
     If a position is preceded by a `+', it is relative to the previous posi-
     tion set.  No more than 20 positions may be specified.

     If no tab stops are specified, the ``standard'' UNIX tab width of 8 is
     used.

     The options are as follows:

     -n      Set a tab stop every n columns.  If n is 0, the tab stops are
             cleared but no new ones are set.

     -a      Assembler format (columns 1, 10, 16, 36, 72).

     -a2     Assembler format (columns 1, 10, 16, 40, 72).

     -c      COBOL normal format (columns 1, 8, 12, 16, 20, 55)

     -c2     COBOL compact format (columns 1, 6, 10, 14, 49)

     -c3     COBOL compact format (columns 1, 6, 10, 14, 18, 22, 26, 30, 34,
             38, 42, 46, 50, 54, 58, 62, 67).

     -f      FORTRAN format (columns 1, 7, 11, 15, 19, 23).

     -p      PL/1 format (columns 1, 5, 9, 13, 17, 21, 25, 29, 33, 37, 41, 45,
             49, 53, 57, 61).

     -s      SNOBOL format (columns 1, 10, 55).

     -u      Assembler format (columns 1, 12, 20, 44).

     +m[n], +[n]
             Set an n character left margin, or 10 if n is omitted.

     -T type
             Output escape sequence for the terminal type type.

ENVIRONMENT
     The LANG, LC_ALL, LC_CTYPE and TERM environment variables affect the exe-
     cution of tabs as described in environ(7).

     The -T option overrides the setting of the TERM environment variable.  If
     neither TERM nor the -T option are present, tabs will fail.

EXIT STATUS
     The tabs utility exits 0 on success, and >0 if an error occurs.

SEE ALSO
     expand(1), stty(1), tput(1), unexpand(1), termcap(5)

STANDARDS
     The tabs utility conforms to IEEE Std 1003.1-2001 (``POSIX.1'').

HISTORY
     A tabs utility appeared in PWB UNIX.  This implementation was introduced
     in FreeBSD 5.0.

BUGS
     The current termcap(5) database does not define the `ML' (set left soft
     margin) capability for any terminals.
