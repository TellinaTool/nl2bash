SNMPTEST(1)                        Net-SNMP                        SNMPTEST(1)



NAME
       snmptest - communicates with a network entity using SNMP requests

SYNOPSIS
       snmptest [COMMON OPTIONS] AGENT

DESCRIPTION
       snmptest  is  a  flexible  SNMP application that can monitor and manage
       information on a network entity.

       After invoking the program, a  command  line  interpreter  proceeds  to
       accept  commands.   This  intepreter enables the user to send different
       types of SNMP requests to target agents.

       AGENT identifies a target SNMP agent, which is instrumented to  monitor
       the  given objects.  At its simplest, the AGENT specification will con-
       sist of a hostname or an IPv4 address.  In this situation, the  command
       will  attempt  communication with the agent, using UDP/IPv4 to port 161
       of the given target host. See snmpcmd(1) for a full list of the  possi-
       ble formats for AGENT.

       Once snmptest is invoked, the command line intepreter will prompt with:

       Variable:

       At this point you can enter one or more variable names, one  per  line.
       A  blank line ends the parameter input and will send the request (vari-
       ables entered) in a single packet, to the remote entity.  Each variable
       name is given in the format specified in variables(5).  For example:

       snmptest -c public -v 1 zeus
       Variable: system.sysDescr.0
       Variable:

       will  return  some  information about the request and reply packets, as
       well as the information:

       requestid 0x5992478A errstat 0x0 errindex 0x0
       system.sysDescr.0 = STRING: "Unix 4.3BSD"

       The errstatus value shows the error status code for the call.  The pos-
       sible  values  for errstat are in the header file snmp.h.  The errindex
       value identifies the variable that has the given error.   Index  values
       are  assigned  to  all the variables entered at the "Variable": prompt.
       The first value is assigned an index of 1.

       Upon startup, the program defaults to sending  a  GET  request  packet.
       The  type of request can be changed by typing one of the following com-
       mands at the "Variable:" prompt:

       $G - send a GET request
       $N - send a GETNEXT request
       $S - send a SET request
       $B - send a GETBULK request
            Note: GETBULK is not available in SNMPv1
       $I - send an Inform request
       $T - send an SNMPv2 Trap request

       Other values that can be entered at the "Variable:" prompt are:

       $D - toggle the dumping of each sent and received packet
       $QP - toggle a quicker, less verbose output form
       $Q - Quit the program

       Request Types:

       GET Request:

       When in "GET request" mode ($G or default), the user can enter  an  OID
       at  the  "Variable:"  prompt. The user can enter multiple OIDs, one per
       prompt. The user enters a blank line to send the GET request.

       GETNEXT Request:

       The "GETNEXT request" mode ($N) is simlar to the  "Get  request"  mode,
       described above.

       SET Request:

       When  in  the "SET request" mode ($S), more information is requested by
       the prompt for each variable.  The prompt:

       Type [i|s|x|d|n|o|t|a]:
       requests the type of the variable be entered.  Depending on the type of
       value you want to set, you can type one of the following:

       i - integer
       u - unsigned integer
       s - octet string in ASCII
       x - octet string in hex bytes, separated by whitespace
       d - octet string as decimal bytes, separated by whitespace
       a - ip address in dotted IP notation
       o - object identifier
       n - null
       t - timeticks
       At this point a value will be prompted for:

       Value:

       If this is an integer value, just type the integer (in decimal).  If it
       is a decimal string, type in white-space separated decimal numbers, one
       per  byte of the string.  Again type a blank line at the prompt for the
       variable name to send the packet.

       GETBULK Request:

       The "GETBULK request" mode ($B) is similar to the "Set  request"  mode.
       GETBULK, however, is not available in SNMPv1.

       Inform Request:

       The  "Inform  request"  mode ($I) is similar to the "Set request" mode.
       This type of request, however, is not available in  SNMPv1.  Also,  the
       _agent_ specified on the snmptest command should correspond to the tar-
       get snmptrapd agent.

       SNMPv2 Trap Request:

       The "SNMPv2 Trap Request" mode ($T) is similar  to  the  "Set  request"
       mode.  This type of request, however, is not available in SNMPv1. Also,
       the _agent_ specified on the snmptest command should correspond to  the
       target snmptrapd agent.

OPTIONS
       snmptest  takes  the  common options described in the snmpcmd(1) manual
       page.
