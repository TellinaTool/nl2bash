SNMPGETNEXT(1)                     Net-SNMP                     SNMPGETNEXT(1)



NAME
       snmpgetnext  -  communicates  with  a network entity using SNMP GETNEXT
       requests

SYNOPSIS
       snmpgetnext [COMMON OPTIONS] [-Cf] AGENT OID [OID]...

DESCRIPTION
       snmpget is an SNMP application that uses the SNMP  GETNEXT  request  to
       query  for information on a network entity.  One or more object identi-
       fiers (OIDs) may be given as arguments on the command line.  Each vari-
       able  name  is given in the format specified in variables(5).  For each
       one, the variable  that  is  lexicographically  "next"  in  the  remote
       entity's MIB will be returned.

       For example:

       snmpgetnext -c public zeus interfaces.ifTable.ifEntry.ifType.1

       will retrieve the variable interfaces.ifTable.ifEntry.ifType.2:

       interfaces.ifTable.ifEntry.ifType.2 = softwareLoopback(24)

       If  the  network  entity has an error processing the request packet, an
       error message will be shown,  helping  to  pinpoint  in  what  way  the
       request was malformed.

OPTIONS
       -Cf     If -Cf is not specified, some applications (snmpdelta, snmpget,
               snmpgetnext and snmpstatus) will try to fix errors returned  by
               the agent that you were talking to and resend the request.  The
               only time this is really useful is if you specified a OID  that
               didn't  exist  in  your  request  and you're using SNMPv1 which
               requires "all or nothing" kinds of requests.

       In addition to  this  option,  snmpgetnext  takes  the  common  options
       described  in  the  snmpcmd(1)  manual  page.   Note  that  snmpgetnext
       REQUIRES an argument specifying the agent to query and at least one OID
       argument, as described there.
