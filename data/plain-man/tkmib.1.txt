NAME
       tkmib - an interactive graphical MIB browser for SNMP

SYNOPSIS
       tkmib

DESCRIPTION
       Simple  Network  Management  Protocol  (SNMP)  provides a framework for
       exchange of the management information between the agents (servers) and
       clients.  The  Management  Information  Bases  (MIBs)  contain a formal
       description of a set of network objects that can be managed  using  the
       SNMP  for  a  particular agent. tkmib is a graphical user interface for
       browsing the MIBs. It is also capable of sending or retrieving the SNMP
       management information to/from the remote agents interactively.
