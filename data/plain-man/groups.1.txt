NAME
     groups -- show group memberships

SYNOPSIS
     groups [user]

DESCRIPTION
     The groups utility has been obsoleted by the id(1) utility, and is equiv-
     alent to ``id -Gn [user]''.  The command ``id -p'' is suggested for nor-
     mal interactive use.

     The groups utility displays the groups to which you (or the optionally
     specified user) belong.

EXIT STATUS
     The groups utility exits 0 on success, and >0 if an error occurs.
