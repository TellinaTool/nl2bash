NAME
     memory_pressure -- Tool to apply real or simulate memory pressure on the
     system.

SYNOPSIS
     memory_pressure [-l level] | [-p percent_free] | [-S -l level]

OPTIONS
     -l <level> Apply real or simulate memory pressure (if specified alongside
     simulate argument) on the system till low memory notifications corre-
     sponding to <level> are generated. Supported values are "warn" and "crit-
     ical".

     -p <percent_free> Allocate memory till the available memory in the system
     is <percent_free> of total memory. If the percentage of available memory
     to total memory on the system drops, the tool will free memory till
     either the desired percentage is achieved or it runs out of memory to
     free.

     -S Simulate memory pressure on the system by placing it artificially for
     <sleep_seconds> duration at the "warn" or "critical" level.

     -s <sleep_seconds> Duration to wait before allocating or freeing memory
     if applying real pressure. In case of simulating memory pressure, this is
     the duration the system will be maintained at an artifical memory level.

DESCRIPTION
     A tool to apply real or simulate memory pressure on the system
