NAME
       phar, phar.phar - PHAR (PHP archive) command line tool

SYNOPSIS
       phar <command> [options] ...


DESCRIPTION
       The PHAR file format provides a way to put entire PHP applications into
       a single file called a "phar" (PHP Archive) for easy  distribution  and
       installation.

       With the phar command you can create, update or extract PHP archives.

       Commands: add compress delete extract help help-list info list meta-del
       meta-get meta-set pack sign stub-get stub-set tree version


add command
       Add entries to a PHAR package.

       Required arguments:

       -f file        Specifies the phar file to work on.

       ...            Any number of input files and directories. If -i  is  in
                      use  then  ONLY  files  and  matching  the given regular
                      expression are being packed. If -x is given  then  files
                      matching that regular expression are NOT being packed.

       Optional arguments:

       -a alias       Provide an alias name for the phar file.

       -c algo        Compression algorithm (see COMPRESSION )

       -i regex       Specifies a regular expression for input files.

       -l level       Number  of  preceding  subdirectories to strip from file
                      entries

                      directory name if any).


delete command
       Delete entry from a PHAR archive

       Required arguments:

       Optional arguments:

       ...            Optional command to retrieve help for.


help-list command
       Lists available commands.


info command
       Get information about a PHAR package.

       By using -k it is possible to return a single value.

       Required arguments:

       -f file        Specifies the phar file to work on.

       Optional arguments:

       -k index       Subscription index to work on.


list command
       List contents of a PHAR archive.

       Required arguments:

       -f file        Specifies the phar file to work on.

       Optional arguments:

       -i regex       Specifies a regular expression for input files.

       -x regex       Regular expression for input files to exclude.



meta-del command
       Delete meta information of a PHAR entry or a PHAR package.

       If -k is given then the metadata is expected to be  an  array  and  the
       given index is being deleted.

       If something was deleted the return value is 0 otherwise it is 1.

       Required arguments:

       -f file        Specifies the phar file to work on.

       Optional arguments:

       -e entry       Name  of  entry  to  work on (must include PHAR internal
                      directory name if any).

       -k index       Subscription index to work on.


meta-get command
       Get meta information of a PHAR entry or a PHAR  package  in  serialized
       from. If no output file is specified for meta data then stdout is being
       used.  You can also specify a particular index using -k. In  that  case
       the  metadata  is  expected  to  be an array and the value of the given
       index is returned using echo rather than using serialize. If that index
       does not exist or no meta data is present then the return value is 1.

       Required arguments:

       -f file        Specifies the phar file to work on.

       Optional arguments:

       -e entry       Name  of  entry  to  work on (must include PHAR internal
                      directory name if any).

       -k index       Subscription index to work on.


meta-set command
       Set meta data of a PHAR entry or a PHAR package using serialized input.
       If  no  input file is specified for meta data then stdin is being used.
       You can also specify a particular index using  -k.  In  that  case  the
       metadata is expected to be an array and the value of the given index is
       being set.  If the metadata is not present or empty a new array will be
       created.   If  the metadata is present and a flat value then the return
       value is 1. Also using -k the input is been taken directly rather  then
       being serialized.

       Required arguments:

       -f file        Specifies the phar file to work on.

       -m meta        Meta data to store with entry (serialized php data).

       Optional arguments:

       -e entry       Name  of  entry  to  work on (must include PHAR internal
                      directory name if any).

       -k index       Subscription index to work on.


pack command
       Pack files into a PHAR archive.

       When using -s <stub>, then the stub file is  being  excluded  from  the
       list  of input files/dirs.To create an archive that contains PEAR class
       PHP_Archive then point -p argument to PHP/Archive.php.

       Required arguments:

       -f file        Specifies the phar file to work on.

       ...            Any number of input files and directories. If -i  is  in
                      use  then  ONLY  files  and  matching  the given regular
                      expression are being packed. If -x is given  then  files
                      matching that regular expression are NOT being packed.

       Optional arguments:

       -a alias       Provide an alias name for the phar file.

       -b bang        Hash-bang    line    to    start   the   archive   (e.g.
                      #!/usr/bin/php).  The hash mark itself '#!' and the new-
                      line character are optional.

       -c algo        Compression algorithm (see COMPRESSION )

       -h hash        Selects the hash algorithm (see HASH )

       -i regex       Specifies a regular expression for input files.

       -l level       Number  of  preceding  subdirectories to strip from file
                      entries

       -p loader      Location of  PHP_Archive  class  file  (pear  list-files
                      PHP_Archive).You  can  use '0' or '1' to locate it auto-
                      matically using the mentioned pear command.  When  using
                      '0'  the  command does not error out when the class file
                      cannot be located.  This  switch  also  adds  some  code
                      around  the  stub  so that class PHP_Archive gets regis-
                      tered  as  phar://  stream  wrapper  if  necessary.  And
                      finally this switch will add the file phar.inc from this
                      package and load it to ensure class Phar is present.

       -s stub        Select the stub file.

       -x regex       Regular expression for input files to exclude.

       -y key         Private key for OpenSSL signing.

       Set signature hash algorithm.

       Required arguments:

       -f file        Specifies the phar file to work on.

       Optional arguments:

       -y key         Private key for OpenSSL signing.


stub-get command
       Get the stub of a PHAR file. If no output file  is  specified  as  stub
       then stdout is being used.

       Required arguments:

       -f file        Specifies the phar file to work on.

       Optional arguments:

       -s stub        Select the stub file.


stub-set command
       Set the stub of a PHAR file. If no input file is specified as stub then
       stdin is being used.

       Required arguments:

       -f file        Specifies the phar file to work on.

       Optional arguments:

       -b bang        Hash-bang   line   to   start    the    archive    (e.g.
                      #!/usr/bin/php).  The hash mark itself '#!' and the new-
                      line character are optional.

       -p loader      Location of  PHP_Archive  class  file  (pear  list-files

                      matically using the mentioned pear command.  When  using
                      '0'  the  command does not error out when the class file
                      cannot be located.  This  switch  also  adds  some  code
                      around  the  stub  so that class PHP_Archive gets regis-
                      tered  as  phar://  stream  wrapper  if  necessary.  And
                      finally this switch will add the file phar.inc from this
