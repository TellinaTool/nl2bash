NAME
       perlmacosx - Perl under Mac OS X

SYNOPSIS
       This document briefly describes Perl under Mac OS X.

         curl http://www.cpan.org/src/perl-5.16.3.tar.gz > perl-5.16.3.tar.gz
         tar -xzf perl-5.16.3.tar.gz
         cd perl-5.16.3
         ./Configure -des -Dprefix=/usr/local/
         make
         make test
         sudo make install

DESCRIPTION
       The latest Perl release (5.16.3 as of this writing) builds without
       changes under all versions of Mac OS X from 10.3 "Panther" onwards.

       In order to build your own version of Perl you will need 'make' this is
       part of the Apples developer tools (you only need the 'unix tools'),
       usually supplied with Mac OS install DVDs. You do not need the latest
       version of Xcode (which is now charged for) in order to install make.

       Earlier Mac OS X releases (10.2 "Jaguar" and older) did not include a
       completely thread-safe libc, so threading is not fully supported. Also,
       earlier releases included a buggy libdb, so some of the DB_File tests
       are known to fail on those releases.

Customizations in Apple's Perl
       Several custom features have been added to the version of perl in Mac
       OS X.

   Module Search Path (@INC)
       Since 10.4 "Tiger", system administrators can easily add paths to
       perl's module search path.  The file
       '/Library/Perl/${version}/PrependToPath' contains paths (one per line)
       that will be added to the beginning of the search path, while the file
       '/Library/Perl/${version}/AppendToPath' contains paths that will be
       added to the end of the search path.

       By default, Mac OS X does not come with a PrependToPath file, but does
       come with an AppendToPath file.  This file contains the path
       '/System/Library/Perl/Extras/${version}', where third-party perl
       modules that Apple ships on Mac OS X, are installed.  In addition, it
       contains the paths to previous versions of '/Library/Perl/${version}'
       (where ${version} are the previous versions of perl that shipped in Mac
       OS X), to maintain backwards compatibility.

       In 10.5 "Leopard" and beyond, the environment variable
       NO_PERL_PREPENDTOPATH (set to anything) will cause perl to not load any
       PrependToPath file.  Likewise, the NO_PERL_APPENDTOPATH environment
       variable will case perl to not load any AppendToPath file.

       In 10.5.7 for versions of perl before 5.16.3, there is a new path,
       '/Library/Perl/Updates/${version}' that comes before the system perl
       directory.  When 'INSTALLDIRS=perl' is specified to Makefile.PL,
       modules that previous overwrite those in
       '/System/Library/Perl/${version}', will now be install in
       '/Library/Perl/Updates/${version}'.  This allows Apple to update
       modules in the system perl, but users will get the versions they
       installed in '/Library/Perl/Updates/${version}'.

       In addition, the Config parameters "installprivlib" and
       "installarchlib" now corresponds to this new directory.  There are also
       the new parameters "installupdateslib", "installupdatesarch",
       "updateslib" and "updatesarch", which also correspond to this new
       directory, and are provided for completeness.

       However, for perl 5.16.3 in Mac OS X 10.7, the order of the include
       paths was changed so that '/Library/Perl/5.16.3' came before
       '/System/Library/Perl/5.16.3', so '/Library/Perl/Updates' is no longer
       needed.  The Config parameters "installprivlib" and "installarchlib"
       have returned to their original values, and "installupdateslib",
       "installupdatesarch", "updateslib" and "updatesarch" have been removed.

   Dtrace Support
       Dtrace support has been added to perl to allow tracing of perl
       subroutine calls, both entry and return.  Here is a quick example:

           % cat test.pl
           #!/usr/bin/perl

           sub a {
               print "Ah! death. Welcome to thee brother\n";
           }

           sub b {
               print "Where art thou a()?\n";
               a();
           }

           sub c {
               print "The band of alphabets\n";
               b();
           }

           sub main {
               c();
           }

           main();
           % cat pltest.d
           perl$target:::
           {
               printf("%s\n", copyinstr(arg0));
           }
           % sudo dtrace -s pltest.d -c 'perl test.pl'
           dtrace: description 'perl$target::: ' matched 8 probes
           The band of alphabets
           Where art thou a()?
           Ah! death. Welcome to thee brother
           dtrace: pid 50272 has exited

   64-bit Support
       Since 10.5 "Leopard", Mac OS X provided both 32 and 64-bit support for
       libraries and frameworks, allowing both 32 and 64-bit applications to
       be written.  While running perl (and all other command-line programs)
       remained 32-bit, the 'libperl.dylib' library is 32/64 bits.  This
       allows programs with embedded perl support to run in both 32 and 64-bit
       mode as needed.

       To support this, changes to the Config module were made to return the
       correct values for the internal sizes of perl types.  For example,
       "longsize" return 4 in 32-bits, while it returns 8 in 64-bits.

       Related to this support is the new environment variable ARCHFLAGS,
       which provides a way to build extensions for different machine and
       32/64-bit architectures.  The default architecture to build extensions
       before 10.5 was the (single) architecture of the building machine.  In
       10.5, this became building both 32-bit PowerPC and Intel.  In 10.6 and
       beyond, the default architectures were changed to building 32-bit for
       both PowerPC and Intel, and 64-bit only for Intel.  With ARCHFLAGS,
       this can be changed to whatever architectures the user wants to build.
       For example:

           % env ARCHFLAGS='-arch i386 -arch x86_64' perl Makefile.PL
           % make
           % make install

       will build only 2-way universal.

   Multiple Version Support
       Since 10.6 "SnowLeopard", more than one version of perl are supported.
       So out of the box, the default version of perl is 5.16.  However, to
       provide backwards compatibility with previous versions of perl,
       especially for systems that have installed (version-specific) perl
       modules, or to provide newer versions of perl that we aren't ready to
       make the default, '/usr/bin/perl' can be switched to use an alternate
       version, on a per-user or system-wide basis.  The alternate version of
       perl that is provided is .

       Users can select the alternate version by simply running the following
       command:

           % defaults write com.apple.versioner.perl Version

       Subsequent invocations of '/usr/bin/perl' will then use the  version.

       In addition, both perl versions will ship as a universal binary
       containing 64-bit support, which will be on by default.  For those
       cases where 32-bit perl is desired, the following command can be used:

           % defaults write com.apple.versioner.perl Prefer-32-Bit -bool yes

       To set defaults systemwide, use the above commands, but replace the
       third argument with '/Library/Preferences/com.apple.versioner.perl'
       (admin privileges will be required).

       The environment variables VERSIONER_PERL_VERSION (set to one of the
       supported versions) and VERSIONER_PERL_PREFER_32_BIT (set to 'true',
       'false', 'yes', 'no', '1' or '0') can also be set, and they override
       the settings in any preference files.

       Note: this may changes in future versions of Mac OS X, which may use an
       improved scheme for making such settings.

Building Perl
   Installation Prefix
       The default installation location for this release uses the traditional
       UNIX directory layout under /usr/local. This is the recommended
       location for most users, and will leave the Apple-supplied Perl and its
       modules undisturbed.

       Using an installation prefix of '/usr' will result in a directory
       layout that mirrors that of Apple's default Perl, with core modules
       stored in '/System/Library/Perl/${version}', CPAN modules stored in
       '/Library/Perl/${version}', and the addition of
       '/Network/Library/Perl/${version}' to @INC for modules that are stored
       on a file server and used by many Macs.

   SDK support
       First, export the path to the SDK into the build environment:

           export SDK=/Developer/SDKs/MacOSX10.3.9.sdk

       Use an SDK by exporting some additions to Perl's 'ccflags' and
       '..flags' config variables:

           ./Configure -Accflags="-nostdinc -B$SDK/usr/include/gcc \
                                  -B$SDK/usr/lib/gcc -isystem$SDK/usr/include \
                                  -F$SDK/System/Library/Frameworks" \
                       -Aldflags="-Wl,-syslibroot,$SDK" \
                       -de

   Universal Binary support
       To compile perl as a universal binary (built for both ppc and intel),
       export the SDK variable as above, selecting the 10.4u SDK:

           export SDK=/Developer/SDKs/MacOSX10.4u.sdk

       In addition to the compiler flags used to select the SDK, also add the
       flags for creating a universal binary:

           ./Configure -Accflags="-arch i686 -arch ppc -nostdinc -B$SDK/usr/include/gcc \
                                  -B$SDK/usr/lib/gcc -isystem$SDK/usr/include \
                                  -F$SDK/System/Library/Frameworks" \
                       -Aldflags="-arch i686 -arch ppc -Wl,-syslibroot,$SDK" \
                       -de

       In Leopard (MacOSX 10.5.6 at the time of this writing) you must use the
       10.5 SDK:

           export SDK=/Developer/SDKs/MacOSX10.5.sdk

       You can use the same compiler flags you would use with the 10.4u SDK.

       Keep in mind that these compiler and linker settings will also be used
       when building CPAN modules. For XS modules to be compiled as a
       universal binary, any libraries it links to must also be universal
       binaries. The system libraries that Apple includes with the 10.4u SDK
       are all universal, but user-installed libraries may need to be re-
       installed as universal binaries.

   64-bit Support
       Follow the instructions in INSTALL to build perl with support for
       64-bit integers ("use64bitint") or both 64-bit integers and 64-bit
       addressing ("use64bitall"). In the latter case, the resulting binary
       will run only on G5-based hosts.

       Support for 64-bit addressing is experimental: some aspects of Perl may
       be omitted or buggy. Note the messages output by Configure for further
       information. Please use "perlbug" to submit a problem report in the
       event that you encounter difficulties.

       When building 64-bit modules, it is your responsibility to ensure that
       linked external libraries and frameworks provide 64-bit support: if
       they do not, module building may appear to succeed, but attempts to use
       the module will result in run-time dynamic linking errors, and
       subsequent test failures.  You can use "file" to discover the
       architectures supported by a library:

           $ file libgdbm.3.0.0.dylib
           libgdbm.3.0.0.dylib: Mach-O fat file with 2 architectures
           libgdbm.3.0.0.dylib (for architecture ppc):      Mach-O dynamically linked shared library ppc
           libgdbm.3.0.0.dylib (for architecture ppc64):    Mach-O 64-bit dynamically linked shared library ppc64

       Note that this issue precludes the building of many Macintosh-specific
       CPAN modules ("Mac::*"), as the required Apple frameworks do not
       provide 64-bit support. Similarly, downloads from Fink or Darwinports
       are unlikely to provide 64-bit support; the libraries must be rebuilt
       from source with the appropriate compiler and linker flags. For further
       information, see Apple's 64-Bit Transition Guide at
       <http://developer.apple.com/documentation/Darwin/Conceptual/64bitPorting/index.html>.

   libperl and Prebinding
       Mac OS X ships with a dynamically-loaded libperl, but the default for
       this release is to compile a static libperl. The reason for this is
       pre-binding. Dynamic libraries can be pre-bound to a specific address
       in memory in order to decrease load time. To do this, one needs to be
       aware of the location and size of all previously-loaded libraries.
       Apple collects this information as part of their overall OS build
       process, and thus has easy access to it when building Perl, but
       ordinary users would need to go to a great deal of effort to obtain the
       information needed for pre-binding.

       You can override the default and build a shared libperl if you wish
       (Configure ... -Duseshrplib), but the load time on pre-10.4 OS releases
       will be greater than either the static library, or Apple's pre-bound
       dynamic library.

       With 10.4 "Tiger" and newer, Apple has all but eliminated the
       performance penalty for non-prebound libraries.

   Updating Apple's Perl
       In a word - don't, at least without a *very* good reason. Your scripts
       can just as easily begin with "#!/usr/local/bin/perl" as with
       "#!/usr/bin/perl". Scripts supplied by Apple and other third parties as
       part of installation packages and such have generally only been tested
       with the /usr/bin/perl that's installed by Apple.

       If you find that you do need to update the system Perl, one issue worth
       keeping in mind is the question of static vs. dynamic libraries. If you
       upgrade using the default static libperl, you will find that the
       dynamic libperl supplied by Apple will not be deleted. If both
       libraries are present when an application that links against libperl is
       built, ld will link against the dynamic library by default. So, if you
       need to replace Apple's dynamic libperl with a static libperl, you need
       to be sure to delete the older dynamic library after you've installed
       the update.

   Known problems
       If you have installed extra libraries such as GDBM through Fink (in
       other words, you have libraries under /sw/lib), or libdlcompat to
       /usr/local/lib, you may need to be extra careful when running Configure
       to not to confuse Configure and Perl about which libraries to use.
       Being confused will show up for example as "dyld" errors about symbol
       problems, for example during "make test". The safest bet is to run
       Configure as

           Configure ... -Uloclibpth -Dlibpth=/usr/lib

       to make Configure look only into the system libraries.  If you have
       some extra library directories that you really want to use (such as
       newer Berkeley DB libraries in pre-Panther systems), add those to the
       libpth:

           Configure ... -Uloclibpth -Dlibpth='/usr/lib /opt/lib'

       The default of building Perl statically may cause problems with complex
       applications like Tk: in that case consider building shared Perl

           Configure ... -Duseshrplib

       but remember that there's a startup cost to pay in that case (see above
       "libperl and Prebinding").

       Starting with Tiger (Mac OS X 10.4), Apple shipped broken locale files
       for the eu_ES locale (Basque-Spain).  In previous releases of Perl,
       this resulted in failures in the lib/locale test. These failures have
       been suppressed in the current release of Perl by making the test
       ignore the broken locale.  If you need to use the eu_ES locale, you
       should contact Apple support.

   Cocoa
       There are two ways to use Cocoa from Perl. Apple's PerlObjCBridge
       module, included with Mac OS X, can be used by standalone scripts to
       access Foundation (i.e. non-GUI) classes and objects.

       An alternative is CamelBones, a framework that allows access to both
       Foundation and AppKit classes and objects, so that full GUI
       applications can be built in Perl. CamelBones can be found on
       SourceForge, at <http://www.sourceforge.net/projects/camelbones/>.

Starting From Scratch
       Unfortunately it is not that difficult somehow manage to break one's
       Mac OS X Perl rather severely.  If all else fails and you want to
       really, REALLY, start from scratch and remove even your Apple Perl
       installation (which has become corrupted somehow), the following
       instructions should do it.  Please think twice before following these
       instructions: they are much like conducting brain surgery to yourself.
       Without anesthesia.  We will not come to fix your system if you do
       this.

       First, get rid of the libperl.dylib:

           # cd /System/Library/Perl/darwin/CORE
           # rm libperl.dylib

       Then delete every .bundle file found anywhere in the folders:

           /System/Library/Perl
           /Library/Perl

       You can find them for example by

           # find /System/Library/Perl /Library/Perl -name '*.bundle' -print

       After this you can either copy Perl from your operating system media
       (you will need at least the /System/Library/Perl and /usr/bin/perl), or
       rebuild Perl from the source code with "Configure -Dprefix=/usr
       -Duseshrplib" NOTE: the "-Dprefix=/usr" to replace the system Perl
       works much better with Perl 5.8.1 and later, in Perl 5.8.0 the settings
       were not quite right.

       "Pacifist" from CharlesSoft (<http://www.charlessoft.com/>) is a nice
       way to extract the Perl binaries from the OS media, without having to
       reinstall the entire OS.
