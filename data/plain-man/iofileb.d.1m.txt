iofileb.d(1m)                    USER COMMANDS                   iofileb.d(1m)



NAME
       iofileb.d - I/O bytes by file and process. Uses DTrace.

SYNOPSIS
       iofileb.d

DESCRIPTION
       This prints a summary of requested disk activity by pathname, providing
       totals of the I/O events in bytes. It is a companion  to  the  iofile.d
       script  -  which prints in terms of I/O wait time, not bytes.  I/O wait
       time is a better metric for  understanding  performance  issues.   Both
       disk and NFS I/O are measured.

       Since  this  uses  DTrace, only users with root privileges can run this
       command.

EXAMPLES
       Sample until Ctrl-C is hit then print report,
              # iofileb.d


FIELDS
       PID    process ID

       CMD    process name

       KB     kilobytes of disk I/O

       FILE   file pathname


DOCUMENTATION
       See the DTraceToolkit for further documentation under the  Docs  direc-
       tory. The DTraceToolkit docs may include full worked examples with ver-
       bose descriptions explaining the output.

EXIT
       iofileb.d will sample until Ctrl-C is hit.
