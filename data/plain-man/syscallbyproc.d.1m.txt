syscallbyproc.d(1m)              USER COMMANDS             syscallbyproc.d(1m)



NAME
       syscallbyproc.d - syscalls by process name. Uses DTrace.

SYNOPSIS
       syscallbyproc.d

DESCRIPTION
       syscallbyproc.d  is a DTrace OneLiner to a report of the number of sys-
       tem calls made by process name.

       This is useful to identify which process is  causing  the  most  system
       calls.

       Docs/oneliners.txt   and  Docs/Examples/oneliners_examples.txt  in  the
       DTraceToolkit contain this as a oneliner that  can  be  cut-n-paste  to
       run.

       Since  this  uses  DTrace, only users with root privileges can run this
       command.

EXAMPLES
       This samples until Ctrl-C is hit.
              # syscallbyproc.d


FIELDS
       first field
              This is the process name. There may be several  PIDs  that  have
              the  same  process  name, for example with numerous instances of
              "bash". The value reported will be the sum of them all.

       second field
              This is the count, the number of system calls made.


DOCUMENTATION
       See the DTraceToolkit for further documentation under the  Docs  direc-
       tory. The DTraceToolkit docs may include full worked examples with ver-
       bose descriptions explaining the output.

EXIT
       syscallbyproc.d will sample until Ctrl-C is hit.
