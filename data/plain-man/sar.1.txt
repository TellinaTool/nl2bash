NAME
     sar -- system activity reporter

SYNOPSIS
     sar [-dgpu] [-n mode] [-o filename] t [n]
     sar [-dgpu] [-n mode] [-e time] [-f filename] [-i seconds] [-s time]

DESCRIPTION
     The sar command is used to sample and report various cumulative statistic
     counters maintained by the operating system.  It can be invoked in two
     different ways.

     In the first usage instance, n samples are reported at t second inter-
     vals.  If n is not specified, only one sample will be captured.  When the
     -o option is specified, sar will write the binary sampling data to the
     output file specified by filename.

     In the second usage instance, there is no on-going sample interval to
     specify.  This is because the sampling input comes from a previously
     recorded, binary activity file.  The binary activity file can be speci-
     fied using the -f filename option.  When the -f option isn't used, sar
     attempts to open a default binary activity file, /var/log/sa/sadd, where
     dd represents the current day of the month.

     The starting and ending time of the report can be restricted using the -e
     and -s options.  Here, the time field is specified in the form
     hh[:mm[:ss]].

     Finally, the -i option can be used to select the sampling interval.  Only
     records at least seconds apart will be reported.  When the -i option is
     not used, all of the previously recorded interval samples are reported.

     Due to the nature of on-going sample collection, the data is reported in
     a verbose mode when more than one sampling option is specified.  Column
     headers are printed at the beginning of the report; averages are printed
     when the sar command terminates.

OPTIONS
     The following options restrict the sample set that sar reports.

     -d       Report disk activity.

              device   The BSD name of the device.

              r+w/s    The number of reads and writes per second.

              blks/s   Number of blocks (in device's default blocksize) trans-
                       ferred to a device per second.

     -g       Report page-out activity.

              pgout/s  The number of pages paged out per second.

     -p       Report page-in and page fault activity

              pgin/s   The number of pages paged in per second.

              pflts/s  The number of faults that caused a page to be copied in
                       per second.

              vflts/s  The number of times vm_fault routine has been called.

     -n mode  Report network activity with modes DEV, EDEV, or PPP.  Multiple
              network modes can be specified.

              DEV      The DEV mode reports network device statistics.  The
                       following information is displayed for each interface.

                       IFACE     The network interface name.

                       Ipkts/s   The number of packets received per second.

                       Ibytes/s  The number of bytes received per second.

                       Opkts/s   The number of packets sent per second.

                       Obytes/s  The number of bytes sent per second.

              EDEV     The EDEV mode reports network device error statistics.
                       The following information is displayed for each inter-
                       face.

                       IFACE    The interface name.

                       Ierrs/s  The input errors per second.

                       Oerrs/s  The output errors per second.

                       Coll/s   The collisions that occurred per second.

                       Drops/s  The number of dropped packets per second.

              PPP      The PPP mode must be specified in order to display ppp
                       connections in the network statistics. This will also
                       turn on the PPP modify mode in sadc (8) when sampling
                       data is not being read from a file.  By default, both
                       the collection and reporting of ppp statistics is
                       turned off.  See sadc (8).

     -u       Report CPU activity (default)

              %usr, %sys, and %idle

              These report the percentage of time running in user mode, system
              mode and idle.

FILES
     /var/log/sa/sadd  Default daily activity file that holds the binary sam-
                       pling data.  dd are digits that represent the day of
                       the month.
