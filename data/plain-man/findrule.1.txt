NAME
       findrule - command line wrapper to File::Find::Rule

USAGE
         findrule [path...] [expression]

DESCRIPTION
       "findrule" mostly borrows the interface from GNU find(1) to provide a
       command-line interface onto the File::Find::Rule heirarchy of modules.

       The syntax for expressions is the rule name, preceded by a dash,
       followed by an optional argument.  If the argument is an opening
       parenthesis it is taken as a list of arguments, terminated by a closing
       parenthesis.

       Some examples:

        find -file -name ( foo bar )

       files named "foo" or "bar", below the current directory.

        find -file -name foo -bar

       files named "foo", that have pubs (for this is what our ficticious
       "bar" clause specifies), below the current directory.

        find -file -name ( -bar )

       files named "-bar", below the current directory.  In this case if we'd
       have omitted the parenthesis it would have parsed as a call to name
       with no arguments, followed by a call to -bar.

   Supported switches
       I'm very slack.  Please consult the File::Find::Rule manpage for now,
       and prepend - to the commands that you want.

   Extra bonus switches
       findrule automatically loads all of your installed File::Find::Rule::*
       extension modules, so check the documentation to see what those would
       be.
