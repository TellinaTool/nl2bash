DESCRIPTION
       PHP  is  a widely-used general-purpose scripting language that is espe-
       cially suited for Web development and can be embedded into  HTML.  This
       is the command line interface that enables you to do the following:

       You  can  parse and execute files by using parameter -f followed by the
       name of the file to be executed.

       Using parameter -r you can directly execute  PHP  code  simply  as  you
       would do inside a .php file when using the eval() function.

       It  is  also  possible to process the standard input line by line using
       either the parameter -R or -F. In this mode each  separate  input  line
       causes  the code specified by -R or the file specified by -F to be exe-
       cuted.  You can access the input line by $argn.  While  processing  the
       input  lines  $argi  contains  the number of the actual line being pro-
       cessed. Further more the parameters -B and -E can be  used  to  execute
       code  (see  -r)  before  and  after all input lines have been processed
       respectively. Notice that the input is read from  STDIN  and  therefore
       reading  from  STDIN  explicitly  changes  the next input line or skips
       input lines.

       PHP also contains an built-in web server  for  application  development
       purpose.  By  using  the  -S  option  where  addr:port point to a local
       address and port PHP will listen to HTTP requests on that  address  and
       port  and serve files from the current working directory or the docroot
       passed by the -t option.

       If none of -r -f -B -R -F -E or -S is present but a single parameter is
       given then this parameter is taken as the filename to parse and execute
       (same as with -f). If no parameter is present then the  standard  input
       is read and executed.

OPTIONS
       --interactive
       -a             Run  PHP  interactively. This lets you enter snippets of
                      PHP code that directly get executed. When readline  sup-
                      port  is  enabled  you  can edit the lines and also have
                      history support.

       --bindpath address:port|port
       -b address:port|port
                      Bind Path for external FASTCGI Server mode (CGI only).

       --no-chdir
       -C             Do not chdir to the script's directory (CGI only).

       --no-header
       -q             Quiet-mode. Suppress HTTP header output (CGI only).

       --timing count
       -T count       Measure execution time of script  repeated  count  times
                      (CGI only).

       --php-ini path|file
       -c path|file   Look  for  php.ini file in the directory path or use the
                      specified file

       --no-php-ini
       -n             No php.ini file will be used

       --define foo[=bar]
       -d foo[=bar]   Define INI entry foo with value bar

                      when a php script is started as a daemon and the command
                      line contains sensitive data such as passwords.

       --ri           name Shows configuration for extension name

FILES
       php-cli.ini    The configuration file for the CLI version of PHP.

       php.ini        The standard configuration file will only be  used  when
                      php-cli.ini cannot be found.

EXAMPLES
       php -r 'echo "Hello World\n";'
            This command simply writes the text "Hello World" to standard out.

       php -r 'print_r(gd_info());'
            This shows the configuration of your gd  extension.  You  can  use
            this  to easily check which image formats you can use. If you have
            any dynamic modules you may want to use the same ini file that php
            uses  when executed from your webserver. There are more extensions
            which have such a function. For dba use:
            php -r 'print_r(dba_handlers(1));'

       php -R 'echo strip_tags($argn)."\n";'
            This PHP command strips off the HTML tags line by line and outputs
            the  result. To see how it works you can first look at the follow-
            ing PHP command 'php -d html_errors=1 -i' which uses PHP to output
            HTML  formatted  configuration  information.  If  you then combine
            those two 'php ...|php ...' you'll see what happens.

       php -E 'echo "Lines: $argi\n";'
            Using this PHP command you can count the lines being input.

       php -R '@$l+=count(file($argn));' -E 'echo "Lines:$l\n";'
            In this example PHP expects each  input  line  being  a  file.  It
            counts  all  lines  of  the files specified by each input line and
            shows the summarized result.  You may combine this with tools like
            find and change the php scriptlet.

       php -R 'echo "$argn\n"; fgets(STDIN);'
            Since you have access to STDIN from within -B -R -F and -E you can
            skip certain input lines with your code. But  note  that  in  such
            cases  $argi  only counts the lines being processed by php itself.
            Having read this you will guess what the above program does: skip-
            ping every second input line.

TIPS
       You  can  use  a shebang line to automatically invoke php from scripts.
       Only the CLI version of PHP will ignore such  a  first  line  as  shown
       below:

              #!/bin/php
              <?php
               // your script
              ?>
