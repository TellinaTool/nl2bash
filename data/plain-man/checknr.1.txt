CHECKNR(1)                BSD General Commands Manual               CHECKNR(1)

NAME
     checknr -- check nroff/troff files

SYNOPSIS
     checknr [-a.x1.y1.x2.y2. ... .xn.yn] [-c.x1.x2.x3 ... .xn] [-s] [-f] file

DESCRIPTION
     The checknr utility checks a list of nroff(1) or troff(1) input files for
     certain kinds of errors involving mismatched opening and closing delim-
     iters and unknown commands.  If no files are specified, checknr checks
     the standard input.

     The following options are available:

     -a      Add additional pairs of macros to the list of known macros.  This
             must be followed by groups of six characters, each group defining
             a pair of macros.  The six characters are a period, the first
             macro name, another period, and the second macro name.  For exam-
             ple, to define a pair .BS and .ES, use `-a.BS.ES'

     -c      Define commands which would otherwise be complained about as
             undefined.

     -f      Request checknr to ignore `\f' font changes.

     -s      Ignore `\s' size changes.

     Delimiters checked are:

     1.   Font changes using \fx ... \fP.

     2.   Size changes using \sx ... \s0.

     3.   Macros that come in open ... close forms, for example, the .TS and
          .TE macros which must always come in pairs.

     The checknr utility is intended for use on documents that are prepared
     with checknr in mind, much the same as lint(1).  It expects a certain
     document writing style for `\f' and `\s' commands, in that each `\fx'
     must be terminated with `\fP' and each `\sx' must be terminated with
     `\s0'.  While it will work to directly go into the next font or explic-
     itly specify the original font or point size, and many existing documents
     actually do this, such a practice will produce complaints from checknr.
     Since it is probably better to use the `\fP' and `\s0' forms anyway, you
     should think of this as a contribution to your document preparation
     style.

     The checknr utility knows about the ms(7) and me(7) macro packages.

DIAGNOSTICS
     Complaints about unmatched delimiters.  Complaints about unrecognized
     commands.  Various complaints about the syntax of commands.

BUGS
     There is no way to define a 1 character macro name using -a.

     Does not correctly recognize certain reasonable constructs, such as con-
     ditionals.

HISTORY
     The checknr command appeared in 4.0BSD.
