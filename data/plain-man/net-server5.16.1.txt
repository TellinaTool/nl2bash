NAME
       net-server - Base Net::Server starting module

SYNOPSIS
           net-server [base type] [net server arguments]

           net-server PreFork ipv '*'

           net-server HTTP

           net-server HTTP app foo.cgi

           net-server HTTP app foo.cgi app /=bar.cgi

           net-server HTTP port 8080 port 8443/ssl ipv '*' server_type PreFork --SSL_key_file=my.key --SSL_cert_file=my.crt access_log_file STDERR

DESCRIPTION
       The net-server program gives a simple way to test out code and try port
       connection parameters.  Though the running server can be robust enough
       for full tim use, it is anticipated that this binary will just be used
       for basic testing of net-server ports, acting as a simple echo server,
       or for running development scripts as CGI.

OPTIONS
       "base type"
           The very first argument may be a Net::Server flavor.  This is given
           as shorthand for writing out server_type "ServerFlavor".
           Additionally, this allows types such as HTTP and PSGI, which are
           not true Net::Server base types, to subclass other server types via
           an additional server_type argument.

               net-server PreFork

               net-server HTTP  # becomes a HTTP server in the Fork flavor

               net-server HTTP server_type PreFork  # preforking HTTP server

       "port"
           Port to bind upon.  Default is 80 if running a HTTP server as root,
           8080 if running a HTTP server as non-root, or 20203 otherwise.

           Multiple value can be given for binding to multiple ports.  All of
           the methods for specifying port attributes enumerated in
           Net::Server and Net::Server::Proto are available here.

               net-server port 20201

               net-server port 20202

               net-server port 20203/IPv6

       "host"
           Host to bind to.  Default is *.  Will bind to an IPv4 socket if an
           IPv4 address is given.  Will bind to an IPv6 socket if an IPv6
           address is given (requires installation of IO::Socket::INET6).

           If a hostname is given and "ipv" is still set to 4, an IPv4 socket
           will be created.  If a hostname is given and "ipv" is set to 6, an
           IPv6 socket will be created.  If a hostname is given and "ipv" is
           set to * (default), a lookup will be performed and any available
           IPv4 or IPv6 addresses will be bound.  The "ipv" parameter can be
           set directly, or passed along in the port, or additionally can be
           passed as part of the hostname.

               net-server host localhost

               net-server host localhost/IPv4

       There are many more options available.  Please see the Net::Server
       documentation.
