BASHBUG(1)                                                          BASHBUG(1)



NAME
       bashbug - report a bug in bash

SYNOPSIS
       bashbug [address]

DESCRIPTION
       bashbug is a shell script to help the user compose and mail bug reports
       concerning bash in a standard format.  bashbug invokes the editor spec-
       ified by the environment variable EDITOR on a temporary copy of the bug
       report format outline. The user must fill in the appropriate fields and
       exit  the  editor.   bashbug  then  mails  the completed report to bug-
       bash@gnu.org, or address.  If the report cannot be mailed, it is  saved
       in the file dead.bashbug in the invoking user's home directory.

       The  bug report format outline consists of several sections.  The first
       section provides information about the machine, operating  system,  the
       bash  version,  and  the  compilation  environment.  The second section
       should be filled in with a description of the bug.  The  third  section
       should  be  a  description  of  how to reproduce the bug.  The optional
       fourth section is for a proposed fix.  Fixes are encouraged.

ENVIRONMENT
       bashbug will utilize the following environment variables if they exist:

       EDITOR Specifies  the  preferred  editor. If EDITOR is not set, bashbug
              defaults to emacs.

       HOME   Directory in which the failed bug report is saved  if  the  mail
              fails.
