DESCRIPTION
       grolbp is a driver for groff that produces output in CAPSL and VDM for-
       mat suitable for Canon LBP-4 and LBP-8 printers.

       For  compatibility  with  grolj4 there is an additional drawing command
       available:

       \D'R dh dv'
              Draw a rule (i.e. a solid black rectangle), with one  corner  at
              the  current position, and the diagonally opposite corner at the
              current position +(dh,dv).

OPTIONS
       Note that there can be whitespace between a one-letter option  and  its
       argument;  on  the other hand, there must be whitespace and/or an equal
       sign (`=') between a long-name option and its argument.

       -cnumcopies
       --copies=numcopies
              Print numcopies copies of each page.

       -l
       --landscape
              Print the document with a landscape orientation.

       -ppaper_size
       --papersize=paper_size
              Set the paper size to paper_size, which must be  a  valid  paper
              size description as indicated in the section PAPER SIZES.

       -oorientation
       --orientation=orientation
              Print  the  document with orientation orientation, which must be
              `portrait' or `landscape'.

       -wwidth
       --linewidth=width
              Set the default line thickness to width thousandths  of  an  em.
              If  this  option isn't specified, the line thickness defaults to
              0.04 em.

       -v
       --version
              Print the version number.

       -Fdir
       --fontdir=dir
              Prepend directory dir/devname to the search path  for  font  and
              device description files; name is the name of the device, usual-
              ly lbp.

       -h
       --help Print a short help text.

TYPEFACES
       The driver supports the Dutch, Swiss and  Swiss-Narrow  scalable  type-
       faces,  each  one  in the Regular, Bold, Italic and Bold-Italic styles.
       Additionally, the Courier and Elite monospaced typefaces at the sizes 8
       and  12 points (for Courier) resp. 8 and 10 points (for Elite) are sup-
       ported, each one in the Regular, Bold and Italic styles.

       The following chart summarizes the font names you  can  use  to  access
       these fonts:


          +----------------+-----------+--------+----------+--------------+
          |   Typeface     |  Regular  |  Bold  |  Italic  |  Bold-Italic |

          +----------------+-----------+--------+----------+--------------+

PAPER SIZES
       The paper size can be set in the DESC file or with command line options
       to grolbp.  If the paper size is specified both ways, the command  line
       options  take  precedence  over the contents of the DESC file (this ap-
       plies to the page orientation too).

       See groff_font(1) how to set the paper dimensions in the DESC file.

       To set the paper size in the command line, add

         -p paper-size

       or

         --papersize=paper-size

       to the other grolbp options, where paper-size is in the same format  as
       in the DESC file.

       If  no  paper size is specified in the DESC file or the command line, a
       default size of A4 is used.

PAGE ORIENTATION
       As with the page size, the orientation of the printed page (portrait or
       landscape)  can  be  set in the DESC file or with command line options.
       It is also case insensitive.

       To set the orientation in the DESC file, insert a line with the follow-
       ing content:

         orientation [portrait|landscape]

       Only the first valid orientation command in the DESC file is used.

       To  set  the page orientation with command line options you can use the
       -o or --orientation option with the same parameters (portrait or  land-
       scape)  as in the DESC file.  Or you can use the -l option to force the
       pages to be printed in landscape.

FONT FILE FORMAT
       In addition to the usual commands described  in  groff_font(5),  grolbp
       provides  the  command  lbpname  which  sets  the font name sent to the
       printer when requesting this font.  The syntax of this command is:

         lbpname printer_font_name

       o      For bitmapped fonts, printer_font_name has the form

                N<base_fontname><font_style>

              base_fontname is the font name as it  appears  in  the  printers
              font  listings  without the first letter, up to (but not includ-
              ing) the font size.  font_style can be one of the letters R,  I,
              or  B, indicating the font styles Roman, Italic and Bold respec-
              tively.

              For instance,  if  the  printer's  font  listing  A  shows  font
              `Nelite12I.ISO_USA',  the  corresponding  entry  in the font de-
              scription file is

                lbpname NeliteI

              Note that you may need to modify grolbp to add support  for  new
              bitmapped  fonts,  since the available font names and font sizes
              of bitmapped fonts (as documented above) are hard-coded into the
              program.

       o      For  scalable  fonts, printer_font_name is identical to the font
              name as it appears in the printer's font listing A.

              For instance, to select the `Swiss' font in  bold  style,  which
              appears in the printer's font listing A as `Swiss-Bold', the re-
              quired lbpname command line is

                lbpname Swiss-Bold


       The argument of lbpname is case sensitive.
