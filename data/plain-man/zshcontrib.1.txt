ZSHCONTRIB(1)                                                    ZSHCONTRIB(1)



NAME
       zshcontrib - user contributions to zsh

DESCRIPTION
       The  Zsh  source distribution includes a number of items contributed by
       the user community.  These are not inherently a part of the shell,  and
       some may not be available in every zsh installation.  The most signifi-
       cant of these are documented here.  For documentation on other contrib-
       uted  items  such as shell functions, look for comments in the function
       source files.



UTILITIES
   Accessing On-Line Help
       The key sequence ESC h is normally bound by ZLE to execute the run-help
       widget  (see  zshzle(1)).   This  invokes the run-help command with the
       command word from the current input line as its argument.  By  default,
       run-help  is an alias for the man command, so this often fails when the
       command word is  a  shell  builtin  or  a  user-defined  function.   By
       redefining  the  run-help  alias, one can improve the on-line help pro-
       vided by the shell.

       The helpfiles utility, found in the Util directory of the distribution,
       is a Perl program that can be used to process the zsh manual to produce
       a separate help file for each shell builtin and for  many  other  shell
       features  as  well.  The autoloadable run-help function, found in Func-
       tions/Misc, searches for these helpfiles  and  performs  several  other
       tests to produce the most complete help possible for the command.

       Help files are installed by default to a subdirectory of /usr/share/zsh
       or /usr/local/share/zsh.

       To create your own help files with helpfiles, choose or create a direc-
       tory where the individual command help files will reside.  For example,
       you might choose ~/zsh_help.  If you unpacked the zsh  distribution  in
       your home directory, you would use the commands:

              mkdir ~/zsh_help
              perl ~/zsh-5.0.8/Util/helpfiles ~/zsh_help

       The  HELPDIR parameter tells run-help where to look for the help files.
       When unset, it uses the default installation path.  To use your own set
       of  help files, set this to the appropriate path in one of your startup
       files:

              HELPDIR=~/zsh_help

       To use the run-help function, you need to add lines something like  the
       following to your .zshrc or equivalent startup file:

              unalias run-help
              autoload run-help

       Note  that  in order for `autoload run-help' to work, the run-help file
       must be in one of the directories named in your fpath array  (see  zsh-
       param(1)).   This should already be the case if you have a standard zsh
       installation; if it is not, copy Functions/Misc/run-help to  an  appro-
       priate directory.


   Recompiling Functions
       If  you frequently edit your zsh functions, or periodically update your
       zsh installation to track the latest developments, you  may  find  that
       function  digests compiled with the zcompile builtin are frequently out
       of date with respect to the function source files.  This is not usually
       a  problem, because zsh always looks for the newest file when loading a
       function, but it may cause slower shell startup and  function  loading.
       Also,  if  a digest file is explicitly used as an element of fpath, zsh
       won't check whether any of its source files has changed.

       The zrecompile autoloadable function, found in Functions/Misc,  can  be
       used to keep function digests up to date.

       zrecompile [ -qt ] [ name ... ]
       zrecompile [ -qt ] -p arg ... [ -- arg ... ]
              This tries to find *.zwc files and automatically re-compile them
              if at least one of the original files is newer than the compiled
              file.  This works only if the names stored in the compiled files
              are full paths or are relative to the  directory  that  contains
              the .zwc file.

              In the first form, each name is the name of a compiled file or a
              directory containing *.zwc files that should be checked.  If  no
              arguments  are  given,  the directories and *.zwc files in fpath
              are used.

              When -t is given, no compilation is performed, but a return sta-
              tus  of  zero  (true)  is set if there are files that need to be
              re-compiled and non-zero (false) otherwise.  The -q option  qui-
              ets the chatty output that describes what zrecompile is doing.

              Without  the  -t  option, the return status is zero if all files
              that needed re-compilation could be  compiled  and  non-zero  if
              compilation for at least one of the files failed.

              If  the  -p  option is given, the args are interpreted as one or
              more sets of arguments for zcompile,  separated  by  `--'.   For
              example:

                     zrecompile -p \
                                -R ~/.zshrc -- \
                                -M ~/.zcompdump -- \
                                ~/zsh/comp.zwc ~/zsh/Completion/*/_*

              This  compiles  ~/.zshrc into ~/.zshrc.zwc if that doesn't exist
              or if it is older than  ~/.zshrc.  The  compiled  file  will  be
              marked  for  reading  instead  of  mapping. The same is done for
              ~/.zcompdump and ~/.zcompdump.zwc, but  this  compiled  file  is
              marked   for   mapping.   The  last  line  re-creates  the  file
              ~/zsh/comp.zwc if any of the files matching the given pattern is
              newer than it.

              Without  the  -p  option,  zrecompile  does  not create function
              digests that do not already exist, nor does it add new functions
              to the digest.

       The  following  shell loop is an example of a method for creating func-
       tion digests for all functions in your fpath, assuming  that  you  have
       write permission to the directories:

              for ((i=1; i <= $#fpath; ++i)); do
                dir=$fpath[i]
                zwc=${dir:t}.zwc
                if [[ $dir == (.|..) || $dir == (.|..)/* ]]; then
                  continue
                fi
                files=($dir/*(N-.))
                if [[ -w $dir:h && -n $files ]]; then
                  files=(${${(M)files%/*/*}#/})
                  if ( cd $dir:h &&
                       zrecompile -p -U -z $zwc $files ); then
                    fpath[i]=$fpath[i].zwc
                  fi
                fi
              done

       The  -U and -z options are appropriate for functions in the default zsh
       installation fpath; you may need to use different options for your per-
       sonal function directories.

       Once  the digests have been created and your fpath modified to refer to
       them, you can keep them up to date by running zrecompile with no  argu-
       ments.


   Keyboard Definition
       The  large  number of possible combinations of keyboards, workstations,
       terminals, emulators, and window systems makes it impossible for zsh to
       have  built-in  key  bindings  for  every situation.  The zkbd utility,
       found in Functions/Misc, can help you quickly create key  bindings  for
       your configuration.

       Run zkbd either as an autoloaded function, or as a shell script:

              zsh -f ~/zsh-5.0.8/Functions/Misc/zkbd

       When  you  run  zkbd, it first asks you to enter your terminal type; if
       the default it offers is correct, just press return.  It then asks  you
       to  press  a  number  of different keys to determine characteristics of
       your keyboard and terminal; zkbd warns you if it finds anything out  of
       the ordinary, such as a Delete key that sends neither ^H nor ^?.

       The  keystrokes  read by zkbd are recorded as a definition for an asso-
       ciative array named key, written to a file in  the  subdirectory  .zkbd
       within  either your HOME or ZDOTDIR directory.  The name of the file is
       composed from  the  TERM,  VENDOR  and  OSTYPE  parameters,  joined  by
       hyphens.

       You  may  read  this file into your .zshrc or another startup file with
       the `source' or `.' commands, then reference the key parameter in bind-
       key commands, like this:

              source ${ZDOTDIR:-$HOME}/.zkbd/$TERM-$VENDOR-$OSTYPE
              [[ -n ${key[Left]} ]] && bindkey "${key[Left]}" backward-char
              [[ -n ${key[Right]} ]] && bindkey "${key[Right]}" forward-char
              # etc.

       Note  that  in order for `autoload zkbd' to work, the zkdb file must be
       in one of the directories named in your fpath array (see  zshparam(1)).
       This  should  already  be the case if you have a standard zsh installa-
       tion; if it is not, copy Functions/Misc/zkbd to an  appropriate  direc-
       tory.


   Dumping Shell State
       Occasionally  you  may encounter what appears to be a bug in the shell,
       particularly if you are using a beta version of zsh  or  a  development
       release.  Usually it is sufficient to send a description of the problem
       to one of the zsh mailing lists (see zsh(1)), but sometimes one of  the
       zsh developers will need to recreate your environment in order to track
       the problem down.

       The script named reporter, found in the Util directory of the distribu-
       tion,  is  provided for this purpose.  (It is also possible to autoload
       reporter, but reporter is not installed in  fpath  by  default.)   This
       script  outputs  a  detailed  dump  of  the shell state, in the form of
       another script that can be read with `zsh -f' to recreate that state.

       To use reporter, read the script into your shell with the  `.'  command
       and redirect the output into a file:

              . ~/zsh-5.0.8/Util/reporter > zsh.report

       You should check the zsh.report file for any sensitive information such
       as passwords and delete them by hand before sending the script  to  the
       developers.   Also,  as the output can be voluminous, it's best to wait
       for the developers to ask for this information before sending it.

       You can also use reporter to dump only a subset  of  the  shell  state.
       This is sometimes useful for creating startup files for the first time.
       Most of the output from reporter is far more detailed than  usually  is
       necessary  for  a  startup  file, but the aliases, options, and zstyles
       states may be  useful  because  they  include  only  changes  from  the
       defaults.   The bindings state may be useful if you have created any of
       your own keymaps, because reporter arranges to dump the keymap creation
       commands as well as the bindings for every keymap.

       As  is  usual  with  automated tools, if you create a startup file with
       reporter, you should edit the results to remove  unnecessary  commands.
       Note  that  if  you're  using the new completion system, you should not
       dump the functions state to your startup files with reporter;  use  the
       compdump function instead (see zshcompsys(1)).

       reporter [ state ... ]
              Print  to  standard  output  the indicated subset of the current
              shell state.  The state arguments may be one or more of:

              all    Output everything listed below.
              aliases
                     Output alias definitions.
              bindings
                     Output ZLE key maps and bindings.
              completion
                     Output old-style compctl  commands.   New  completion  is
                     covered by functions and zstyles.
              functions
                     Output autoloads and function definitions.
              limits Output limit commands.
              options
                     Output setopt commands.
              styles Same as zstyles.
              variables
                     Output  shell parameter assignments, plus export commands
                     for any environment variables.
              zstyles
                     Output zstyle commands.

              If the state is omitted, all is assumed.

       With the exception of `all', every state can be abbreviated by any pre-
       fix, even a single letter; thus a is the same as aliases, z is the same
       as zstyles, etc.


   Manipulating Hook Functions
       add-zsh-hook [ -dD ] [ -Uzk ] hook function
              Several functions are special to the shell, as described in  the
              section  SPECIAL  FUNCTIONS,  see  zshmisc(1),  in that they are
              automatic called at a specific  point  during  shell  execution.
              Each has an associated array consisting of names of functions to
              be called at the same point; these  are  so-called  `hook  func-
              tions'.   The  shell function add-zsh-hook provides a simple way
              of adding or removing functions from the array.

              hook is one of chpwd, periodic, precmd, preexec,  zshaddhistory,
              zshexit,  or  zsh_directory_name, the special functions in ques-
              tion.  Note that zsh_directory_name is called in a different way
              from  the  other  functions,  but  may still be manipulated as a
              hook.

              function is name of an ordinary shell function.  If  no  options
              are  given  this  will  be added to the array of functions to be
              executed in the given context.

              If the option -d is given, the  function  is  removed  from  the
              array of functions to be executed.

              If  the option -D is given, the function is treated as a pattern
              and any matching names of functions are removed from  the  array
              of functions to be executed.

              The  options  -U,  -z and -k are passed as arguments to autoload
              for function.  For functions contributed with zsh,  the  options
              -Uz are appropriate.


REMEMBERING RECENT DIRECTORIES
       The function cdr allows you to change the working directory to a previ-
       ous working directory from a list maintained automatically.  It is sim-
       ilar  in  concept  to the directory stack controlled by the pushd, popd
       and dirs builtins, but is more  configurable,  and  as  it  stores  all
       entries  in  files  it  is  maintained across sessions and (by default)
       between terminal emulators in the current session.  (The  pushd  direc-
       tory stack is not actually modified or used by cdr unless you configure
       it to do so as described in the configuration section below.)


   Installation
       The system works by means of a hook function that is called every  time
       the  directory  changes.   To install the system, autoload the required
       functions and use the add-zsh-hook function described above:

              autoload -Uz chpwd_recent_dirs cdr add-zsh-hook
              add-zsh-hook chpwd chpwd_recent_dirs

       Now every time you change directly interactively, no matter which  com-
       mand  you  use, the directory to which you change will be remembered in
       most-recent-first order.


   Use
       All direct user interaction is via the cdr function.

       The argument to cdr is  a  number  N  corresponding  to  the  Nth  most
       recently  changed-to  directory.  1 is the immediately preceding direc-
       tory; the current directory is remembered but is not offered as a  des-
       tination.  Note that if you have multiple windows open 1 may refer to a
       directory changed to in another window; you can avoid  this  by  having
       per-terminal   files   for  storing  directory  as  described  for  the
       recent-dirs-file style below.

       If you set the  recent-dirs-default  style  described  below  cdr  will
       behave the same as cd if given a non-numeric argument, or more than one
       argument.  The recent directory list is updated just the  same  however
       you change directory.

       If  the  argument is omitted, 1 is assumed.  This is similar to pushd's
       behaviour of swapping the two most recent directories on the stack.

       Completion for the argument to cdr is available if  compinit  has  been
       run; menu selection is recommended, using:

              zstyle ':completion:*:*:cdr:*:*' menu selection

       to  allow  you  to  cycle through recent directories; the order is pre-
       served, so the first choice is the most  recent  directory  before  the
       current  one.   The  verbose  style  is  also recommended to ensure the
       directory is shown; this style  is  on  by  default  so  no  action  is
       required unless you have changed it.


   Options
       The behaviour of cdr may be modified by the following options.

       -l     lists  the numbers and the corresponding directories in abbrevi-
              ated form (i.e. with ~ substitution reapplied),  one  per  line.
              The directories here are not quoted (this would only be an issue
              if a directory name contained a newline).  This is used  by  the
              completion system.

       -r     sets  the  variable  reply  to  the  current set of directories.
              Nothing is printed and the directory is not changed.

       -e     allows you to edit the list of directories, one per  line.   The
              list can be edited to any extent you like; no sanity checking is
              performed.  Completion is available.  No  quoting  is  necessary
              (except  for  newlines,  where  I have in any case no sympathy);
              directories are in unabbreviated from and  contain  an  absolute
              path, i.e. they start with /.  Usually the first entry should be
              left as the current directory.


   Configuration
       Configuration is by means of the styles mechanism that should be famil-
       iar  from completion; if not, see the description of the zstyle command
       in see  zshmodules(1).   The  context  for  setting  styles  should  be
       ':chpwd:*'  in  case  the meaning of the context is extended in future,
       for example:

              zstyle ':chpwd:*' recent-dirs-max 0

       sets the value of the recent-dirs-max style  to  0.   In  practice  the
       style name is specific enough that a context of '*' should be fine.

       An  exception  is  recent-dirs-insert, which is used exclusively by the
       completion system and  so  has  the  usual  completion  system  context
       (':completion:*'  if nothing more specific is needed), though again '*'
       should be fine in practice.

       recent-dirs-default
              If true, and the command is expecting a recent directory  index,
              and  either  there  is more than one argument or the argument is
              not an integer, then fall through to "cd".  This allows the lazy
              to  use  only  one  command  for directory changing.  Completion
              recognises this, too; see recent-dirs-insert for how to  control
              completion when this option is in use.

       recent-dirs-file
              The file where the list of directories is saved.  The default is
              ${ZDOTDIR:-$HOME}/.chpwd-recent-dirs, i.e. this is in your  home
              directory  unless  you  have  set  the variable ZDOTDIR to point
              somewhere else.  Directory names  are  saved  in  $'...'  quoted
              form,  so  each line in the file can be supplied directly to the
              shell as an argument.

              The value of this style may be an  array.   In  this  case,  the
              first  file  in the list will always be used for saving directo-
              ries while any other files are left untouched.  When reading the
              recent  directory list, if there are fewer than the maximum num-
              ber of entries in the first file, the contents of later files in
              the array will be appended with duplicates removed from the list
              shown.  The contents of the two files are not  sorted  together,
              i.e.  all  the  entries  in the first file are shown first.  The
              special value + can appear in the list to indicate  the  default
              file should be read at that point.  This allows effects like the
              following:

                     zstyle ':chpwd:*' recent-dirs-file \
                     ~/.chpwd-recent-dirs-${TTY##*/} +

              Recent directories are read from a file  numbered  according  to
              the  terminal.   If  there  are insufficient entries the list is
              supplemented from the default file.

              It is possible to use zstyle -e to make  the  directory  config-
              urable at run time:

                     zstyle -e ':chpwd:*' recent-dirs-file pick-recent-dirs-file
                     pick-recent-dirs-file() {
                       if [[ $PWD = ~/text/writing(|/*) ]]; then
                         reply=(~/.chpwd-recent-dirs-writing)
                       else
                         reply=(+)
                       fi
                     }

              In this example, if the current directory is ~/text/writing or a
              directory under it, then use a special file  for  saving  recent
              directories, else use the default.

       recent-dirs-insert
              Used  by  completion.  If recent-dirs-default is true, then set-
              ting this to true causes the actual directory, rather  than  its
              index,  to  be  inserted  on the command line; this has the same
              effect as using the corresponding index, but makes  the  history
              clearer and the line easier to edit.  With this setting, if part
              of an argument was already typed,  normal  directory  completion
              rather than recent directory completion is done; this is because
              recent directory completion is expected to be  done  by  cycling
              through entries menu fashion.

              If  the  value of the style is always, then only recent directo-
              ries will be completed; in that case, use the  cd  command  when
              you want to complete other directories.

              If  the  value  is  fallback,  recent  directories will be tried
              first, then normal directory completion is performed  if  recent
              directory completion failed to find a match.

              Finally,  if the value is both then both sets of completions are
              presented; the usual tag mechanism can be  used  to  distinguish
              results,  with  recent  directories tagged as recent-dirs.  Note
              that the recent directories inserted are abbreviated with direc-
              tory names where appropriate.

       recent-dirs-max
              The  maximum number of directories to save to the file.  If this
              is zero or negative there is no maximum.   The  default  is  20.
              Note  this  includes the current directory, which isn't offered,
              so the highest number of directories you will be offered is  one
              less than the maximum.

       recent-dirs-prune
              This  style  is an array determining what directories should (or
              should not) be added to the recent list.  Elements of the  array
              can include:

              parent Prune  parents  (more  accurately,  ancestors)  from  the
                     recent list.  If present, changing directly down  by  any
                     number  of directories causes the current directory to be
                     overwritten.   For  example,  changing   from   ~pws   to
                     ~pws/some/other/dir  causes  ~pws  not  to be left on the
                     recent directory stack.   This  only  applies  to  direct
                     changes to descendant directories; earlier directories on
                     the list are not  pruned.   For  example,  changing  from
                     ~pws/yet/another  to  ~pws/some/other/dir  does not cause
                     ~pws to be pruned.

              pattern:pattern
                     Gives a zsh pattern for directories that  should  not  be
                     added  to  the  recent list (if not already there).  This
                     element can be repeated to add different  patterns.   For
                     example,  'pattern:/tmp(|/*)'  stops  /tmp or its descen-
                     dants from being  added.   The  EXTENDED_GLOB  option  is
                     always turned on for these patterns.

       recent-dirs-pushd
              If  set  to true, cdr will use pushd instead of cd to change the
              directory, so the directory is saved on the directory stack.  As
              the  directory  stack  is  completely  separate from the list of
              files saved by the mechanism used in this file there is no obvi-
              ous reason to do this.


   Use with dynamic directory naming
       It  is possible to refer to recent directories using the dynamic direc-
       tory name syntax by using the supplied function  zsh_directory_name_cdr
       a hook:

              autoload -Uz add-zsh-hook
              add-zsh-hook -Uz zsh_directory_name zsh_directory_name_cdr

       When  this  is done, ~[1] will refer to the most recent directory other
       than $PWD, and so on.  Completion after ~[...  also works.


   Details of directory handling
       This section is for the curious or confused; most users will  not  need
       to know this information.

       Recent  directories  are saved to a file immediately and hence are pre-
       served across sessions.  Note currently no file locking is applied: the
       list  is  updated  immediately on interactive commands and nowhere else
       (unlike history), and it is assumed you are only going to change direc-
       tory  in  one window at once.  This is not safe on shared accounts, but
       in any case the system has limited utility when someone else is  chang-
       ing to a different set of directories behind your back.

       To make this a little safer, only directory changes instituted from the
       command line, either directly  or  indirectly  through  shell  function
       calls  (but  not  through subshells, evals, traps, completion functions
       and the like) are saved.  Shell functions should use cd -q or pushd  -q
       to avoid side effects if the change to the directory is to be invisible
       at  the   command   line.    See   the   contents   of   the   function
       chpwd_recent_dirs for more details.


GATHERING INFORMATION FROM VERSION CONTROL SYSTEMS
       In  a  lot  of  cases, it is nice to automatically retrieve information
       from version control systems (VCSs), such as subversion, CVS or git, to
       be  able  to  provide it to the user; possibly in the user's prompt. So
       that you can instantly tell which branch  you  are  currently  on,  for
       example.

       In order to do that, you may use the vcs_info function.

       The following VCSs are supported, showing the abbreviated name by which
       they are referred to within the system:

              http://subversion.apache.org/
       SVK (svk)
              http://svk.bestpractical.com/

       There  is  also  support  for  the  patch   management   system   quilt
       (http://savannah.nongnu.org/projects/quilt).  See  Quilt  Support below
       for details.

       To load vcs_info:

              autoload -Uz vcs_info

       It can be used in any existing prompt, because it does not require  any
       specific $psvar entries to be available.


   Quickstart
       To  get this feature working quickly (including colors), you can do the
       following (assuming, you loaded vcs_info properly - see above):

              zstyle ':vcs_info:*' actionformats \
                  '%F{5}(%f%s%F{5})%F{3}-%F{5}[%F{2}%b%F{3}|%F{1}%a%F{5}]%f '
              zstyle ':vcs_info:*' formats       \
                  '%F{5}(%f%s%F{5})%F{3}-%F{5}[%F{2}%b%F{5}]%f '
              zstyle ':vcs_info:(sv[nk]|bzr):*' branchformat '%b%F{1}:%F{3}%r'
              precmd () { vcs_info }
              PS1='%F{5}[%F{2}%n%F{5}] %F{3}%3~ ${vcs_info_msg_0_}%f%# '

       Obviously, the last two lines are there for demonstration. You need  to
       call  vcs_info  from your precmd function. Once that is done you need a
       single quoted '${vcs_info_msg_0_}' in your prompt.

       To be able to use '${vcs_info_msg_0_}' directly  in  your  prompt  like
       this, you will need to have the PROMPT_SUBST option enabled.

       Now call the vcs_info_printsys utility from the command line:

              % vcs_info_printsys
              ## list of supported version control backends:
              ## disabled systems are prefixed by a hash sign (#)
              bzr
              cdv
              cvs
              darcs
              fossil
              git
              hg
              mtn
              p4
              svk
              svn
              tla
              ## flavours (cannot be used in the enable or disable styles; they
              ## are enabled and disabled with their master [git-svn -> git])
              ## they *can* be used in contexts: ':vcs_info:git-svn:*'.
              git-p4
              git-svn
              hg-git
              hg-hgsubversion
              hg-hgsvn

       You  may not want all of these because there is no point in running the
       code to detect systems you do not use.  So there is a  way  to  disable
       some backends altogether:

              zstyle ':vcs_info:*' disable bzr cdv darcs mtn svk tla

       You may also pick a few from that list and enable only those:

              zstyle ':vcs_info:*' enable git cvs svn

       If  you  rerun  vcs_info_printsys after one of these commands, you will
       see the backends listed in the disable style (or backends  not  in  the
       enable  style  -  if  you used that) marked as disabled by a hash sign.
       That means the detection of these systems  is  skipped  completely.  No
       wasted time there.


   Configuration
       The vcs_info feature can be configured via zstyle.

       First, the context in which we are working:
              :vcs_info:vcs-string:user-context:repo-root-name

       vcs-string
              is  one  of:  git, git-svn, git-p4, hg, hg-git, hg-hgsubversion,
              hg-hgsvn, darcs, bzr, cdv, mtn, svn, cvs, svk, tla, p4  or  fos-
              sil.  When hooks are active the hooks name is added after a `+'.
              (See Hooks in vcs_info below.)

       user-context
              is a freely configurable string, assignable by the user  as  the
              first argument to vcs_info (see its description below).

       repo-root-name
              is  the name of a repository in which you want a style to match.
              So, if you want a setting specific to  /usr/src/zsh,  with  that
              being  a CVS checkout, you can set repo-root-name to zsh to make
              it so.

       There are three special values  for  vcs-string:  The  first  is  named
       -init-,  that  is  in  effect as long as there was no decision what VCS
       backend to use. The second is -preinit-; it is used before vcs_info  is
       run,  when initializing the data exporting variables. The third special
       value is formats and is used by the vcs_info_lastmsg for looking up its
       styles.

       The  initial  value  of repo-root-name is -all- and it is replaced with
       the actual name, as soon as it is known. Only use this part of the con-
       text for defining the formats, actionformats or branchformat styles, as
       it is guaranteed that repo-root-name is  set  up  correctly  for  these
       only. For all other styles, just use '*' instead.

       There are two pre-defined values for user-context:
       default
              the one used if none is specified
       command
              used by vcs_info_lastmsg to lookup its styles

       You  can of course use ':vcs_info:*' to match all VCSs in all user-con-
       texts at once.

       This is a description of all styles that are looked up.

       formats
              A list of formats, used when actionformats is not used (which is
              most of the time).

       actionformats
              A list of formats, used if there is a special action going on in
              your current repository; like an interactive rebase or  a  merge
              conflict.

       branchformat
              Some backends replace %b in the formats and actionformats styles
              above, not only by a branch name but also by a revision  number.
              This style lets you modify how that string should look.

       nvcsformats
              These  "formats"  are  exported  when we didn't detect a version
              control system for the current directory or  vcs_info  was  dis-
              abled.  This  is  useful if you want vcs_info to completely take
              over the generation of your prompt. You would do something  like
              PS1='${vcs_info_msg_0_}' to accomplish that.

       hgrevformat
              hg  uses  both  a hash and a revision number to reference a spe-
              cific changeset in a repository. With this style you can  format
              the  revision  string  (see  branchformat)  to include either or
              both. It's only useful when get-revision is true. Note, the full
              40-character revision id is not available (except when using the
              use-simple option) because  executing  hg  more  than  once  per
              prompt is too slow; you may customize this behavior using hooks.

       max-exports
              Defines the maximum number of vcs_info_msg_*_ variables vcs_info
              will export.

       enable A  list  of backends you want to use. Checked in the -init- con-
              text. If this list contains an item called NONE  no  backend  is
              used  at all and vcs_info will do nothing. If this list contains
              ALL, vcs_info will use all known  backends.  Only  with  ALL  in
              enable  will the disable style have any effect. ALL and NONE are
              case insensitive.

       disable
              A list of VCSs you don't want vcs_info to test for  repositories
              (checked  in  the -init- context, too). Only used if enable con-
              tains ALL.

       disable-patterns
              A list of patterns that are checked against $PWD. If  a  pattern
              matches, vcs_info will be disabled. This style is checked in the
              :vcs_info:-init-:*:-all- context.

              Say, ~/.zsh is a directory under version control, in  which  you
              do not want vcs_info to be active, do:
                     zstyle ':vcs_info:*' disable-patterns "$HOME/.zsh(|/*)"

       use-quilt
              If  enabled,  the  quilt support code is active in `addon' mode.
              See Quilt Support for details.

       quilt-standalone
              If enabled, `standalone' mode detection is attempted if  no  VCS
              is active in a given directory. See Quilt Support for details.

       quilt-patch-dir
              Overwrite  the value of the $QUILT_PATCHES environment variable.
              See Quilt Support for details.

       quiltcommand
              When quilt itself is called in quilt support the value  of  this
              style is used as the command name.

       check-for-changes
              If  enabled,  this  style causes the %c and %u format escapes to
              show when the working directory  has  uncommitted  changes.  The
              strings  displayed  by  these  escapes can be controlled via the
              stagedstr and unstagedstr styles. The only  backends  that  cur-
              rently  support this option are git, hg, and bzr (the latter two
              only support unstaged).

              For this  style  to  be  evaluated  with  the  hg  backend,  the
              get-revision  style  needs  to  be  set and the use-simple style
              needs to be unset. The latter is the default; the former is not.

              With  the  bzr  backend,  lightweight  checkouts only honor this
              style if the use-server style is set.

              Note, the actions taken if this style is enabled are potentially
              expensive (read: they may be slow, depending on how big the cur-
              rent repository is).  Therefore, it is disabled by default.

       check-for-staged-changes
              This style is like check-for-changes, but it  never  checks  the
              worktree  files,  only  the metadata in the .${vcs} dir.  There-
              fore, this style initializes only the %c escape (with stagedstr)
              but   not   the   %u   escape.    This   style  is  faster  than
              check-for-changes.

              In the git backend, this style checks for changes in the  index.
              Other backends do not currently implement this style.

              This style is disabled by default.

       stagedstr
              This  string  will  be used in the %c escape if there are staged
              changes in the repository.

       unstagedstr
              This string will be used in the %u escape if there are  unstaged
              changes in the repository.

       command
              This  style  causes  vcs_info  to use the supplied string as the
              command to use as the VCS's binary. Note, that setting  this  in
              ':vcs_info:*' is not a good idea.

              If  the value of this style is empty (which is the default), the
              used binary name is the name of the backend in use (e.g. svn  is
              used in an svn repository).

              The  repo-root-name  part  in  the context is always the default
              -all- when this style is looked up.

              For example, this  style  can  be  used  to  use  binaries  from
              non-default  installation  directories. Assume, git is installed
              in /usr/bin but your  sysadmin  installed  a  newer  version  in
              /usr/local/bin.  Instead  of  changing  the  order of your $PATH
              parameter, you can do this:
                     zstyle ':vcs_info:git:*:-all-' command /usr/local/bin/git

       use-server
              This is used by the Perforce backend (p4) to decide if it should
              contact  the  Perforce server to find out if a directory is man-
              aged by Perforce.  This is the only reliable way of doing  this,
              but runs the risk of a delay if the server name cannot be found.
              If the server (more specifically, the host:port pair  describing
              the  server) cannot be contacted, its name is put into the asso-
              ciative array  vcs_info_p4_dead_servers  and  is  not  contacted
              again during the session until it is removed by hand.  If you do
              not set this style, the p4 backend is only usable  if  you  have
              set  the  environment  variable P4CONFIG to a file name and have
              corresponding files in the root  directories  of  each  Perforce
              client.   See  comments  in  the function VCS_INFO_detect_p4 for
              more detail.

              The Bazaar backend (bzr) uses  this  to  permit  contacting  the
              server  about  lightweight  checkouts, see the check-for-changes
              style.

       use-simple
              If there are two different ways of  gathering  information,  you
              can  select  the  simpler one by setting this style to true; the
              default is to use the not-that-simple code, which is potentially
              a  lot  slower but might be more accurate in all possible cases.
              This style is used by the bzr and hg backends. In the case of hg
              it  will invoke the external hexdump program to parse the binary
              dirstate cache file; this method will not return the local revi-
              sion number.

       get-revision
              If  set  to true, vcs_info goes the extra mile to figure out the
              revision of a repository's work tree (currently for the git  and
              hg  backends,  where  this  kind  of  information  is not always
              vital). For git, the hash value of  the  currently  checked  out
              commit  is  available  via  the %i expansion. With hg, the local
              revision number and the corresponding global hash are  available
              via %i.

       get-mq If  set  to true, the hg backend will look for a Mercurial Queue
              (mq) patch directory. Information will be available via the `%m'
              replacement.

       get-bookmarks
              If set to true, the hg backend will try to get a list of current
              bookmarks. They will be available via the `%m' replacement.

              The default is to generate a comma-separated list of  all  book-
              mark names that refer to the currently checked out revision.  If
              a bookmark is active, its  name  is  suffixed  an  asterisk  and
              placed first in the list.

       use-prompt-escapes
              Determines  if we assume that the assembled string from vcs_info
              includes prompt escapes. (Used by vcs_info_lastmsg.)

       debug  Enable debugging output to track  possible  problems.  Currently
              this style is only used by vcs_info's hooks system.

       hooks  A  list  style  that  defines  hook-function names. See Hooks in
              vcs_info below for details.

       patch-format
       nopatch-format
              This pair of styles format the patch information used by the  %m
              expando  in  formats  and actionformats for the git and hg back-
              ends.  The value is subject to  certain  %-expansions  described
              below.

       get-unapplied
              This  boolean style controls whether a backend should attempt to
              gather a list of unapplied patches (for example  with  Mercurial
              Queue patches).

              Used by the quilt and hg backends.

       The default values for these styles in all contexts are:

       actionformats

       get-unapplied
              false

       In  normal  formats  and  actionformats  the following replacements are
       done:

       %s     The VCS in use (git, hg, svn, etc.).
       %b     Information about the current branch.
       %a     An identifier that describes the action.  Only  makes  sense  in
              actionformats.
       %i     The  current revision number or identifier. For hg the hgrevfor-
              mat style may be used to customize the output.
       %c     The string from the stagedstr style if there are staged  changes
              in the repository.
       %u     The  string  from  the  unstagedstr  style if there are unstaged
              changes in the repository.
       %R     The base directory of the repository.
       %r     The repository name. If %R is /foo/bar/repoXY, %r is repoXY.
       %S     A   subdirectory   within   a    repository.    If    $PWD    is
              /foo/bar/repoXY/beer/tasty, %S is beer/tasty.
       %m     A  "misc" replacement. It is at the discretion of the backend to
              decide what this replacement expands to.

              The hg and git backends use this expando to display patch infor-
              mation.   hg  sources  patch information from the mq extensions;
              git from the rebase command and from the  and  stgit  extension.
              The patch-format and nopatch-format styles control the generated
              string.  The former is used when at least  one  patch  from  the
              patch queue has been applied, and the latter otherwise.

              The hg backend displays bookmark information in this expando (in
              addition to mq information).  See the get-mq  and  get-bookmarks
              styles.   Both  of these styles may be enabled at the same time.
              If both are enabled, both resulting strings will be shown  sepa-
              rated by a semicolon (that cannot currently be customized).

       In branchformat these replacements are done:

       %b     The branch name.
       %r     The current revision number or the hgrevformat style for hg.

       In hgrevformat these replacements are done:

       %r     The current local revision number.
       %h     The current global revision identifier.

       In patch-format and nopatch-format these replacements are done:

       %p     The name of the top-most applied patch (applied-string).
       %u     The number of unapplied patches (unapplied-string).
       %n     The number of applied patches.
       %c     The number of unapplied patches.
       %a     The number of all patches.
       %g     The names of active mq guards (hg backend).
       %G     The number of active mq guards (hg backend).

       Not  all VCS backends have to support all replacements. For nvcsformats
       no replacements are performed at all, it is just a string.


   Oddities
       If you want to use the %b (bold off) prompt expansion in formats, which
       expands  %b  itself, use %%b. That will cause the vcs_info expansion to
       replace %%b with %b, so that zsh's prompt expansion mechanism can  han-
       dle  it. Similarly, to hand down %b from branchformat, use %%%%b. Sorry
       for this inconvenience, but it cannot be easily avoided. Luckily we  do
       not  clash  with  a  lot of prompt expansions and this only needs to be
       done for those.


   Quilt Support
       Quilt is not a version control system, therefore  this  is  not  imple-
       mented  as a backend. It can help keeping track of a series of patches.
       People use it to keep a set of changes they want to use on top of soft-
       ware  packages  (which  is  tightly  integrated  into the package build
       process - the Debian project does this for a large number of packages).
       Quilt  can  also  help  individual  developers  keep track of their own
       patches on top of real version control systems.

       The vcs_info integration tries to support both ways of using  quilt  by
       having  two  slightly  different  modes  of operation: `addon' mode and
       `standalone' mode).

       For `addon' mode to become active vcs_info must have already detected a
       real  version  control system controlling the directory. If that is the
       case, a directory that holds quilt's patches needs to  be  found.  That
       directory is configurable via the `QUILT_PATCHES' environment variable.
       If that  variable  exists  its  value  is  used,  otherwise  the  value
       `patches'  is assumed. The value from $QUILT_PATCHES can be overwritten
       using the `quilt-patches' style. (Note: you can use  vcs_info  to  keep
       the  value  of  $QUILT_PATCHES  correct all the time via the post-quilt
       hook).

       When the directory in question is found, quilt is assumed to be active.
       To  gather  more  information,  vcs_info  looks  for a directory called
       `.pc'; Quilt uses that directory to track its current  state.  If  this
       directory  does  not  exist we know that quilt has not done anything to
       the working directory (read: no patches have been applied yet).

       If patches are applied, vcs_info will try to find  out  which.  If  you
       want to know which patches of a series are not yet applied, you need to
       activate the get-unapplied style in the appropriate context.

       vcs_info allows for very detailed control over how the gathered  infor-
       mation  is  presented  (see  the  below  sections,  Styles and Hooks in
       vcs_info), all of which are documented below. Note there are  a  number
       of  other  patch tracking systems that work on top of a certain version
       control system (like stgit for git, or mq for  hg);  the  configuration
       for  systems  like  that  are  generally configured the same way as the
       quilt support.

       If the quilt support is working in `addon' mode, the produced string is
       available  as a simple format replacement (%Q to be precise), which can
       be used in formats and actionformats; see below for details).

       If, on the other hand, the support  code  is  working  in  `standalone'
       mode,  vcs_info will pretend as if quilt were an actual version control
       system. That means that the version control  system  identifier  (which
       otherwise  would  be  something  like  `svn'  or  `cvs') will be set to
       `-quilt-'. This has implications on the used style context  where  this
       identifier is the second element. vcs_info will have filled in a proper
       value for the "repository's" root directory and the  string  containing
       the  information  about  quilt's  state will be available as the `misc'
       replacement (and %Q for compatibility with `addon' mode.

       What is left to discuss is  how  `standalone'  mode  is  detected.  The
       detection  itself is a series of searches for directories. You can have
       this detection enabled all the time in every directory that is not oth-
       erwise  under  version control. If you know there is only a limited set
       of trees where you would like vcs_info to try and  look  for  Quilt  in
       `standalone'  mode to minimise the amount of searching on every call to
       vcs_info, there are a number of ways to do that:

       Essentially, `standalone' mode  detection  is  controlled  by  a  style
       called  `quilt-standalone'. It is a string style and its value can have
       different effects. The simplest values are: `always' to  run  detection
       every  time  vcs_info  is  run,  and  `never' to turn the detection off
       entirely.

       If the value of quilt-standalone is something else, it  is  interpreted
       differently. If the value is the name of a scalar variable the value of
       that  variable  is  checked  and  that  value  is  used  in  the   same
       `always'/`never' way as described above.

       If  the  value  of  quilt-standalone  is an array, the elements of that
       array are used as directory names under which you want the detection to
       be active.

       If  quilt-standalone  is  an  associative  array, the keys are taken as
       directory names under which you want the detection to  be  active,  but
       only if the corresponding value is the string `true'.

       Last,  but not least, if the value of quilt-standalone is the name of a
       function, the function is called without arguments and the return value
       decides whether detection should be active. A `0' return value is true;
       a non-zero return value is interpreted as false.

       Note, if there is both a  function  and  a  variable  by  the  name  of
       quilt-standalone, the function will take precedence.


   Function Descriptions (Public API)
       vcs_info [user-context]
              The main function, that runs all backends and assembles all data
              into ${vcs_info_msg_*_}. This is the function you want  to  call
              from  precmd  if  you  want to include up-to-date information in
              your prompt (see Variable description below). If an argument  is
              given,  that  string  will  be  used  instead  of default in the
              user-context field of the style context.

       vcs_info_hookadd
              Statically registers a number of functions to a given hook.  The
              hook  needs to be given as the first argument; what follows is a
              list of hook-function names to register to the hook. The  `+vi-'
              prefix  needs  to  be left out here. See Hooks in vcs_info below
              for details.

       vcs_info_hookdel
              Remove hook-functions from a given hook. The hook  needs  to  be
              given  as  the first non-option argument; what follows is a list
              of hook-function names to un-register from the hook. If `-a'  is
              used as the first argument, all occurrences of the functions are
              unregistered. Otherwise only the last occurrence is removed  (if
              a function was registered to a hook more than once) . The `+vi-'
              prefix needs to be left out here. See Hooks  in  vcs_info  below
              for details.

       vcs_info_lastmsg
              Outputs  the  last ${vcs_info_msg_*_} value.  Takes into account
              the value of the  use-prompt-escapes  style  in  ':vcs_info:for-
              mats:command:-all-'. It also only prints max-exports values.

       vcs_info_printsys [user-context]
              Prints  a  list of all supported version control systems. Useful
              to find out possible contexts (and which of them are enabled) or
              values for the disable style.

       vcs_info_setsys
              Initializes vcs_info's internal list of available backends. With
              this function, you can add support for new VCSs without restart-
              ing the shell.

       All functions named VCS_INFO_* are for internal use only.


   Variable Description
       ${vcs_info_msg_N_}Note the trailing underscore.')
              (  Where N is an integer, e.g., vcs_info_msg_0_. These variables
              are the storage for the informational message the last  vcs_info
              call has assembled. These are strongly connected to the formats,
              actionformats and  nvcsformats  styles  described  above.  Those
              styles  are  lists.  The first member of that list gets expanded
              into ${vcs_info_msg_0_}, the second into ${vcs_info_msg_1_}  and
              the Nth into ${vcs_info_msg_N-1_}. These parameters are exported
              into the environment. (See the max-exports style above.)  )

       All variables named VCS_INFO_* are for internal use only.


   Hooks in vcs_info
       Hooks are places in vcs_info where you can run your own code. That code
       can  communicate  with the code that called it and through that, change
       the system's behaviour.

       For configuration, hooks change the style context:
              :vcs_info:vcs-string+hook-name:user-context:repo-root-name

       To register functions to a hook, you need to list  them  in  the  hooks
       style in the appropriate context.

       Example:
              zstyle ':vcs_info:*+foo:*' hooks bar baz

       This  registers  functions to the hook `foo' for all backends. In order
       to  avoid  namespace  problems,  all  registered  function  names   are
       prepended  by  a  `+vi-',  so the actual functions called for the `foo'
       hook are `+vi-bar' and `+vi-baz'.

       If you would like to register a function to a hook  regardless  of  the
       current context, you may use the vcs_info_hookadd function. To remove a
       function that was added like that, the vcs_info_hookdel function can be
       used.

       If  something  seems weird, you can enable the `debug' boolean style in
       the proper context and the hook-calling code will print what  it  tried
       to execute and whether the function in question existed.

       When  you  register more than one function to a hook, all functions are
       executed one after another until one function returns non-zero or until
       all  functions  have  been called. Context-sensitive hook functions are
       executed  before  statically  registered  ones  (the  ones   added   by
       vcs_info_hookadd).

       You   may  pass  data  between  functions  via  an  associative  array,
       user_data.  For example:
              +vi-git-myfirsthook(){
                  user_data[myval]=$myval
              }
              +vi-git-mysecondhook(){
                  # do something with ${user_data[myval]}
              }

       There are a number of variables that are special in hook contexts:

       ret    The return value that  the  hooks  system  will  return  to  the
              caller.  The  default is an integer `zero'. If and how a changed
              ret value changes the execution of the  caller  depends  on  the
              specific hook. See the hook documentation below for details.

       hook_com
              An  associated  array which is used for bidirectional communica-
              tion from the caller to hook functions. The used keys depend  on
              the specific hook.

       context
              The  active  context  of the hook. Functions that wish to change
              this variable should make it local scope first.

       vcs    The current VCS after it was detected. The same values as in the
              enable/disable  style  are  used.  Available in all hooks except
              start-up.

       Finally, the full list of currently available hooks:

       start-up
              Called after starting vcs_info but before the VCS in this direc-
              tory is determined. It can be used to deactivate vcs_info tempo-
              rarily if necessary. When ret is set to 1, vcs_info  aborts  and
              does  nothing;  when set to 2, vcs_info sets up everything as if
              no version control were active and exits.

       pre-get-data
              Same as start-up but after the VCS was detected.

       gen-hg-bookmark-string
              Called in the Mercurial backend when a bookmark string is gener-
              ated; the get-revision and get-bookmarks styles must be true.

              This  hook  gets  the  names  of  the  Mercurial  bookmarks that
              vcs_info collected from `hg'.

              If a bookmark is active, the key ${hook_com[hg-active-bookmark]}
              is set to its name.  The key is otherwise unset.

              When  setting ret to non-zero, the string in ${hook_com[hg-book-
              mark-string]} will be used in  the  %m  escape  in  formats  and
              actionformats  and  will be available in the global backend_misc
              array as ${backend_misc[bookmarks]}.

       gen-applied-string
              Called in the git (with stgit or during rebase),  and  hg  (with
              mq)  backends  and  in  quilt support when the applied-string is
              generated; the use-quilt zstyle must be true for quilt  (the  mq
              and stgit backends are active by default).

              This  hook  gets the names of all applied patches which vcs_info
              collected so far in the opposite order,  which  means  that  the
              first argument is the top-most patch and so forth.

              When    setting    ret    to    non-zero,    the    string    in
              ${hook_com[applied-string]} will be used in  the  %m  escape  in
              formats  and  actionformats;  it will be available in the global
              backend_misc array as $backend_misc[patches]}; and  it  will  be
              available as %p in the patch-format and nopatch-format styles.

       gen-unapplied-string
              Called  in  the  git (with stgit or during rebase), and hg (with
              mq) backend and in quilt support when  the  unapplied-string  is
              generated; the get-unapplied style must be true.

              This hook gets the names of all unapplied patches which vcs_info
              collected so far in the opposite  order,  which  mean  that  the
              first  argument  is  the patch next-in-line to be applied and so
              forth.

              When setting ret to non-zero,  the  string  in  ${hook_com[unap-
              plied-string]}  will  be available as %u in the patch-format and
              nopatch-format styles.

       gen-mqguards-string
              Called in the hg backend when guards-string  is  generated;  the
              get-mq style must be true (default).

              This hook gets the names of any active mq guards.

              When    setting    ret    to    non-zero,    the    string    in
              ${hook_com[guards-string]} will be used in the %g escape in  the
              patch-format and nopatch-format styles.

       no-vcs This  hooks  is  called  when  no  version  control  system  was
              detected.

              The `hook_com' parameter is not used.

       post-backend
              Called as soon as the backend has finished  collecting  informa-
              tion.

              The `hook_com' keys available are as for the set-message hook.

       post-quilt
              Called  after  the quilt support is done. The following informa-
              tion is passed as arguments to the hook:  1.  the  quilt-support
              mode  (`addon'  or `standalone'); 2. the directory that contains
              the patch series; 3. the directory  that  holds  quilt's  status
              information (the `.pc' directory) or the string "-nopc-" if that
              directory wasn't found.

              The `hook_com' parameter is not used.

       set-branch-format
              Called before `branchformat' is set. The only  argument  to  the
              hook is the format that is configured at this point.

              The  `hook_com'  keys  considered  are  `branch' and `revision'.
              They are set to the values figured out so far  by  vcs_info  and
              any  change will be used directly when the actual replacement is
              done.

              If    ret    is    set    to    non-zero,    the    string    in
              ${hook_com[branch-replace]}  will  be used unchanged as the `%b'
              replacement in the variables set by vcs_info.

       set-hgrev-format
              Called before a `hgrevformat' is set. The only argument  to  the
              hook is the format that is configured at this point.

              The  `hook_com' keys considered are `hash' and `localrev'.  They
              are set to the values figured out so far  by  vcs_info  and  any
              change  will  be  used  directly  when the actual replacement is
              done.

              If    ret    is    set    to    non-zero,    the    string    in
              ${hook_com[rev-replace]}  will  be  used  unchanged  as the `%i'
              replacement in the variables set by vcs_info.

       pre-addon-quilt
              This hook is used when vcs_info's quilt functionality is  active
              in  "addon"  mode  (quilt  used on top of a real version control
              system). It is activated right before any quilt specific  action
              is taken.

              Setting  the  `ret'  variable  in  this hook to a non-zero value
              avoids any quilt specific actions from being run at all.

       set-patch-format
              This hook is used to control some of the possible expansions  in
              patch-format  and nopatch-format styles with patch queue systems
              such as quilt, mqueue and the like.

              This hook is used in the git, hg and quilt backends.

              The hook allows the control of the %p (${hook_com[applied]}) and
              %u  (${hook_com[unapplied]})  expansion in all backends that use
              the   hook.    With    the    mercurial    backend,    the    %g
              (${hook_com[guards]})  expansion  is controllable in addition to
              that.

              If    ret    is    set    to    non-zero,    the    string    in
              ${hook_com[patch-replace]}  will be used unchanged instead of an
              expanded format from patch-format or nopatch-format.

       set-message
              Called each time before a `vcs_info_msg_N_' message is set.   It
              takes  two  arguments;  the  first  being the `N' in the message
              variable name, the second is the currently configured formats or
              actionformats.

              There  are  a  number  of  `hook_com'  keys, that are used here:
              `action', `branch',  `base',  `base-name',  `subdir',  `staged',
              `unstaged',  `revision', `misc', `vcs' and one `miscN' entry for
              each backend-specific data field (N starting at zero). They  are
              set  to the values figured out so far by vcs_info and any change
              will be used directly when the actual replacement is done.

              Since this hook is triggered multiple times (once for each  con-
              figured  formats  or actionformats), each of the `hook_com' keys
              mentioned above (except for the miscN entries)  has  an  `_orig'
              counterpart,  so  even if you changed a value to your liking you
              can still get the original value in the next run.  Changing  the
              `_orig' values is probably not a good idea.

              If  ret  is  set to non-zero, the string in ${hook_com[message]}
              will be used unchanged as the message by vcs_info.

       If all of this sounds rather confusing, take a  look  at  the  Examples
       section  below  and  also in the Misc/vcs_info-examples file in the Zsh
       source.  They contain some explanatory code.


   Examples
       Don't use vcs_info at all (even though it's in your prompt):
              zstyle ':vcs_info:*' enable NONE

       Disable the backends for bzr and svk:
              zstyle ':vcs_info:*' disable bzr svk

       Disable everything but bzr and svk:
              zstyle ':vcs_info:*' enable bzr svk

       Provide a special formats for git:
              zstyle ':vcs_info:git:*' formats       ' GIT, BABY! [%b]'
              zstyle ':vcs_info:git:*' actionformats ' GIT ACTION! [%b|%a]'

       All %x expansion in  all  sorts  of  formats  (formats,  actionformats,
       branchformat,  you  name  it) are done using the `zformat' builtin from
       the `zsh/zutil' module. That means you can do everything with these  %x
       items  what zformat supports. In particular, if you want something that
       is really long to have a fixed  width,  like  a  hash  in  a  mercurial
       branchformat, you can do this: %12.12i. That'll shrink the 40 character
       hash to its 12 leading characters. The form  is  actually  `%min.maxx'.
       More  is  possible.   See the section `The zsh/zutil Module' in zshmod-
       ules(1) for details.

       Use the quicker bzr backend
              zstyle ':vcs_info:bzr:*' use-simple true

       If   you   do   use   use-simple,   please   report    if    it    does
       `the-right-thing[tm]'.

       Display the revision number in yellow for bzr and svn:
              zstyle ':vcs_info:(svn|bzr):*' \
                     branchformat '%b%{'${fg[yellow]}'%}:%r'

       If you want colors, make sure you enclose the color codes in %{...%} if
       you want to use the string provided by vcs_info in prompts.

       Here is how to print the  VCS  information  as  a  command  (not  in  a
       prompt):
              alias vcsi='vcs_info command; vcs_info_lastmsg'

       This  way,  you  can  even  define  different  formats  for  output via
       vcs_info_lastmsg in the ':vcs_info:*:command:*' namespace.

       Now as promised, some code that uses hooks: say, you'd like to  replace
       the  string `svn' by `subversion' in vcs_info's %s formats replacement.

       First, we will tell vcs_info to call a  function  when  populating  the
       message variables with the gathered information:
              zstyle ':vcs_info:*+set-message:*' hooks svn2subversion

       Nothing happens. Which is reasonable, since we didn't define the actual
       function yet. To see what the hooks subsystem is trying to  do,  enable
       the `debug' style:
              zstyle ':vcs_info:*+*:*' debug true

       That  should give you an idea what is going on. Specifically, the func-
       tion that we are looking for is `+vi-svn2subversion'. Note, the  `+vi-'
       prefix.  So,  everything  is in order, just as documented. When you are
       done checking out the debugging output, disable it again:
              zstyle ':vcs_info:*+*:*' debug false

       Now, let's define the function:
              function +vi-svn2subversion() {
                  [[ ${hook_com[vcs_orig]} == svn ]] && hook_com[vcs]=subversion
              }

       Simple enough. And it could have even been simpler, if only we had reg-
       istered our function in a less generic context. If we do it only in the
       `svn' backend's context, we don't need to test which the active backend
       is:
              zstyle ':vcs_info:svn+set-message:*' hooks svn2subversion
              function +vi-svn2subversion() {
                  hook_com[vcs]=subversion
              }

       And finally a little more elaborate example, that uses a hook to create
       a customised bookmark string for the hg backend.

       Again, we start off by registering a function:
              zstyle ':vcs_info:hg+gen-hg-bookmark-string:*' hooks hgbookmarks

       And then we define the `+vi-hgbookmarks function:
              function +vi-hgbookmarks() {
                  # The default is to connect all bookmark names by
                  # commas. This mixes things up a little.
                  # Imagine, there's one type of bookmarks that is
                  # special to you. Say, because it's *your* work.
                  # Those bookmarks look always like this: "sh/*"
                  # (because your initials are sh, for example).
                  # This makes the bookmarks string use only those
                  # bookmarks. If there's more than one, it
                  # concatenates them using commas.
                  # The bookmarks returned by `hg' are available in
                  # the function's positional parameters.
                  local s="${(Mj:,:)@:#sh/*}"
                  # Now, the communication with the code that calls
                  # the hook functions is done via the hook_com[]
                  # hash. The key at which the `gen-hg-bookmark-string'
                  # hook looks is `hg-bookmark-string'. So:
                  hook_com[hg-bookmark-string]=$s
                  # And to signal that we want to use the string we
                  # just generated, set the special variable `ret' to
                  # something other than the default zero:
                  ret=1
                  return 0
              }

       Some longer examples and code snippets which might be useful are avail-
       able  in the examples file located at Misc/vcs_info-examples in the Zsh
       source directory.

       This concludes our guided tour through zsh's vcs_info.


PROMPT THEMES
   Installation
       You should make sure  all  the  functions  from  the  Functions/Prompts
       directory of the source distribution are available; they all begin with
       the string `prompt_' except for the special function`promptinit'.   You
       also  need  the  `colors'  function  from Functions/Misc.  All of these
       functions may already have been installed on your system; if  not,  you
       will  need  to find them and copy them.  The directory should appear as
       one of the elements of the fpath array (this should already be the case
       if they were installed), and at least the function promptinit should be
       autoloaded; it will autoload the rest.  Finally, to initialize the  use
       of  the system you need to call the promptinit function.  The following
       code in your .zshrc will arrange for this;  assume  the  functions  are
       stored in the directory ~/myfns:

              fpath=(~/myfns $fpath)
              autoload -U promptinit
              promptinit


   Theme Selection
       Use  the  prompt  command to select your preferred theme.  This command
       may be added to your .zshrc following the call to promptinit  in  order
       to start zsh with a theme already selected.

       prompt [ -c | -l ]
       prompt [ -p | -h ] [ theme ... ]
       prompt [ -s ] theme [ arg ... ]
              Set  or  examine  the prompt theme.  With no options and a theme
              argument, the theme with that name is set as the current  theme.
              The  available  themes  are  determined  at run time; use the -l
              option to see a list.  The special  theme  `random'  selects  at
              random one of the available themes and sets your prompt to that.

              In some cases the theme may be modified by  one  or  more  argu-
              ments, which should be given after the theme name.  See the help
              for each theme for descriptions of these arguments.

              Options are:

              -c     Show the currently selected theme and its parameters,  if
                     any.
              -l     List all available prompt themes.
              -p     Preview  the  theme  named  by theme, or all themes if no
                     theme is given.
              -h     Show help for the theme named by theme, or for the prompt
                     function if no theme is given.
              -s     Set theme as the current theme and save state.

       prompt_theme_setup
              Each available theme has a setup function which is called by the
              prompt function to install that theme.  This function may define
              other  functions  as necessary to maintain the prompt, including
              functions used to preview the prompt or  provide  help  for  its
              use.   You  should  not  normally  call a theme's setup function
              directly.


ZLE FUNCTIONS
   Widgets
       These functions all implement user-defined ZLE widgets (see  zshzle(1))
       which  can  be bound to keystrokes in interactive shells.  To use them,
       your .zshrc should contain lines of the form

              autoload function
              zle -N function

       followed by an appropriate bindkey command to  associate  the  function
       with a key sequence.  Suggested bindings are described below.

       bash-style word functions
              If  you  are  looking for functions to implement moving over and
              editing words in the manner of  bash,  where  only  alphanumeric
              characters are considered word characters, you can use the func-
              tions described in the next section.  The  following  is  suffi-
              cient:

                     autoload -U select-word-style
                     select-word-style bash


       forward-word-match, backward-word-match
       kill-word-match, backward-kill-word-match
       transpose-words-match, capitalize-word-match
       up-case-word-match, down-case-word-match
       select-word-style, match-word-context, match-words-by-style
              The  eight  `-match'  functions are drop-in replacements for the
              builtin widgets without the suffix.  By default they behave in a
              similar  way.   However,  by  the use of styles and the function
              select-word-style, the way words are matched can be altered.

              The  simplest  way  of  configuring  the  functions  is  to  use
              select-word-style,  which can either be called as a normal func-
              tion with the appropriate argument, or invoked as a user-defined
              widget  that  will  prompt  for  the first character of the word
              style to be used.  The first  time  it  is  invoked,  the  eight
              -match  functions  will  automatically  replace the builtin ver-
              sions, so they do not need to be loaded explicitly.

              The word styles available are as follows.  Only the first  char-
              acter is examined.

              bash   Word characters are alphanumeric characters only.

              normal As  in  normal  shell  operation:   word  characters  are
                     alphanumeric characters plus any  characters  present  in
                     the string given by the parameter $WORDCHARS.

              shell  Words  are  complete  shell  command  arguments, possibly
                     including complete quoted strings, or any tokens  special
                     to the shell.

              whitespace
                     Words  are any set of characters delimited by whitespace.

              default
                     Restore the default settings; this is usually the same as
                     `normal'.

              All but `default' can be input as an upper case character, which
              has the same effect but with subword  matching  turned  on.   In
              this  case,  words  with  upper case characters are treated spe-
              cially: each separate run of upper case characters, or an  upper
              case  character  followed  by any number of other characters, is
              considered a word.  The style subword-range can supply an alter-
              native  character range to the default `[:upper:]'; the value of
              the style is treated as the contents of a `[...]' pattern  (note
              that  the outer brackets should not be supplied, only those sur-
              rounding named ranges).

              More control can  be  obtained  using  the  zstyle  command,  as
              described in zshmodules(1).  Each style is looked up in the con-
              text :zle:widget where widget is the name  of  the  user-defined
              widget,  not the name of the function implementing it, so in the
              case of the definitions supplied by select-word-style the appro-
              priate  contexts are :zle:forward-word, and so on.  The function
              select-word-style itself always defines styles for  the  context
              `:zle:*'  which can be overridden by more specific (longer) pat-
              terns as well as explicit contexts.

              The style word-style specifies the rules to use.  This may  have
              the following values.

              normal Use  the  standard  shell  rules,  i.e. alphanumerics and
                     $WORDCHARS, unless overridden by the styles word-chars or
                     word-class.

              specified
                     Similar to normal, but only the specified characters, and
                     not also alphanumerics, are considered word characters.

              unspecified
                     The negation of  specified.   The  given  characters  are
                     those which will not be considered part of a word.

              shell  Words  are obtained by using the syntactic rules for gen-
                     erating shell command arguments.   In  addition,  special
                     tokens which are never command arguments such as `()' are
                     also treated as words.

              whitespace
                     Words are whitespace-delimited strings of characters.

              The first three of those rules usually use $WORDCHARS,  but  the
              value   in   the  parameter  can  be  overridden  by  the  style
              word-chars, which works in exactly the same way  as  $WORDCHARS.
              In addition, the style word-class uses character class syntax to
              group characters and takes precedence over  word-chars  if  both
              are  set.  The word-class style does not include the surrounding
              brackets of the character class; for example, `-:[:alnum:]' is a
              valid  word-class  to include all alphanumerics plus the charac-
              ters `-' and `:'.  Be careful including  `]',  `^'  and  `-'  as
              these are special inside character classes.

              word-style  may  also  have  `-subword' appended to its value to
              turn on subword matching, as described above.

              The style skip-chars is mostly useful  for  transpose-words  and
              similar  functions.   If  set,  it  gives  a count of characters
              starting at the cursor position which  will  not  be  considered
              part  of  the  word and are treated as space, regardless of what
              they actually are.  For example, if

                     zstyle ':zle:transpose-words' skip-chars 1

              has been set, and transpose-words-match is called with the  cur-
              sor  on the X of fooXbar, where X can be any character, then the
              resulting expression is barXfoo.

              Finer grained control can  be  obtained  by  setting  the  style
              word-context  to  an  array  of  pairs of entries.  Each pair of
              entries consists of a pattern and a subcontext.  The shell argu-
              ment  the  cursor  is on is matched against each pattern in turn
              until one matches; if it does, the  context  is  extended  by  a
              colon  and  the corresponding subcontext.  Note that the test is
              made against the original word on the line, with no stripping of
              quotes.   Special  handling  is  done between words: the current
              context is examined and if it contains the string back, the word
              before  the  cursor is considered, else the word after cursor is
              considered. Some examples are given below.

              The style skip-whitespace-first  is  only  used  with  the  for-
              ward-word widget.  If it is set to true, then forward-word skips
              any non-word-characters, followed  by  any  non-word-characters:
              this  is  similar to the behaviour of other word-orientated wid-
              gets, and also that used by other editors,  however  it  differs
              from  the  standard zsh behaviour.  When using select-word-style
              the widget is set in the context :zle:*  to  true  if  the  word
              style is bash and false otherwise.  It may be overridden by set-
              ting it in the more specific context :zle:forward-word*.

              Here are some examples of use of the styles, actually taken from
              the simplified interface in select-word-style:

                     zstyle ':zle:*' word-style standard
                     zstyle ':zle:*' word-chars ''

              Implements  bash-style  word handling for all widgets, i.e. only
              alphanumerics are word characters;  equivalent  to  setting  the
              parameter WORDCHARS empty for the given context.

                     style ':zle:*kill*' word-style space

              Uses  space-delimited  words for widgets with the word `kill' in
              the name.  Neither of the styles word-chars  nor  word-class  is
              used in this case.

              Here  are  some  examples  of  use  of the word-context style to
              extend the context.

                     zstyle ':zle:*' word-context \
                            "*/*" file "[[:space:]]" whitespace
                     zstyle ':zle:transpose-words:whitespace' word-style shell
                     zstyle ':zle:transpose-words:filename' word-style normal
                     zstyle ':zle:transpose-words:filename' word-chars ''

              This  provides  two  different  ways  of  using  transpose-words
              depending  on  whether the cursor is on whitespace between words
              or on a filename, here any word containing a /.  On  whitespace,
              complete  arguments  as  defined by standard shell rules will be
              transposed.  In a filename, only alphanumerics  will  be  trans-
              posed.   Elsewhere,  words  will be transposed using the default
              style for :zle:transpose-words.

              The word matching and all the handling  of  zstyle  settings  is
              actually implemented by the function match-words-by-style.  This
              can be used to create new  user-defined  widgets.   The  calling
              function  should set the local parameter curcontext to :zle:wid-
              get,  create  the  local  parameter   matched_words   and   call
              match-words-by-style    with    no    arguments.    On   return,
              matched_words will be set to an array with the elements: (1) the
              start  of  the  line  (2)  the  word  before  the cursor (3) any
              non-word characters between that word and  the  cursor  (4)  any
              non-word  character  at  the  cursor position plus any remaining
              non-word characters before the next word, including all  charac-
              ters  specified by the skip-chars style, (5) the word at or fol-
              lowing the cursor (6) any  non-word  characters  following  that
              word  (7) the remainder of the line.  Any of the elements may be
              an empty string; the calling function should test  for  this  to
              decide whether it can perform its function.

              It   is   possible   to   pass   options   with   arguments   to
              match-words-by-style to override the use of styles.  The options
              are:
              -w     word-style
              -s     skip-chars
              -c     word-class
              -C     word-chars
              -r     subword-range

              For  example,  match-words-by-style -w shell -c 0 may be used to
              extract the command argument around the cursor.

              The  word-context  style  is   implemented   by   the   function
              match-word-context.   This  should not usually need to be called
              directly.

       copy-earlier-word
              This widget works like a  combination  of  insert-last-word  and
              copy-prev-shell-word.    Repeated   invocations  of  the  widget
              retrieve earlier words on the relevant  history  line.   With  a
              numeric argument N, insert the Nth word from the history line; N
              may be negative to count from the end of the line.

              If insert-last-word has been used to retrieve the last word on a
              previous  history  line,  repeated invocations will replace that
              word with earlier words from the same line.

              Otherwise, the widget applies to words  on  the  line  currently
              being  edited.   The  widget  style  can  be  set to the name of
              another widget that should be called to  retrieve  words.   This
              widget must accept the same three arguments as insert-last-word.

       cycle-completion-positions
              After inserting an unambiguous string into the command line, the
              new  function  based  completion  system may know about multiple
              places in this string where characters  are  missing  or  differ
              from  at  least one of the possible matches.  It will then place
              the cursor on the position it considers to be the most interest-
              ing one, i.e. the one where one can disambiguate between as many
              matches as possible with as little typing as possible.

              This widget allows the cursor to be easily moved  to  the  other
              interesting  spots.   It  can  be  invoked  repeatedly  to cycle
              between all positions reported by the completion system.

       delete-whole-word-match
              This is another function which works like the  -match  functions
              described  immediately  above,  i.e.  using styles to decide the
              word boundaries.  However, it  is  not  a  replacement  for  any
              existing function.

              The  basic  behaviour  is  to delete the word around the cursor.
              There is no numeric argument  handling;  only  the  single  word
              around  the  cursor  is  considered.  If the widget contains the
              string kill, the removed text will be placed  in  the  cutbuffer
              for   future   yanking.    This  can  be  obtained  by  defining
              kill-whole-word-match as follows:

                     zle -N kill-whole-word-match delete-whole-word-match

              and then binding the widget kill-whole-word-match.

       up-line-or-beginning-search, down-line-or-beginning-search
              These   widgets   are   similar   to   the   builtin   functions
              up-line-or-search  and  down-line-or-search:   if in a multiline
              buffer they move up or down within the  buffer,  otherwise  they
              search  for  a  history  line  matching the start of the current
              line.  In this case, however,  they  search  for  a  line  which
              matches  the  current line up to the current cursor position, in
              the manner of  history-beginning-search-backward  and  -forward,
              rather than the first word on the line.

       edit-command-line
              Edit the command line using your visual editor, as in ksh.

                     bindkey -M vicmd v edit-command-line

       expand-absolute-path
              Expand  the  file  name  under  the  cursor to an absolute path,
              resolving symbolic links.  Where possible, the initial path seg-
              ment  is  turned into a named directory or reference to a user's
              home directory.

       history-search-end
              This   function   implements    the    widgets    history-begin-
              ning-search-backward-end    and    history-beginning-search-for-
              ward-end.  These commands work by first calling the  correspond-
              ing builtin widget (see `History Control' in zshzle(1)) and then
              moving the cursor to the end of the line.  The  original  cursor
              position  is  remembered and restored before calling the builtin
              widget a second time, so that the same  search  is  repeated  to
              look farther through the history.

              Although  you autoload only one function, the commands to use it
              are slightly different because it implements two widgets.

                     zle -N history-beginning-search-backward-end \
                            history-search-end
                     zle -N history-beginning-search-forward-end \
                            history-search-end
                     bindkey '\e^P' history-beginning-search-backward-end
                     bindkey '\e^N' history-beginning-search-forward-end

       history-beginning-search-menu
              This function implements yet another form of history  searching.
              The text before the cursor is used to select lines from the his-
              tory, as for history-beginning-search-backward except  that  all
              matches  are  shown  in a numbered menu.  Typing the appropriate
              digits inserts the full history line.  Note that leading  zeroes
              must  be  typed (they are only shown when necessary for removing
              ambiguity).  The entire history is searched; there  is  no  dis-
              tinction between forwards and backwards.

              With a numeric argument, the search is not anchored to the start
              of the line; the string typed by the use may appear anywhere  in
              the line in the history.

              If  the  widget  name contains `-end' the cursor is moved to the
              end of the line inserted.  If the widget name contains  `-space'
              any  space  in  the  text typed is treated as a wildcard and can
              match anything (hence a leading space is equivalent to giving  a
              numeric argument).  Both forms can be combined, for example:

                     zle -N history-beginning-search-menu-space-end \
                            history-beginning-search-menu

       history-pattern-search
              The  function  history-pattern-search  implements  widgets which
              prompt for a pattern with which to search the history  backwards
              or  forwards.   The  pattern is in the usual zsh format, however
              the first character may be ^ to anchor the search to  the  start
              of  the  line,  and  the  last  character may be $ to anchor the
              search to the end of the line.  If the search was  not  anchored
              to  the  end of the line the cursor is positioned just after the
              pattern found.

              The commands to create bindable widgets are similar to those  in
              the example immediately above:

                     autoload -U history-pattern-search
                     zle -N history-pattern-search-backward history-pattern-search
                     zle -N history-pattern-search-forward history-pattern-search

       incarg Typing  the keystrokes for this widget with the cursor placed on
              or to the left of an integer causes that integer  to  be  incre-
              mented  by  one.   With a numeric argument, the number is incre-
              mented by the amount of the argument (decremented if the numeric
              argument is negative).  The shell parameter incarg may be set to
              change the default increment to something other than one.

                     bindkey '^X+' incarg

       incremental-complete-word
              This allows incremental completion of a  word.   After  starting
              this  command,  a  list of completion choices can be shown after
              every character you type, which you can delete with ^H  or  DEL.
              Pressing return accepts the completion so far and returns you to
              normal editing (that is, the command  line  is  not  immediately
              executed).  You can hit TAB to do normal completion, ^G to abort
              back to the state when you started, and ^D to list the  matches.

              This works only with the new function based completion system.

                     bindkey '^Xi' incremental-complete-word

       insert-composed-char
              This function allows you to compose characters that don't appear
              on the keyboard to be inserted into the command line.  The  com-
              mand  is  followed by two keys corresponding to ASCII characters
              (there is no prompt).  For accented characters, the two keys are
              a  base  character  followed by a code for the accent, while for
              other special characters the  two  characters  together  form  a
              mnemonic  for  the  character to be inserted.  The two-character
              codes are a subset of those given by RFC 1345 (see  for  example
              http://www.faqs.org/rfcs/rfc1345.html).

              The  function may optionally be followed by up to two characters
              which replace one or both of the characters read from  the  key-
              board;  if  both characters are supplied, no input is read.  For
              example, insert-composed-char a: can be used within a widget  to
              insert  an  a  with  umlaut into the command line.  This has the
              advantages over use of a literal character that it is more  por-
              table.

              For  best  results  zsh  should have been built with support for
              multibyte characters (configured with --enable-multibyte);  how-
              ever,  the  function  works  for the limited range of characters
              available in single-byte character sets such as ISO-8859-1.

              The character is converted into  the  local  representation  and
              inserted  into  the  command  line at the cursor position.  (The
              conversion is done within the shell, using  whatever  facilities
              the C library provides.)  With a numeric argument, the character
              and its code are previewed in the status line

              The function may be run outside zle in which case it prints  the
              character  (together  with a newline) to standard output.  Input
              is still read from keystrokes.

              See insert-unicode-char for an alternative way of inserting Uni-
              code characters using their hexadecimal character number.

              The set of accented characters is reasonably complete up to Uni-
              code character U+0180, the set of special  characters  less  so.
              However,  it is very sporadic from that point.  Adding new char-
              acters is easy, however; see the function define-composed-chars.

              The codes for the second character when used to accent the first
              are as follows.  Note that not every character  can  take  every
              accent.

              The  most common characters from the Arabic, Cyrillic, Greek and
              Hebrew alphabets are available; consult RFC 1345 for the  appro-
              priate sequences.  In addition, a set of two letter codes not in
              RFC 1345 are available for the  double-width  characters  corre-
              sponding to ASCII characters from !  to ~ (0x21 to 0x7e) by pre-
              ceding the character with ^, for example ^A for  a  double-width
              A.

              This  function  allows  you  type  a  file  pattern, and see the
              results of the expansion at each step.  When you hit return, all
              expansions are inserted into the command line.

       insert-unicode-char
              When  first  executed, the user inputs a set of hexadecimal dig-
              its.  This  is  terminated  with  another  call  to  insert-uni-
              code-char.   The  digits  are then turned into the corresponding
              Unicode character.  For example, if the widget is bound to  ^XU,
              the character sequence `^XU 4 c ^XU' inserts L (Unicode U+004c).

              See insert-composed-char for a way of inserting characters using
              a two-character mnemonic.


       narrow-to-region [ -p pre ] [ -P post ]
                        [ -S statepm | -R statepm ] [ -n ] [ start end ]
       narrow-to-region-invisible
              Narrow  the editable portion of the buffer to the region between
              the cursor and the mark, which may  be  in  either  order.   The
              region may not be empty.

              narrow-to-region may be used as a widget or called as a function
              from a user-defined widget; by default,  the  text  outside  the
              editable  area  remains  visible.  A recursive-edit is performed
              and the original widening  status  is  then  restored.   Various
              options and arguments are available when it is called as a func-
              tion.

              The options -p pretext and -P posttext may be  used  to  replace
              the  text  before  and after the display for the duration of the
              function; either or both may be an empty string.

              If the option -n is also given, pretext or posttext will only be
              inserted  if  there  is  text before or after the region respec-
              tively which will be made invisible.

              Two numeric arguments may be given which will be used instead of
              the cursor and mark positions.

              The  option  -S statepm is used to narrow according to the other
              options while saving the original state in  the  parameter  with
              name statepm, while the option -R statepm is used to restore the
              state from the parameter; note in both cases  the  name  of  the
              parameter  is  required.   In the second case, other options and
              arguments are irrelevant.  When this method is used,  no  recur-
              sive-edit  is  performed;  the  calling  widget should call this
              function with the option -S, perform its own editing on the com-
              mand  line or pass control to the user via `zle recursive-edit',
              then call this  function  with  the  option  -R.   The  argument
              statepm  must  be  a  suitable  name  for an ordinary parameter,
              except that parameters  beginning  with  the  prefix  _ntr_  are
              reserved for use within narrow-to-region.  Typically the parame-
              ter will be local to the calling function.

              narrow-to-region-invisible is a simple widget which  calls  nar-
              row-to-region  with arguments which replace any text outside the
              region with `...'.

              The display is restored (and the widget returns)  upon  any  zle
              command  which  would  usually  cause the line to be accepted or
              aborted.  Hence an additional such command is required to accept
              or abort the current line.

              The  return  status  of  both  widgets  is  zero if the line was
              accepted, else non-zero.

              Here is a trivial example of a widget using this feature.
                     local state
                     narrow-to-region -p $'Editing restricted region\n' \
                       -P '' -S state
                     zle recursive-edit
                     narrow-to-region -R state

       predict-on
              This set of functions implements predictive typing using history
              search.   After  predict-on, typing characters causes the editor
              to look backward in the history for  the  first  line  beginning
              with  what  you  have  typed so far.  After predict-off, editing
              returns to normal for the line found.  In fact, you often  don't
              even  need to use predict-off, because if the line doesn't match
              something in the history, adding a key performs standard comple-
              tion,  and  then  inserts  itself  if no completions were found.
              However, editing in the middle of a line is  liable  to  confuse
              prediction; see the toggle style below.

              With  the  function based completion system (which is needed for
              this), you should be able to type TAB at  almost  any  point  to
              advance  the  cursor to the next ``interesting'' character posi-
              tion (usually the end of the current word, but  sometimes  some-
              where  in the middle of the word).  And of course as soon as the
              entire line is what you want, you can accept with return,  with-
              out needing to move the cursor to the end first.

              The first time predict-on is used, it creates several additional
              widget functions:

              delete-backward-and-predict
                     Replaces the backward-delete-char  widget.   You  do  not
                     need to bind this yourself.
              insert-and-predict
                     Implements predictive typing by replacing the self-insert
                     widget.  You do not need to bind this yourself.
              predict-off
                     Turns off predictive typing.

              Although you autoload only the predict-on function, it is neces-
              sary to create a keybinding for predict-off as well.

                     zle -N predict-on
                     zle -N predict-off
                     bindkey '^X^Z' predict-on
                     bindkey '^Z' predict-off

       read-from-minibuffer
              This is most useful when called as a function from inside a wid-
              get, but will work correctly as a widget in its own  right.   It
              prompts  for a value below the current command line; a value may
              be input using all of  the  standard  zle  operations  (and  not
              merely the restricted set available when executing, for example,
              execute-named-cmd).  The value is then returned to  the  calling
              function in the parameter $REPLY and the editing buffer restored
              to its previous state.  If the read was aborted  by  a  keyboard
              break  (typically  ^G), the function returns status 1 and $REPLY
              is not set.

              If one argument is supplied to the function it  is  taken  as  a
              prompt,  otherwise `? ' is used.  If two arguments are supplied,
              they are the prompt and the initial value of $LBUFFER, and if  a
              third  argument  is  given  it is the initial value of $RBUFFER.
              This provides a default value  and  starting  cursor  placement.
              Upon return the entire buffer is the value of $REPLY.

              One  option is available: `-k num' specifies that num characters
              are to be read instead of a whole line.  The line editor is  not
              invoked  recursively  in this case, so depending on the terminal
              settings the input may not be visible, and only the  input  keys
              are  placed  in $REPLY, not the entire buffer.  Note that unlike
              the read builtin num must be given; there is no default.

              The name is a slight  misnomer,  as  in  fact  the  shell's  own
              minibuffer is not used.  Hence it is still possible to call exe-
              cuted-named-cmd and similar functions while reading a value.

       replace-argument, replace-argument-edit
              The function replace-argument can be used to replace  a  command
              line  argument  in  the  current command line or, if the current
              command line is empty, in the last command  line  executed  (the
              new  command  line is not executed).  Arguments are as delimited
              by standard shell syntax,

              If a numeric argument is given, that specifies the  argument  to
              be replaced.  0 means the command name, as in history expansion.
              A negative numeric argument counts backward from the last  word.

              If  no  numeric  argument  is  given,  the  current  argument is
              replaced; this is the last argument if the previous history line
              is being used.

              The function prompts for a replacement argument.

              If  the  widget contains the string edit, for example is defined
              as

                     zle -N replace-argument-edit replace-argument

              then the function presents the current value of the argument for
              editing,  otherwise  the  editing  buffer for the replacement is
              initially empty.

       replace-string, replace-pattern
       replace-string-again, replace-pattern-again
              The  function  replace-string  implements  three  widgets.    If
              defined  under the same name as the function, it prompts for two
              strings; the first (source) string will be replaced by the  sec-
              ond everywhere it occurs in the line editing buffer.

              If  the  widget name contains the word `pattern', for example by
              defining the widget using the command  `zle  -N  replace-pattern
              replace-string',  then  the matching is performed using zsh pat-
              terns.  All zsh extended globbing patterns can be  used  in  the
              source  string; note that unlike filename generation the pattern
              does not need to match an entire word, nor  do  glob  qualifiers
              have  any  effect.  In addition, the replacement string can con-
              tain parameter or command substitutions.  Furthermore, a `&'  in
              the  replacement string will be replaced with the matched source
              string, and a backquoted digit `\N' will be replaced by the  Nth
              parenthesised  expression  matched.  The form `\{N}' may be used
              to protect the digit from following digits.

              If the widget instead contains the word `regex'  (or  `regexp'),
              then  the  matching  is  performed  using  regular  expressions,
              respecting the setting of  the  option  RE_MATCH_PCRE  (see  the
              description  of the function regexp-replace below).  The special
              replacement facilities described above for pattern matching  are
              available.

              By default the previous source or replacement string will not be
              offered for editing.  However, this feature can be activated  by
              setting  the style edit-previous in the context :zle:widget (for
              example, :zle:replace-string) to true.  In addition, a  positive
              numeric  argument  forces  the  previous values to be offered, a
              negative or zero argument forces them not to be.

              The function replace-string-again can be used to repeat the pre-
              vious    replacement;   no   prompting   is   done.    As   with
              replace-string, if the name of  the  widget  contains  the  word
              `pattern'  or `regex', pattern or regular expression matching is
              performed, else a literal string  replacement.   Note  that  the
              previous  source  and replacement text are the same whether pat-
              tern, regular expression or string matching is used.

              In addition, replace-string shows the previous replacement above
              the prompt, so long as there was one during the current session;
              if the source string is empty, that replacement will be repeated
              without the widget prompting for a replacement string.

              For example, starting from the line:

                     print This line contains fan and fond

              and  invoking replace-pattern with the source string `f(?)n' and
              the replacement string `c\1r' produces the not very useful line:

                     print This line contains car and cord

              The  range of the replacement string can be limited by using the
              narrow-to-region-invisible widget.  One limitation of  the  cur-
              rent  version  is  that  undo  will cycle through changes to the
              replacement and source strings before  undoing  the  replacement
              itself.

       send-invisible
              This is similar to read-from-minibuffer in that it may be called
              as a function from a widget or as  a  widget  of  its  own,  and
              interactively reads input from the keyboard.  However, the input
              being typed is concealed and a  string  of  asterisks  (`*')  is
              shown  instead.   The value is saved in the parameter $INVISIBLE
              to which a reference is inserted into the editing buffer at  the
              restored cursor position.  If the read was aborted by a keyboard
              break (typically ^G) or another  escape  from  editing  such  as
              push-line, $INVISIBLE is set to empty and the original buffer is
              restored unchanged.

              If one argument is supplied to the function it  is  taken  as  a
              prompt, otherwise `Non-echoed text: ' is used (as in emacs).  If
              a second and third argument are supplied they are used to  begin
              and  end  the  reference to $INVISIBLE that is inserted into the
              buffer.  The default is to open with  ${,  then  INVISIBLE,  and
              close with }, but many other effects are possible.

       smart-insert-last-word
              This function may replace the insert-last-word widget, like so:

                     zle -N insert-last-word smart-insert-last-word

              With  a  numeric argument, or when passed command line arguments
              in a call from another widget, it behaves like insert-last-word,
              except  that words in comments are ignored when INTERACTIVE_COM-
              MENTS is set.

              Otherwise, the rightmost ``interesting'' word from the  previous
              command  is  found  and  inserted.   The  default  definition of
              ``interesting'' is that the word contains at  least  one  alpha-
              betic  character,  slash,  or backslash.  This definition may be
              overridden by use of the match style.  The context used to  look
              up  the  style  is  the  widget  name, so usually the context is
              :insert-last-word.  However, you can bind this function to  dif-
              ferent widgets to use different patterns:

                     zle -N insert-last-assignment smart-insert-last-word
                     zstyle :insert-last-assignment match '[[:alpha:]][][[:alnum:]]#=*'
                     bindkey '\e=' insert-last-assignment

              If  no  interesting word is found and the auto-previous style is
              set to a true value, the search  continues  upward  through  the
              history.   When  auto-previous  is unset or false (the default),
              the widget must be invoked repeatedly in order to search earlier
              history lines.

       transpose-lines
              Only useful with a multi-line editing buffer; the lines here are
              lines within the current on-screen buffer,  not  history  lines.
              The effect is similar to the function of the same name in Emacs.

              Transpose the current line with the previous line and  move  the
              cursor to the start of the next line.  Repeating this (which can
              be done by providing a positive numeric argument) has the effect
              of moving the line above the cursor down by a number of lines.

              With  a  negative numeric argument, requires two lines above the
              cursor.  These two lines are transposed and the cursor moved  to
              the  start  of the previous line.  Using a numeric argument less
              than -1 has the effect of moving the line above the cursor up by
              minus that number of lines.

       which-command
              This  function  is  a drop-in replacement for the builtin widget
              which-command.  It has enhanced behaviour, in that it  correctly
              detects  whether or not the command word needs to be expanded as
              an alias; if so, it continues tracing the command word from  the
              expanded  alias  until  it reaches the command that will be exe-
              cuted.

              The style whence is available in the context :zle:$WIDGET;  this
              may be set to an array to give the command and options that will
              be used to investigate the command word found.  The  default  is
              whence -c.

       zcalc-auto-insert
              This  function  is  useful  together  with  the  zcalc  function
              described in the section Mathematical Functions.  It  should  be
              bound  to a key representing a binary operator such as `+', `-',
              `*' or `/'.  When running in zcalc, if the  key  occurs  at  the
              start  of the line or immediately following an open parenthesis,
              the text "ans " is inserted before the representation of the key
              itself.   This  allows  easy use of the answer from the previous
              calculation in the current line.  The text to be inserted before
              the  symbol  typed  can  be  modified  by  setting  the variable
              ZCALC_AUTO_INSERT_PREFIX.

              Hence, for example, typing `+12' followed by return adds  12  to
              the previous result.

              When not in zcalc, the key simply inserts the symbol itself.


   Utility Functions
       These  functions  are  useful  in constructing widgets.  They should be
       loaded with  `autoload  -U  function'  and  called  as  indicated  from
       user-defined widgets.

       split-shell-arguments
              This  function splits the line currently being edited into shell
              arguments and whitespace.  The result is  stored  in  the  array
              reply.   The  array contains all the parts of the line in order,
              starting with any whitespace before the first argument, and fin-
              ishing  with  any whitespace after the last argument.  Hence (so
              long as the option KSH_ARRAYS is not set) whitespace is given by
              odd  indices  in  the array and arguments by even indices.  Note
              that no stripping of quotes is done; joining  together  all  the
              elements of reply in order is guaranteed to produce the original
              line.

              The parameter REPLY is set to the index of  the  word  in  reply
              which  contains  the character after the cursor, where the first
              element has index 1.  The parameter REPLY2 is set to  the  index
              of  the character under the cursor in that word, where the first
              character has index 1.

              Hence reply, REPLY and REPLY2 should all be made  local  to  the
              enclosing function.

              See  the  function modify-current-argument, described below, for
              an example of how to call this function.

       modify-current-argument [ expr-using-$ARG | func ]
              This function provides a simple method of allowing  user-defined
              widgets to modify the command line argument under the cursor (or
              immediately to the left of the cursor if the cursor  is  between
              arguments).

              The  argument can be an expression which when evaluated operates
              on the shell parameter ARG, which will have been set to the com-
              mand  line  argument under the cursor.  The expression should be
              suitably quoted to prevent it being evaluated too early.

              Alternatively, if the argument does not contain the string  ARG,
              it  is assumed to be a shell function, to which the current com-
              mand line argument is passed as the only argument.  The function
              should  set  the variable REPLY to the new value for the command
              line argument.  If the function returns non-zero status, so does
              the calling function.

              For example, a user-defined widget containing the following code
              converts the characters in the argument under  the  cursor  into
              all upper case:

                     modify-current-argument '${(U)ARG}'

              The  following strips any quoting from the current word (whether
              backslashes or one of the styles of  quotes),  and  replaces  it
              with single quoting throughout:

                     modify-current-argument '${(qq)${(Q)ARG}}'

              The  following  performs directory expansion on the command line
              argument and replaces it by the absolute path:

                     expand-dir() {
                       REPLY=${~1}
                       REPLY=${REPLY:a}
                     }
                     modify-current-argument expand-dir

              In practice  the  function  expand-dir  would  probably  not  be
              defined  within  the  widget  where  modify-current-argument  is
              called.


   Styles
       The behavior of several of the above widgets can be controlled  by  the
       use of the zstyle mechanism.  In particular, widgets that interact with
       the completion system pass along their context to any completions  that
       they invoke.

       break-keys
              This  style is used by the incremental-complete-word widget. Its
              value should be a pattern, and all keys  matching  this  pattern
              will cause the widget to stop incremental completion without the
              key having any further effect. Like all styles used directly  by
              incremental-complete-word,  this  style  is  looked up using the
              context `:incremental'.

       completer
              The incremental-complete-word and insert-and-predict widgets set
              up their top-level context name before calling completion.  This
              allows one to define different sets of completer  functions  for
              normal  completion  and  for these widgets.  For example, to use
              completion, approximation and correction for normal  completion,
              completion  and  correction  for incremental completion and only
              completion for prediction one could use:

                     zstyle ':completion:*' completer \
                             _complete _correct _approximate
                     zstyle ':completion:incremental:*' completer \
                             _complete _correct
                     zstyle ':completion:predict:*' completer \
                             _complete

              It is a good idea to restrict the completers used in prediction,
              because  they  may  be  automatically  invoked as you type.  The
              _list and _menu completers should never be used with prediction.
              The  _approximate,  _correct, _expand, and _match completers may
              be used, but be aware that they may change  characters  anywhere
              in  the  word  behind the cursor, so you need to watch carefully
              that the result is what you intended.

       cursor The insert-and-predict widget uses this style,  in  the  context
              `:predict', to decide where to place the cursor after completion
              has been tried.  Values are:

              complete
                     The cursor is left where it was when completion finished,
                     but only if it is after a character equal to the one just
                     inserted by the user.  If it is after another  character,
                     this value is the same as `key'.

              key    The  cursor is left after the nth occurrence of the char-
                     acter just inserted, where n is the number of times  that
                     character  appeared  in  the  word  before completion was
                     attempted.  In short, this has the effect of leaving  the
                     cursor after the character just typed even if the comple-
                     tion code found out that no other characters need  to  be
                     inserted at that position.

              Any other value for this style unconditionally leaves the cursor
              at the position where the completion code left it.

       list   When using the incremental-complete-word widget, this style says
              if  the matches should be listed on every key press (if they fit
              on the screen).  Use the context  prefix  `:completion:incremen-
              tal'.

              The  insert-and-predict  widget uses this style to decide if the
              completion should be shown even if there is  only  one  possible
              completion.   This  is  done  if  the value of this style is the
              string always.  In this case  the  context  is  `:predict'  (not
              `:completion:predict').

       match  This  style  is used by smart-insert-last-word to provide a pat-
              tern (using full EXTENDED_GLOB syntax) that matches an interest-
              ing  word.   The  context  is  the  name  of the widget to which
              smart-insert-last-word is bound (see above).  The default behav-
              ior of smart-insert-last-word is equivalent to:

                     zstyle :insert-last-word match '*[[:alpha:]/\\]*'

              However, you might want to include words that contain spaces:

                     zstyle :insert-last-word match '*[[:alpha:][:space:]/\\]*'

              Or  include  numbers as long as the word is at least two charac-
              ters long:

                     zstyle :insert-last-word match '*([[:digit:]]?|[[:alpha:]/\\])*'

              The above example causes redirections like "2>" to be  included.

       prompt The  incremental-complete-word  widget  shows  the value of this
              style in the status line  during  incremental  completion.   The
              string  value may contain any of the following substrings in the
              manner of the PS1 and other prompt parameters:

              %c     Replaced by the name of the completer function that  gen-
                     erated the matches (without the leading underscore).

              %l     When the list style is set, replaced by `...' if the list
                     of matches is too long to fit on the screen and  with  an
                     empty  string otherwise.  If the list style is `false' or
                     not set, `%l' is always removed.

              %n     Replaced by the number of matches generated.

              %s     Replaced by `-no match-',  `-no  prefix-',  or  an  empty
                     string if there is no completion matching the word on the
                     line, if the matches have no common prefix different from
                     the  word  on the line, or if there is such a common pre-
                     fix, respectively.

              %u     Replaced by the unambiguous part of all matches, if there
                     is any, and if it is different from the word on the line.

              Like `break-keys', this uses the `:incremental' context.

       stop-keys
              This style is used by the incremental-complete-word widget.  Its
              value  is  treated similarly to the one for the break-keys style
              (and uses the same context: `:incremental').  However,  in  this
              case  all keys matching the pattern given as its value will stop
              incremental completion and will then execute their  usual  func-
              tion.

       toggle This boolean style is used by predict-on and its related widgets
              in the context `:predict'.  If set to one of the standard `true'
              values, predictive typing is automatically toggled off in situa-
              tions where it is unlikely to be useful, such as when editing  a
              multi-line  buffer or after moving into the middle of a line and
              then deleting a character.  The default is to  leave  prediction
              turned on until an explicit call to predict-off.

       verbose
              This boolean style is used by predict-on and its related widgets
              in the context `:predict'.  If set to one of the standard `true'
              values,  these  widgets  display a message below the prompt when
              the predictive state is toggled.  This is most useful in  combi-
              nation  with  the  toggle  style.   The default does not display
              these messages.

       widget This style is similar to the command style: For widget functions
              that  use zle to call other widgets, this style can sometimes be
              used to override the widget which is called.   The  context  for
              this  style  is  the name of the calling widget (not the name of
              the calling function, because one function may be bound to  mul-
              tiple widget names).

                     zstyle :copy-earlier-word widget smart-insert-last-word

              Check  the  documentation  for the calling widget or function to
              determine whether the widget style is used.


EXCEPTION HANDLING
       Two functions are provided to enable zsh to provide exception  handling
       in a form that should be familiar from other languages.

       throw exception
              The  function  throw throws the named exception.  The name is an
              arbitrary string and is only used by the throw and  catch  func-
              tions.   An exception is for the most part treated the same as a
              shell error, i.e. an unhandled exception will cause the shell to
              abort  all  processing  in a function or script and to return to
              the top level in an interactive shell.

       catch exception-pattern
              The function catch returns  status  zero  if  an  exception  was
              thrown and the pattern exception-pattern matches its name.  Oth-
              erwise it returns status 1.   exception-pattern  is  a  standard
              shell   pattern,   respecting   the   current   setting  of  the
              EXTENDED_GLOB option.  An alias catch is also defined to prevent
              the  argument  to  the function from matching filenames, so pat-
              terns may be used unquoted.  Note that  as  exceptions  are  not
              fundamentally  different  from other shell errors it is possible
              to catch shell errors by using an empty string as the  exception
              name.   The shell variable CAUGHT is set by catch to the name of
              the exception caught.  It is possible to rethrow an exception by
              calling  the  throw  function  again  once an exception has been
              caught.

       The functions are designed to be used together  with  the  always  con-
       struct  described  in  zshmisc(1).  This is important as only this con-
       struct provides the required support for exceptions.  A typical example
       is as follows.

              {
                # "try" block
                # ... nested code here calls "throw MyExcept"
              } always {
                # "always" block
                if catch MyExcept; then
                  print "Caught exception MyExcept"
                elif catch ''; then
                  print "Caught a shell error.  Propagating..."
                  throw ''
                fi
                # Other exceptions are not handled but may be caught further
                # up the call stack.
              }

       If  all  exceptions  should  be  caught,  the  following idiom might be
       preferable.

              {
                # ... nested code here throws an exception
              } always {
                if catch *; then
                  case $CAUGHT in
                    (MyExcept)
                    print "Caught my own exception"
                    ;;
                    (*)
                    print "Caught some other exception"
                    ;;
                  esac
                fi
              }

       In common with exception handling in other languages, the exception may
       be  thrown by code deeply nested inside the `try' block.  However, note
       that it must be thrown inside the current  shell,  not  in  a  subshell
       forked  for  a pipeline, parenthesised current-shell construct, or some
       form of command or process substitution.

       The system internally uses the shell variable EXCEPTION to  record  the
       name  of  the exception between throwing and catching.  One drawback of
       this scheme is that if the exception is not handled the variable EXCEP-
       TION  remains  set  and may be incorrectly recognised as the name of an
       exception if a shell error subsequently occurs.  Adding unset EXCEPTION
       at  the  start  of  the outermost layer of any code that uses exception
       handling will eliminate this problem.


MIME FUNCTIONS
       Three functions are available to provide handling of  files  recognised
       by extension, for example to dispatch a file text.ps when executed as a
       command to an appropriate viewer.

       zsh-mime-setup [ -fv ] [ -l [ suffix ... ] ]
       zsh-mime-handler [ -l ] command argument ...
              These  two   functions   use   the   files   ~/.mime.types   and
              /etc/mime.types,  which  associate types and extensions, as well
              as ~/.mailcap and /etc/mailcap files, which associate types  and
              the  programs that handle them.  These are provided on many sys-
              tems with the Multimedia Internet Mail Extensions.

              To enable the system,  the  function  zsh-mime-setup  should  be
              autoloaded  and  run.   This  allows files with extensions to be
              treated as executable; such files be completed by  the  function
              completion  system.   The  function  zsh-mime-handler should not
              need to be called by the user.

              The system works by setting up suffix aliases with  `alias  -s'.
              Suffix  aliases  already installed by the user will not be over-
              written.

              For suffixes defined in lower case,  upper  case  variants  will
              also automatically be handled (e.g. PDF is automatically handled
              if handling for the suffix pdf is defined), but not vice  versa.

              Repeated  calls  to  zsh-mime-setup do not override the existing
              mapping between suffixes and executable files unless the  option
              -f  is given.  Note, however, that this does not override exist-
              ing suffix aliases assigned to handlers other than zsh-mime-han-
              dler.

              Calling  zsh-mime-setup  with  the  option -l lists the existing
              mappings without altering them.  Suffixes  to  list  (which  may
              contain  pattern characters that should be quoted from immediate
              interpretation on the command line) may be given  as  additional
              arguments, otherwise all suffixes are listed.

              Calling  zsh-mime-setup with the option -v causes verbose output
              to be shown during the setup operation.

              The system respects the mailcap flags  needsterminal  and  copi-
              ousoutput, see mailcap(4).

              The  functions  use the following styles, which are defined with
              the zstyle builtin command (see zshmodules(1)).  They should  be
              defined  before  zsh-mime-setup  is  run.  The contexts used all
              start with :mime:, with additional components in some cases.  It
              is  recommended  that a trailing * (suitably quoted) be appended
              to style patterns in case the  system  is  extended  in  future.
              Some examples are given below.

              For  files  that have multiple suffixes, e.g. .pdf.gz, where the
              context includes the suffix it will be looked up  starting  with
              the  longest  possible  suffix  until  a  match for the style is
              found.  For example, if .pdf.gz produces a match  for  the  han-
              dler,  that  will be used; otherwise the handler for .gz will be
              used.  Note that, owing to the way suffix aliases  work,  it  is
              always  required that there be a handler for the shortest possi-
              ble suffix, so in this example .pdf.gz can only  be  handled  if
              .gz  is  also  handled (though not necessarily in the same way).
              Alternatively, if no handling for .gz on its own is needed, sim-
              ply adding the command

                     alias -s gz=zsh-mime-handler

              to  the  initialisation code is sufficient; .gz will not be han-
              dled on its own, but may be in combination with other  suffixes.

              current-shell
                     If  this  boolean  style is true, the mailcap handler for
                     the context in question is run  using  the  eval  builtin
                     instead  of  by  starting a new sh process.  This is more
                     efficient, but may not work in the occasional cases where
                     the mailcap handler uses strict POSIX syntax.

              disown If  this  boolean style is true, mailcap handlers started
                     in the background will be disowned, i.e. not  subject  to
                     job  control  within  the  parent  shell.   Such handlers
                     nearly always produce their  own  windows,  so  the  only
                     likely  harmful  side effect of setting the style is that
                     it becomes harder to kill jobs from within the shell.

              execute-as-is
                     This style gives a list of patterns to be matched against
                     files  passed  for  execution with a handler program.  If
                     the file matches the pattern, the entire command line  is
                     executed  in  its current form, with no handler.  This is
                     useful for files which might have suffixes  but  nonethe-
                     less  be  executable in their own right.  If the style is
                     not set, the pattern *(*) *(/) is used; hence  executable
                     files  are executed directly and not passed to a handler,
                     and the option AUTO_CD may be used to change to  directo-
                     ries that happen to have MIME suffixes.

              execute-never
                     This  style  is useful in combination with execute-as-is.
                     It is set to an array of patterns corresponding  to  full
                     paths  to  files  that  should  never  be treated as exe-
                     cutable, even if the file  passed  to  the  MIME  handler
                     matches  execute-as-is.   This is useful for file systems
                     that don't handle execute permission or that contain exe-
                     cutables  from another operating system.  For example, if
                     /mnt/windows is a Windows mount, then

                            zstyle ':mime:*' execute-never '/mnt/windows/*'

                     will ensure that any files found in  that  area  will  be
                     executed  as  MIME types even if they are executable.  As
                     this example shows, the complete  file  name  is  matched
                     against  the  pattern,  regardless  of  how  the file was
                     passed to the handler.  The file is resolved  to  a  full
                     path  using  the  :A modifier described in the subsection
                     Modifiers in zshexpn(1); this means that  symbolic  links
                     are  resolved  where  possible,  so that links into other
                     file systems behave in the correct fashion.

              file-path
                     Used if the style find-file-in-path is true for the  same
                     context.   Set  to  an array of directories that are used
                     for searching for the file to be handled; the default  is
                     the  command  path  given  by the special parameter path.
                     The shell option PATH_DIRS is respected; if that is  set,
                     the appropriate path will be searched even if the name of
                     the file to be handled as it appears on the command  line
                     contains  a  `/'.  The full context is :mime:.suffix:, as
                     described for the style handler.

              find-file-in-path
                     If set, allows files whose names do not contain  absolute
                     paths  to be searched for in the command path or the path
                     specified by the file-path style.  If  the  file  is  not
                     found  in  the path, it is looked for locally (whether or
                     not the current directory is in the path); if it  is  not
                     found  locally,  the  handler  will abort unless the han-
                     dle-nonexistent style is set.  Files found  in  the  path
                     are tested as described for the style execute-as-is.  The
                     full context is  :mime:.suffix:,  as  described  for  the
                     style handler.

              flags  Defines flags to go with a handler; the context is as for
                     the handler style, and the format is as for the flags  in
                     mailcap.

              handle-nonexistent
                     By  default, arguments that don't correspond to files are
                     not passed to the MIME handler in  order  to  prevent  it
                     from  intercepting commands found in the path that happen
                     to have suffixes.  This style may be set to an  array  of
                     extended  glob patterns for arguments that will be passed
                     to the handler even if they don't exist.  If  it  is  not
                     explicitly  set  it  defaults  to  [[:alpha:]]#:/*  which
                     allows URLs to be passed to the MIME handler even  though
                     they  don't exist in that format in the file system.  The
                     full context is  :mime:.suffix:,  as  described  for  the
                     style handler.

              handler
                     Specifies  a handler for a suffix; the suffix is given by
                     the context as :mime:.suffix:, and the format of the han-
                     dler  is exactly that in mailcap.  Note in particular the
                     `.' and trailing colon to distinguish  this  use  of  the
                     context.   This  overrides  any  handler specified by the
                     mailcap files.  If the handler requires a  terminal,  the
                     flags style should be set to include the word needstermi-
                     nal, or if the output is to be displayed through a  pager
                     (but  not  if  the  handler is itself a pager), it should
                     include copiousoutput.

              mailcap
                     A  list  of  files  in  the  format  of  ~/.mailcap   and
                     /etc/mailcap  to  be  read  during  setup,  replacing the
                     default list which consists of those two files.  The con-
                     text  is :mime:.  A + in the list will be replaced by the
                     default files.

              mailcap-priorities
                     This style is used to resolve  multiple  mailcap  entries
                     for  the  same MIME type.  It consists of an array of the
                     following elements,  in  descending  order  of  priority;
                     later  entries will be used if earlier entries are unable
                     to resolve the entries being compared.  If  none  of  the
                     tests resolve the entries, the first entry encountered is
                     retained.

                     files  The order of files (entries in the mailcap  style)
                            read.   Earlier  files  are preferred.  (Note this
                            does not resolve entries in the same file.)

                     priority
                            The priority flag from  the  mailcap  entry.   The
                            priority  is  an  integer  from  0  to  9 with the
                            default value being 5.

                     flags  The test given by the mailcap-prio-flags option is
                            used to resolve entries.

                     place  Later  entries  are  preferred; as the entries are
                            strictly ordered, this test always succeeds.

                     Note that as this style is handled during initialisation,
                     the  context  is always :mime:, with no discrimination by
                     suffix.

              mailcap-prio-flags
                     This style is used when the keyword flags is  encountered
                     in  the list of tests specified by the mailcap-priorities
                     style.  It should be set to a list of patterns,  each  of
                     which  is tested against the flags specified in the mail-
                     cap entry (in other words, the sets of assignments  found
                     with some entries in the mailcap file).  Earlier patterns
                     in the list are preferred to later ones, and matched pat-
                     terns are preferred to unmatched ones.

              mime-types
                     A  list  of  files  in  the  format  of ~/.mime.types and
                     /etc/mime.types to be read during  setup,  replacing  the
                     default list which consists of those two files.  The con-
                     text is :mime:.  A + in the list will be replaced by  the
                     default files.

              never-background
                     If  this  boolean style is set, the handler for the given
                     context is always run in  the  foreground,  even  if  the
                     flags  provided  in the mailcap entry suggest it need not
                     be (for example, it doesn't require a terminal).

              pager  If set, will be used instead of $PAGER or more to  handle
                     suffixes  where  the copiousoutput flag is set.  The con-
                     text is as for handler, i.e. :mime:.suffix: for  handling
                     a file with the given suffix.

              Examples:

                     zstyle ':mime:*' mailcap ~/.mailcap /usr/local/etc/mailcap
                     zstyle ':mime:.txt:' handler less %s
                     zstyle ':mime:.txt:' flags needsterminal

              When  zsh-mime-setup is subsequently run, it will look for mail-
              cap entries in the two files given.  Files of suffix  .txt  will
              be  handled  by running `less file.txt'.  The flag needsterminal
              is set to show that this program must run attached to  a  termi-
              nal.

              As there are several steps to dispatching a command, the follow-
              ing should be checked if attempting to execute a file by  exten-
              sion .ext does not have the expected effect.

              The  command  `alias  -s ext' should show `ps=zsh-mime-handler'.
              If it shows something else, another  suffix  alias  was  already
              installed and was not overwritten.  If it shows nothing, no han-
              dler was installed:  this is most likely because no handler  was
              found in the .mime.types and mailcap combination for .ext files.
              In  that  case,  appropriate  handling  should   be   added   to
              ~/.mime.types and mailcap.

              If  the extension is handled by zsh-mime-handler but the file is
              not opened correctly, either the handler defined for the type is
              incorrect,  or  the flags associated with it are in appropriate.
              Running zsh-mime-setup -l will show the handler  and,  if  there
              are any, the flags.  A %s in the handler is replaced by the file
              (suitably quoted if necessary).  Check that the handler  program
              listed  lists  and can be run in the way shown.  Also check that
              the flags needsterminal or copiousoutput are set if the  handler
              needs to be run under a terminal; the second flag is used if the
              output should be sent to a pager.   An  example  of  a  suitable
              mailcap entry for such a program is:

                     text/html; /usr/bin/lynx '%s'; needsterminal

              Running  `zsh-mime-handler  -l  command line' prints the command
              line that would be executed, simplified to remove the effect  of
              any  flags,  and  quoted so that the output can be run as a com-
              plete zsh command line.  This is used by the  completion  system
              to  decide how to complete after a file handled by zsh-mime-set-
              up.

       pick-web-browser
              This function is separate from the two MIME functions  described
              above and can be assigned directly to a suffix:

                     autoload -U pick-web-browser
                     alias -s html=pick-web-browser

              It  is  provided  as  an intelligent front end to dispatch a web
              browser.  It may be run as either a function or a shell  script.
              The status 255 is returned if no browser could be started.

              Various   styles  are  available  to  customize  the  choice  of
              browsers:

              browser-style
                     The value of the style is an array giving preferences  in
                     decreasing  order  for  the  type of browser to use.  The
                     values of elements may be

                     running
                            Use a GUI browser that is already running when  an
                            X  Window  display  is  available.   The  browsers
                            listed in the x-browsers style are tried in  order
                            until  one  is  found;  if it is, the file will be
                            displayed in that browser, so the user may need to
                            check  whether  it  has  appeared.   If no running
                            browser is found, one is  not  started.   Browsers
                            other   than  Firefox,  Opera  and  Konqueror  are
                            assumed to understand the Mozilla syntax for open-
                            ing a URL remotely.

                     x      Start  a  new GUI browser when an X Window display
                            is available.  Search for the availability of  one
                            of the browsers listed in the x-browsers style and
                            start the first one that is found.   No  check  is
                            made for an already running browser.

                     tty    Start  a  terminal-based  browser.  Search for the
                            availability of one of the browsers listed in  the
                            tty-browsers style and start the first one that is
                            found.

                     If the style is not set the  default  running  x  tty  is
                     used.

              x-browsers
                     An array in decreasing order of preference of browsers to
                     use when running under the X Window  System.   The  array
                     consists  of  the  command  name under which to start the
                     browser.  They are looked up in the context :mime: (which
                     may  be  extended  in  future, so appending `*' is recom-
                     mended).  For example,

                            zstyle ':mime:*' x-browsers opera konqueror firefox

                     specifies that pick-web-browser should first look  for  a
                     running  instance of Opera, Konqueror or Firefox, in that
                     order, and if it fails to  find  any  should  attempt  to
                     start  Opera.   The  default  is firefox mozilla netscape
                     opera konqueror.

              tty-browsers
                     An array similar to  x-browsers,  except  that  it  gives
                     browsers  to  use  when no X Window display is available.
                     The default is elinks links lynx.

              command
                     If it is set this style is used to pick the command  used
                     to   open   a   page  for  a  browser.   The  context  is
                     :mime:browser:new:$browser: to start  a  new  browser  or
                     :mime:browser:running:$browser:   to  open  a  URL  in  a
                     browser already running on the current X  display,  where
                     $browser  is  the  value  matched  in  the  x-browsers or
                     tty-browsers  style.   The  escape  sequence  %b  in  the
                     style's  value  will be replaced by the browser, while %u
                     will be replaced by the URL.  If the style  is  not  set,
                     the  default for all new instances is equivalent to %b %u
                     and the defaults for using running browsers  are  equiva-
                     lent  to  the  values kfmclient openURL %u for Konqueror,
                     firefox -new-tab %u for Firefox, opera  -newpage  %u  for
                     Opera, and %b -remote "openUrl(%u)" for all others.


MATHEMATICAL FUNCTIONS
       zcalc [ -ef ] [ expression ... ]
              A reasonably powerful calculator based on zsh's arithmetic eval-
              uation facility.  The syntax is similar to that of  formulae  in
              most  programming languages; see the section `Arithmetic Evalua-
              tion' in zshmisc(1) for details.

              Non-programmers should note that, as in many  other  programming
              languages,  expressions  involving  only  integers (whether con-
              stants without a `.', variables  containing  such  constants  as
              strings,  or  variables  declared to be integers) are by default
              evaluated using integer arithmetic, which is not how an ordinary
              desk  calculator  operates.   To force floating point operation,
              pass the option -f; see further notes below.

              The mathematical library zsh/mathfunc will be loaded  if  it  is
              available;  see the section `The zsh/mathfunc Module' in zshmod-
              ules(1).  The mathematical functions correspond to the raw  sys-
              tem  libraries,  so  trigonometric functions are evaluated using
              radians, and so on.

              Each line typed is evaluated as an expression.  The prompt shows
              a  number, which corresponds to a positional parameter where the
              result of that calculation is stored.  For example,  the  result
              of the calculation on the line preceded by `4> ' is available as
              $4.  The last value calculated is available as ans.   Full  com-
              mand  line  editing,  including the history of previous calcula-
              tions,  is  available;  the  history  is  saved  in   the   file
              ~/.zcalc_history.   To  exit, enter a blank line or type `:q' on
              its own (`q' is allowed for historical compatibility).

              A line ending with a single backslash is  treated  in  the  same
              fashion  as  it  is  in  command line editing:  the backslash is
              removed, the function prompts for more input (the prompt is pre-
              ceded  by  `...'  to  indicate this), and the lines are combined
              into one to get the final result.  In addition, if the input  so
              far  contains more open than close parentheses zcalc will prompt
              for more input.

              If arguments are given to zcalc on start up, they  are  used  to
              prime  the first few positional parameters.  A visual indication
              of this is given when the calculator starts.

              The constants PI (3.14159...) and E (2.71828...)  are  provided.
              Parameter  assignment  is possible, but note that all parameters
              will be put into the global namespace.

              The output  base  can  be  initialised  by  passing  the  option
              `-#base',  for  example  `zcalc  -#16'  (the  `#' may have to be
              quoted, depending on the globbing options set).

              If the option `-e' is set, the function runs  non-interactively:
              the  arguments  are treated as expressions to be evaluated as if
              entered interactively line by line.

              If the option `-f' is set, all numbers are treated  as  floating
              point,  hence for example the expression `3/4' evaluates to 0.75
              rather than 0.  Options must appear in separate words.

              The prompt is configurable via the parameter ZCALCPROMPT,  which
              undergoes  standard  prompt expansion.  The index of the current
              entry is stored locally in the first element of the array psvar,
              which  can  be referred to in ZCALCPROMPT as `%1v'.  The default
              prompt is `%1v> '.

              A few special commands are available; these are introduced by  a
              colon.  For backward compatibility, the colon may be omitted for
              certain commands.  Completion is available if compinit has  been
              run.

              The  output  precision  may be specified within zcalc by special
              commands familiar from many calculators.
              :norm  The default output format.  It corresponds to the  printf
                     %g  specification.  Typically this shows six decimal dig-
                     its.

              :sci digits
                     Scientific notation, corresponding to the printf %g  out-
                     put format with the precision given by digits.  This pro-
                     duces either fixed point or exponential notation  depend-
                     ing on the value output.

              :fix digits
                     Fixed point notation, corresponding to the printf %f out-
                     put format with the precision given by digits.

              :eng digits
                     Exponential notation, corresponding to the printf %E out-
                     put format with the precision given by digits.

              :raw   Raw  output:  this is the default form of the output from
                     a math evaluation.  This may show more precision than the
                     number actually possesses.

              Other special commands:
              :!line...
                     Execute  line...  as  a  normal shell command line.  Note
                     that it is executed in the context of the function,  i.e.
                     with local variables.  Space is optional after :!.

              :local arg ...
                     Declare  variables local to the function.  Note that cer-
                     tain variables are used by the function for its own  pur-
                     poses.   Other  variables may be used, too, but they will
                     be taken from or put into the global scope.

              :function name [ body ]
                     Define a mathematical function or (with no  body)  delete
                     it.   :function may be abbreviated to :func or simply :f.
                     The name may contain the same characters as a shell func-
                     tion  name.   The function is defined using zmathfuncdef,
                     see below.

                     Note that zcalc takes care of  all  quoting.   Hence  for
                     example:

                            :f cube $1 * $1 * $1

                     defines a function to cube the sole argument.

              [#base]
                     This  is  not  a  special  command, rather part of normal
                     arithmetic syntax; however, when this form appears  on  a
                     line  by  itself the default output radix is set to base.
                     Use, for example, `[#16]' to display  hexadecimal  output
                     preceded  by  an indication of the base, or `[##16]' just
                     to display the raw number in the given base.  Bases them-
                     selves  are  always  specified in decimal. `[#]' restores
                     the normal output format.  Note that  setting  an  output
                     base  suppresses  floating  point  output;  use  `[#]' to
                     return to normal operation.

              See the comments in the function for a few extra tips.

       zmathfuncdef [ mathfunc [ body ] ]
              A convenient front end to functions -M.

              With two arguments, define a mathematical function  named  math-
              func  which  can  be  used in any form of arithmetic evaluation.
              body is a mathematical expression to implement the function.  It
              may  contain  references  to position parameters $1, $2, ...  to
              refer to mandatory parameters and ${1:-defvalue} ...   to  refer
              to  optional  parameters.   Note that the forms must be strictly
              adhered to for the function to calculate the correct  number  of
              arguments.  The implementation is held in a shell function named
              zsh_math_func_mathfunc; usually the user will not need to  refer
              to  the  shell  function directly.  Any existing function of the
              same name is silently replaced.

              With one argument, remove the mathematical function mathfunc  as
              well as the shell function implementation.

              With  no  arguments, list all mathfunc functions in a form suit-
              able for restoring the definition.  The functions have not  nec-
              essarily been defined by zmathfuncdef.


USER CONFIGURATION FUNCTIONS
       The  zsh/newuser  module  comes  with  a function to aid in configuring
       shell options for new users.  If the module is installed, this function
       can  also be run by hand.  It is available even if the module's default
       behaviour, namely running the function for a new user logging in  with-
       out startup files, is inhibited.

       zsh-newuser-install [ -f ]
              The  function  presents  the  user with various options for cus-
              tomizing their initialization scripts.  Currently only  ~/.zshrc
              is  handled.   $ZDOTDIR/.zshrc  is used instead if the parameter
              ZDOTDIR is set; this provides a way for the user to configure  a
              file without altering an existing .zshrc.

              By default the function exits immediately if it finds any of the
              files .zshenv, .zprofile, .zshrc, or .zlogin in the  appropriate
              directory.   The  option  -f  is  required in order to force the
              function to continue.  Note  this  may  happen  even  if  .zshrc
              itself does not exist.

              As  currently  configured, the function will exit immediately if
              the user has root privileges; this behaviour cannot be  overrid-
              den.

              Once  activated,  the  function's  behaviour  is  supposed to be
              self-explanatory.  Menus are present allowing the user to  alter
              the  value  of options and parameters.  Suggestions for improve-
              ments are always welcome.

              When the script exits, the user is given the opportunity to save
              the  new  file  or  not; changes are not irreversible until this
              point.  However, the script is careful to  restrict  changes  to
              the file only to a group marked by the lines `# Lines configured
              by zsh-newuser-install'  and  `#  End  of  lines  configured  by
              zsh-newuser-install'.  In addition, the old version of .zshrc is
              saved to a file with the suffix .zni appended.

              If the function edits an existing .zshrc, it is up to  the  user
              to  ensure that the changes made will take effect.  For example,
              if control usually returns early from the  existing  .zshrc  the
              lines  will  not be executed; or a later initialization file may
              override options or parameters, and so on.  The function  itself
              does not attempt to detect any such conflicts.


OTHER FUNCTIONS
       There  are  a  large  number of helpful functions in the Functions/Misc
       directory of the zsh distribution.  Most are very  simple  and  do  not
       require documentation here, but a few are worthy of special mention.


   Descriptions
       colors This  function  initializes  several  associative  arrays to map
              color names to (and from) the ANSI standard eight-color terminal
              codes.   These  are used by the prompt theme system (see above).
              You seldom should need to run colors more than once.

              The eight base colors are:  black,  red,  green,  yellow,  blue,
              magenta,  cyan,  and  white.   Each of these has codes for fore-
              ground and background.  In addition there  are  seven  intensity
              attributes:  bold,  faint,  standout, underline, blink, reverse,
              and conceal.  Finally, there are  seven  codes  used  to  negate
              attributes:  none (reset all attributes to the defaults), normal
              (neither bold nor faint), no-standout,  no-underline,  no-blink,
              no-reverse, and no-conceal.

              Some  terminals  do  not  support all combinations of colors and
              intensities.

              The associative arrays are:

              color
              colour Map all the color names to their integer codes, and inte-
                     ger  codes  to the color names.  The eight base names map
                     to the foreground color codes, as do names prefixed  with
                     `fg-', such as `fg-red'.  Names prefixed with `bg-', such
                     as `bg-blue', refer to the background codes.  The reverse
                     mapping  from  code  to  color yields base name for fore-
                     ground codes and the bg- form for backgrounds.

                     Although it is a misnomer to call  them  `colors',  these
                     arrays  also map the other fourteen attributes from names
                     to codes and codes to names.

              fg
              fg_bold
              fg_no_bold
                     Map the eight basic color names to ANSI  terminal  escape
                     sequences  that  set  the  corresponding  foreground text
                     properties.  The fg sequences change  the  color  without
                     changing the eight intensity attributes.

              bg
              bg_bold
              bg_no_bold
                     Map  the  eight basic color names to ANSI terminal escape
                     sequences that set the corresponding  background  proper-
                     ties.  The bg sequences change the color without changing
                     the eight intensity attributes.

              In addition, the scalar parameters  reset_color  and  bold_color
              are  set  to  the  ANSI  terminal  escapes  that  turn  off  all
              attributes and turn on bold intensity, respectively.

       fned name
              Same as zed -f.  This function does not appear in the  zsh  dis-
              tribution, but can be created by linking zed to the name fned in
              some directory in your fpath.

       is-at-least needed [ present ]
              Perform a greater-than-or-equal-to  comparison  of  two  strings
              having  the format of a zsh version number; that is, a string of
              numbers and text with segments separated by dots or dashes.   If
              the  present string is not provided, $ZSH_VERSION is used.  Seg-
              ments are paired left-to-right in the two strings  with  leading
              non-number parts ignored.  If one string has fewer segments than
              the other, the missing segments are considered zero.

              This is useful in startup files to set options and  other  state
              that are not available in all versions of zsh.

                     is-at-least 3.1.6-15 && setopt NO_GLOBAL_RCS
                     is-at-least 3.1.0 && setopt HIST_REDUCE_BLANKS
                     is-at-least 2.6-17 || print "You can't use is-at-least here."

       nslookup [ arg ... ]
              This  wrapper  function  for  the  nslookup command requires the
              zsh/zpty module (see zshmodules(1)).  It  behaves  exactly  like
              the  standard  nslookup  except  that  it  provides customizable
              prompts  (including  a  right-side  prompt)  and  completion  of
              nslookup  commands,  host  names,  etc.  (if  you  use the func-
              tion-based completion system).  Completion  styles  may  be  set
              with the context prefix `:completion:nslookup'.

              See also the pager, prompt and rprompt styles below.

       regexp-replace var regexp replace
              Use  regular  expressions to perform a global search and replace
              operation on a variable.  If the  option  RE_MATCH_PCRE  is  not
              set, POSIX extended regular expressions are used, else Perl-com-
              patible regular expressions  (this  requires  the  shell  to  be
              linked against the pcre library).

              var  is  the  name  of  the variable containing the string to be
              matched.  The variable will be modified directly  by  the  func-
              tion.   The  variables  MATCH, MBEGIN, MEND, match, mbegin, mend
              should be avoided as these are used by  the  regular  expression
              code.

              regexp is the regular expression to match against the string.

              replace  is  the  replacement text.  This can contain parameter,
              command and arithmetic expressions which will be  replaced:   in
              particular,  a  reference to $MATCH will be replaced by the text
              matched by the pattern.

              The return status is 0 if at least one match was performed, else
              1.

       run-help cmd
              This function is designed to be invoked by the run-help ZLE wid-
              get, in place of the  default  alias.   See  `Accessing  On-Line
              Help' above for setup instructions.

              In  the  discussion which follows, if cmd is a file system path,
              it is first reduced to its rightmost component (the file  name).

              Help  is  first  sought  by  looking for a file named cmd in the
              directory named by the HELPDIR parameter.  If no file is  found,
              an  assistant  function, alias, or command named run-help-cmd is
              sought.  If found, the assistant is executed with  the  rest  of
              the current command line (everything after the command name cmd)
              as its arguments.  When neither file nor assistant is found, the
              external command `man cmd' is run.

              An example assistant for the "ssh" command:

                     run-help-ssh() {
                         emulate -LR zsh
                         local -a args
                         # Delete the "-l username" option
                         zparseopts -D -E -a args l:
                         # Delete other options, leaving: host command
                         args=(${@:#-*})
                         if [[ ${#args} -lt 2 ]]; then
                             man ssh
                         else
                             run-help $args[2]
                         fi
                     }

              Several  of  these assistants are provided in the Functions/Misc
              directory.  These must be autoloaded, or  placed  as  executable
              scripts  in  your  search path, in order to be found and used by
              run-help.

              run-help-git
              run-help-svk
              run-help-svn
                     Assistant functions for the git, svk, and svn commands.

       tetris Zsh was once accused of not being as complete as Emacs,  because
              it  lacked  a  Tetris game.  This function was written to refute
              this vicious slander.

              This function must be used as a ZLE widget:

                     autoload -U tetris
                     zle -N tetris
                     bindkey keys tetris

              To start a game, execute the widget by typing the  keys.   What-
              ever  command  line you were editing disappears temporarily, and
              your keymap is also temporarily replaced by the  Tetris  control
              keys.   The  previous editor state is restored when you quit the
              game (by pressing `q') or when you lose.

              If you quit in the middle of a game, the next invocation of  the
              tetris widget will continue where you left off.  If you lost, it
              will start a new game.

       tetriscurses
              This is a port of the above to zcurses.  The input  handling  is
              improved a bit so that moving a block sideways doesn't automati-
              cally advance a timestep, and the  graphics  use  unicode  block
              graphics.

              This  version  does not save the game state between invocations,
              and is not invoked as a widget, but rather as:

                     autoload -U tetriscurses
                     tetriscurses

       zargs [ option ... -- ] [ input ... ] [ -- command [ arg ... ] ]
              This function has a similar purpose to GNU  xargs.   Instead  of
              reading  lines  of  arguments  from the standard input, it takes
              them from the command line.  This is useful because  zsh,  espe-
              cially with recursive glob operators, often can construct a com-
              mand line for a shell  function  that  is  longer  than  can  be
              accepted by an external command.

              The  option list represents options of the zargs command itself,
              which are the same as those of xargs.  The  input  list  is  the
              collection  of  strings (often file names) that become the argu-
              ments of the command, analogous to the standard input of  xargs.
              Finally,  the  arg  list  consists  of  those arguments (usually
              options) that are passed to the command each time it runs.   The
              arg  list precedes the elements from the input list in each run.
              If no command is provided, then no arg list may be provided, and
              in  that event the default command is `print' with arguments `-r
              --'.

              For example, to get a long ls listing of all plain files in  the
              current directory or its subdirectories:

                     autoload -U zargs
                     zargs -- **/*(.) -- ls -l

              Note  that  `--' is used both to mark the end of the option list
              and to mark the end of the input list, so it must  appear  twice
              whenever the input list may be empty.  If there is guaranteed to
              be at least one input and the first input does not begin with  a
              `-', then the first `--' may be omitted.

              In  the event that the string `--' is or may be an input, the -e
              option may be used to change  the  end-of-inputs  marker.   Note
              that  this does not change the end-of-options marker.  For exam-
              ple, to use `..' as the marker:

                     zargs -e.. -- **/*(.) .. ls -l

              This is a good choice in that example because no plain file  can
              be  named  `..',  but the best end-marker depends on the circum-
              stances.

              The options -i, -I, -l, -L, and -n differ  slightly  from  their
              usage in xargs.  There are no input lines for zargs to count, so
              -l and -L count through the input list, and -n counts the number
              of  arguments passed to each execution of command, including any
              arg list.  Also, any time -i or -I is used, each input  is  pro-
              cessed separately as if by `-L 1'.

              For  details  of the other zargs options, see xargs(1) (but note
              the difference in function between zargs and xargs) or run zargs
              with the --help option.

       zed [ -f ] name
       zed -b This function uses the ZLE editor to edit a file or function.

              Only  one  name argument is allowed.  If the -f option is given,
              the name is taken to be that of a function; if the  function  is
              marked  for  autoloading,  zed  searches for it in the fpath and
              loads it.  Note that functions edited  this  way  are  installed
              into  the  current  shell,  but not written back to the autoload
              file.

              Without -f, name is the path name of the  file  to  edit,  which
              need not exist; it is created on write, if necessary.

              While  editing, the function sets the main keymap to zed and the
              vi command keymap to zed-vicmd.  These will be copied  from  the
              existing  main  and vicmd keymaps if they do not exist the first
              time zed is run.  They can be used to provide special key  bind-
              ings used only in zed.

              If it creates the keymap, zed rebinds the return key to insert a
              line break and `^X^W' to accept the edit in the zed keymap,  and
              binds `ZZ' to accept the edit in the zed-vicmd keymap.

              The  bindings  alone can be installed by running `zed -b'.  This
              is suitable for putting into a  startup  file.   Note  that,  if
              rerun,  this  will  overwrite  the  existing  zed  and zed-vicmd
              keymaps.

              Completion is available, and styles may be set with the  context
              prefix `:completion:zed'.

              A zle widget zed-set-file-name is available.  This can be called
              by name from within zed  using  `\ex  zed-set-file-name'  (note,
              however,  that because of zed's rebindings you will have to type
              ^j at the end instead of the return key), or can be bound  to  a
              key in either of the zed or zed-vicmd keymaps after `zed -b' has
              been run.  When the widget is called, it prompts for a new  name
              for  the  file  being  edited.   When zed exits the file will be
              written under that name and  the  original  file  will  be  left
              alone.  The widget has no effect with `zed -f'.

              While zed-set-file-name is running, zed uses the keymap zed-nor-
              mal-keymap, which is linked from the main keymap  in  effect  at
              the  time  zed  initialised  its bindings.  (This is to make the
              return key operate normally.)  The result is that  if  the  main
              keymap has been changed, the widget won't notice.  This is not a
              concern for most users.

       zcp [ -finqQvwW ] srcpat dest
       zln [ -finqQsvwW ] srcpat dest
              Same as zmv -C and zmv -L, respectively.  These functions do not
              appear  in  the  zsh distribution, but can be created by linking
              zmv to the names zcp and zln in some directory in your fpath.

       zkbd   See `Keyboard Definition' above.


       zmv [ -finqQsvwW ] [ -C | -L | -M | -{p|P} program ] [ -o optstring ]
           srcpat dest
              Move (usually, rename) files matching the pattern srcpat to cor-
              responding  files  having names of the form given by dest, where
              srcpat contains parentheses surrounding patterns which  will  be
              replaced in turn by $1, $2, ... in dest.  For example,

                     zmv '(*).lis' '$1.txt'

              renames    `foo.lis'   to   `foo.txt',   `my.old.stuff.lis'   to
              `my.old.stuff.txt', and so on.

              The pattern is always treated as an EXTENDED_GLOB pattern.   Any
              file  whose  name  is  not changed by the substitution is simply
              ignored.  Any error (a substitution resulted in an empty string,
              two  substitutions  gave the same result, the destination was an
              existing regular file and -f was not given)  causes  the  entire
              function to abort without doing anything.

              Options:

              -f     Force  overwriting  of  destination files.  Not currently
                     passed down to the mv/cp/ln command due  to  vagaries  of
                     implementations (but you can use -o-f to do that).
              -i     Interactive:  show  each  line to be executed and ask the
                     user whether to execute it.  `Y' or `y' will execute  it,
                     anything  else  will skip it.  Note that you just need to
                     type one character.
              -n     No execution: print what would happen, but don't do it.
              -q     Turn bare glob qualifiers off: now assumed by default, so
                     this has no effect.
              -Q     Force bare glob qualifiers on.  Don't turn this on unless
                     you are actually using glob qualifiers in a pattern.
              -s     Symbolic, passed down to ln; only works with -L.
              -v     Verbose: print each command as it's being executed.
              -w     Pick out wildcard parts  of  the  pattern,  as  described
                     above,  and  implicitly  add parentheses for referring to
                     them.
              -W     Just like -w, with the addition of turning  wildcards  in
                     the replacement pattern into sequential ${1} .. ${N} ref-
                     erences.
              -C
              -L
              -M     Force cp, ln or mv, respectively, regardless of the  name
                     of the function.
              -p program
                     Call  program instead of cp, ln or mv.  Whatever it does,
                     it should at least understand the form `program  --  old-
                     name  newname'  where  oldname  and newname are filenames
                     generated by zmv.  program will be split into  words,  so
                     might  be e.g. the name of an archive tool plus a copy or
                     rename subcommand.
              -P program
                     As -p program, except that program does not accept a fol-
                     lowing  --  to indicate the end of options.  In this case
                     filenames must already be in a sane form for the  program
                     in question.
              -o optstring
                     The  optstring is split into words and passed down verba-
                     tim to the cp, ln or mv command  called  to  perform  the
                     work.  It should probably begin with a `-'.

              Further examples:

                     zmv -v '(* *)' '${1// /_}'

              For any file in the current directory with at least one space in
              the name, replace every space by an underscore and  display  the
              commands executed.

              For more complete examples and other implementation details, see
              the zmv source file, usually located in one of  the  directories
              named in your fpath, or in Functions/Misc/zmv in the zsh distri-
              bution.

       zstyle+ context style value [ + subcontext style value ... ]
              This makes defining styles a bit simpler by using a  single  `+'
              as  a  special token that allows you to append a context name to
              the previously used context name.  Like this:

                     zstyle+ ':foo:bar' style1 value1 \
                            +':baz'     style2 value2 \
                            +':frob'    style3 value3

              This defines style1 with value1  for  the  context  :foo:bar  as
              usual,  but  it  also defines style2 with value2 for the context
              :foo:bar:baz and style3 with value3 for :foo:bar:frob.  Any sub-
              context  may  be  the  empty  string to re-use the first context
              unchanged.


   Styles
       insert-tab
              The zed function sets this style in context  `:completion:zed:*'
              to  turn  off completion when TAB is typed at the beginning of a
              line.  You may override this by setting your own value for  this
              context and style.

       pager  The  nslookup  function  looks  up  this  style  in  the context
              `:nslookup' to determine the program used to display output that
              does not fit on a single screen.

       prompt
       rprompt
              The  nslookup  function  looks  up  this  style  in  the context
              `:nslookup' to set the prompt and the right-side prompt, respec-
              tively.   The  usual  expansions for the PS1 and RPS1 parameters
              may be used (see EXPANSION OF PROMPT SEQUENCES in zshmisc(1)).
