SEQ(1)                    BSD General Commands Manual                   SEQ(1)

NAME
     seq -- print sequences of numbers

SYNOPSIS
     seq [-w] [-f format] [-s string] [-t string] [first [incr]] last

DESCRIPTION
     The seq utility prints a sequence of numbers, one per line (default),
     from first (default 1), to near last as possible, in increments of incr
     (default 1).  When first is larger than last the default incr is -1.

     All numbers are interpreted as floating point.

     Normally integer values are printed as decimal integers.

     The seq utility accepts the following options:

     -f format     Use a printf(3) style format to print each number.  Only
                   the E, e, f, G, g, and % conversion characters are valid,
                   along with any optional flags and an optional numeric mini-
                   mum field width or precision.  The format can contain char-
                   acter escape sequences in backslash notation as defined in
                   ANSI X3.159-1989 (``ANSI C89'').  The default is %g.

     -s string     Use string to separate numbers.  The string can contain
                   character escape sequences in backslash notation as defined
                   in ANSI X3.159-1989 (``ANSI C89'').  The default is \n.

     -t string     Use string to terminate sequence of numbers.  The string
                   can contain character escape sequences in backslash nota-
                   tion as defined in ANSI X3.159-1989 (``ANSI C89'').  This
                   option is useful when the default separator does not con-
                   tain a \n.

     -w            Equalize the widths of all numbers by padding with zeros as
                   necessary.  This option has no effect with the -f option.
                   If any sequence numbers will be printed in exponential
                   notation, the default conversion is changed to %e.

     The seq utility exits 0 on success and non-zero if an error occurs.

EXAMPLES
           # seq 1 3
           1
           2
           3

           # seq 3 1
           3
           2
           1

           # seq -w 0 .05 .1
           0.00
           0.05
           0.10

HISTORY
     The seq command first appeared in Plan 9 from Bell Labs.  A seq command
     appeared in NetBSD 3.0, and ported to FreeBSD 9.0.  This command was
     based on the command of the same name in Plan 9 from Bell Labs and the
     GNU core utilities.  The GNU seq command first appeared in the 1.13 shell
     utilities release.

BUGS
     The -w option does not handle the transition from pure floating point to
     exponent representation very well.  The seq command is not bug for bug
     compatible with the Plan 9 from Bell Labs or GNU versions of seq.
