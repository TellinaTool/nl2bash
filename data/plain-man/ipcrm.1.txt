DESCRIPTION
     Ipcrm removes the specified message queues, semaphores and shared memory
     segments.  These System V IPC objects can be specified by their creation
     id or any associated key.

     The following options are used to specify which IPC objects will be

     -M shmkey
             Mark the shared memory segment associated with key shmkey for
             removal.  This marked segment will be destroyed after the last
             detach.

     -m shmid
             Mark the shared memory segment associated with id shmid for
             removal.  This marked segment will be destroyed after the last
             detach.

     -Q msgkey
             Remove the message queue associated with key msgkey from the sys-
             tem.

     -q msqid
             Remove the message queue associated with the id msqid from the
             system.

     -S semkey
             Remove the semaphore set associated with key semkey from the sys-
             tem.

     -s semid
             Removes the semaphore set associated with id semid from the sys-
             tem.

     The identifiers and keys associated with these System V IPC objects can
     be determined by using ipcs(1)
