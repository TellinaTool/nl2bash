NTP-KEYGEN(1)                 Programmer's Manual                NTP-KEYGEN(1)



NAME
       ntp-keygen - Create a NTP host key

SYNOPSIS
       ntp-keygen [-flag [value]]... [--opt-name [[=| ]value]]...

       All arguments must be options.

DESCRIPTION
       This manual page briefly documents the ntp-keygen command.  If there is
       no new host key, look for an existing one.  If one is not found, create
       it.

OPTIONS
       -c scheme, --certificate=scheme
              certificate scheme.

              scheme  is one of RSA-MD2, RSA-MD5, RSA-SHA, RSA-SHA1, RSA-MDC2,
              RSA-RIPEMD160, DSA-SHA, or DSA-SHA1.

              Select  the  certificate  message  digest/signature   encryption
              scheme.   Note that RSA schemes must be used with a RSA sign key
              and DSA schemes must be used with a DSA sign key.   The  default
              without this option is RSA-MD5.

       -d, --debug-level
              Increase  output debug message level.  This option may appear an
              unlimited number of times.

              Increase the debugging message output level.

       -D string, --set-debug-level=string
              Set the output debug message level.  This option may  appear  an
              unlimited number of times.

              Set the output debugging level.  Can be supplied multiple times,
              but each overrides the previous value(s).

       -e, --id-key
              Write IFF or GQ identity keys.

              Write the IFF or GQ client keys to the standard output.  This is
              intended for automatic key distribution by mail.

       -G, --gq-params
              Generate GQ parameters and keys.

              Generate  parameters  and keys for the GQ identification scheme,
              obsoleting any that may exist.

       -H, --host-key
              generate RSA host key.

              Generate new host keys, obsoleting any that may exist.

       -I, --iffkey
              generate IFF parameters.

              Generate parameters for the IFF identification scheme,  obsolet-
              ing any that may exist.

       -i issuer-name, --issuer-name=issuer-name
              set issuer name.

              Set  the suject name to name.  This is used as the subject field
              in certificates and in the file name for host and sign keys.

       -M, --md5key
              generate MD5 keys.

              Generate MD5 keys, obsoleting any that may exist.

       -m modulus, --modulus=modulus
              modulus.  This option takes an integer number as  its  argument.
              The value of modulus is constrained to being:
                  in the range  256 through 2048

              The number of bits in the prime modulus.  The default is 512.

       -P, --pvt-cert
              generate PC private certificate.

              Generate a private certificate.  By default, the program gener-
              ates public certificates.

       -p passwd, --pvt-passwd=passwd
              output private password.

              Encrypt generated files containing private data with the speci-
              fied password and the DES-CBC algorithm.

       -q passwd, --get-pvt-passwd=passwd
              input private password.

              Set the password for reading files to the specified password.

       -S sign, --sign-key=sign
              generate sign key (RSA or DSA).

              Generate a new sign key of the designated type, obsoleting any
              that may exist.  By default, the program uses the host key as
              the sign key.

       -s host, --subject-name=host
              set subject name.

              Set the issuer name to name.  This is used for the issuer field
              in certificates and in the file name for identity files.

       -T, --trusted-cert
              trusted certificate (TC scheme).

              Generate a trusted certificate.  By default, the program gener-
              ates a non-trusted certificate.

       -V num, --mv-params=num
              generate <num> MV parameters.  This option takes an integer num-
              ber as its argument.

              Generate parameters and keys for the Mu-Varadharajan (MV) iden-
              tification scheme.

       -v num, --mv-keys=num
              update <num> MV keys.  This option takes an integer number as
              its argument.

              This option has not been fully documented.

       -?, --help
              Display extended usage information and exit.

       -!, --more-help
              Extended usage information passed thru pager.

       -> [rcfile], --save-opts[=rcfile]
              Save the option state to rcfile.  The default is the last con-
              figuration file listed in the OPTION PRESETS section, below.

       -< rcfile, --load-opts=rcfile, --no-load-opts
              Load options from rcfile.  The no-load-opts form will disable
              the loading of earlier RC/INI files.  --no-load-opts is handled
              early, out of order.

       - [{v|c|n}], --version[={v|c|n}]
              Output version of program and exit.  The default mode is `v', a
              simple version.  The `c' mode will print copyright information
              and `n' will print the full copyright notice.

OPTION PRESETS
       Any option that is not marked as not presettable may be preset by load-
       ing values from configuration ("RC" or ".INI") file(s) and values from
       environment variables named:
         NTP_KEYGEN_<option-name> or NTP_KEYGEN
       The  environmental  presets  take precedence (are processed later than)
       the configuration files.  The homerc files are "$HOME",  and  ".".   If
       any  of  these  are  directories,  then the file .ntprc is searched for
       within those directories.
