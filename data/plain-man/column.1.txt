COLUMN(1)                 BSD General Commands Manual                COLUMN(1)

NAME
     column -- columnate lists

SYNOPSIS
     column [-tx] [-c columns] [-s sep] [file ...]

DESCRIPTION
     The column utility formats its input into multiple columns.  Rows are
     filled before columns.  Input is taken from file operands, or, by
     default, from the standard input.  Empty lines are ignored.

     The options are as follows:

     -c      Output is formatted for a display columns wide.

     -s      Specify a set of characters to be used to delimit columns for the
             -t option.

     -t      Determine the number of columns the input contains and create a
             table.  Columns are delimited with whitespace, by default, or
             with the characters supplied using the -s option.  Useful for
             pretty-printing displays.

     -x      Fill columns before filling rows.

ENVIRONMENT
     The COLUMNS, LANG, LC_ALL and LC_CTYPE environment variables affect the
     execution of column as described in environ(7).

EXIT STATUS
     The column utility exits 0 on success, and >0 if an error occurs.

EXAMPLES
           (printf "PERM LINKS OWNER GROUP SIZE MONTH DAY " ; \
           printf "HH:MM/YEAR NAME\n" ; \
           ls -l | sed 1d) | column -t
