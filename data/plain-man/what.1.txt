WHAT(1)                   BSD General Commands Manual                  WHAT(1)

NAME
     what -- show what versions of object modules were used to construct a
     file

SYNOPSIS
     what name ...

DESCRIPTION
     what reads each file name and searches for sequences of the form
     ``@(#)'', as inserted by the source code control system.  It prints the
     remainder of the string following this marker, up to a null character,
     newline, double quote, or ``> character.''

BUGS
     As BSD is not licensed to distribute SCCS.  This is a rewrite of the what
     command which is part of SCCS; it may not behave in exactly the same man-
     ner as that command does.

HISTORY
     The what command appeared in 4.0BSD.

4th Berkeley Distribution        June 6, 1993        4th Berkeley Distribution
