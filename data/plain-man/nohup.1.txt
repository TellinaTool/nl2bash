NOHUP(1)                  BSD General Commands Manual                 NOHUP(1)

NAME
     nohup -- invoke a utility immune to hangups

SYNOPSIS
     nohup [--] utility [arguments]

DESCRIPTION
     The nohup utility invokes utility with its arguments and at this time
     sets the signal SIGHUP to be ignored.  If the standard output is a termi-
     nal, the standard output is appended to the file nohup.out in the current
     directory.  If standard error is a terminal, it is directed to the same
     place as the standard output.

     Some shells may provide a builtin nohup command which is similar or iden-
     tical to this utility.  Consult the builtin(1) manual page.

ENVIRONMENT
     The following variables are utilized by nohup:

     HOME  If the output file nohup.out cannot be created in the current
           directory, the nohup utility uses the directory named by HOME to
           create the file.

     PATH  Used to locate the requested utility if the name contains no `/'
           characters.

EXIT STATUS
     The nohup utility exits with one of the following values:

     126     The utility was found, but could not be invoked.

     127     The utility could not be found or an error occurred in nohup.

     Otherwise, the exit status of nohup will be that of utility.

SEE ALSO
     builtin(1), csh(1), signal(3)

STANDARDS
     The nohup utility is expected to be IEEE Std 1003.2 (``POSIX.2'') compat-
     ible.

BUGS
     Two or more instances of nohup can append to the same file, which makes
     for a confusing output.
