NAME
     uuidgen -- generates new UUID strings

SYNOPSIS
     uuidgen [-hdr]

DESCRIPTION
     The uuidgen command generates a Universally Unique IDentifier (UUID), a
     128-bit value guaranteed to be unique over both space and time.

     The following options are available:

     -hdr      Emit CoreFoundation CFUUID-based source code for using the uuid
               in a header.

RETURN VALUE
     The UUID is printed to standard output as a hyphen-punctuated ASCII
     string of the form: EEF45689-BBE5-4FB6-9E80-41B78F6578E2 (in printf(3)
     format "%08X-%04X-%04X-%04X-%012X"), unless the -hdr option is given, in
     which case a fragment of source code is output.
