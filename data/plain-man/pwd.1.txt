PWD(1)                    BSD General Commands Manual                   PWD(1)

NAME
     pwd -- return working directory name

SYNOPSIS
     pwd [-L | -P]

DESCRIPTION
     The pwd utility writes the absolute pathname of the current working
     directory to the standard output.

     Some shells may provide a builtin pwd command which is similar or identi-
     cal to this utility.  Consult the builtin(1) manual page.

     The options are as follows:

     -L      Display the logical current working directory.

     -P      Display the physical current working directory (all symbolic
             links resolved).

     If no options are specified, the -L option is assumed.

ENVIRONMENT
     Environment variables used by pwd:

     PWD  Logical current working directory.

EXIT STATUS
     The pwd utility exits 0 on success, and >0 if an error occurs.

SEE ALSO
     builtin(1), cd(1), csh(1), sh(1), getcwd(3)

STANDARDS
     The pwd utility conforms to IEEE Std 1003.1-2001 (``POSIX.1'').

BUGS
     In csh(1) the command dirs is always faster because it is built into that
     shell.  However, it can give a different answer in the rare case that the
     current directory or a containing directory was moved after the shell
     descended into it.

     The -L option does not work unless the PWD environment variable is
     exported by the shell.
