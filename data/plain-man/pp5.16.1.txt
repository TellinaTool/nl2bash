NAME
       pp - PAR Packager

SYNOPSIS
       pp [ -ABCEFILMPTSVXacdefghilmnoprsvxz ] [ parfile | scriptfile ]...

EXAMPLES
       Note: When running on Microsoft Windows, the a.out below will be
       replaced by a.exe instead.

           % pp hello.pl               # Pack 'hello.pl' into executable 'a.out'
           % pp -o hello hello.pl      # Pack 'hello.pl' into executable 'hello'
                                       # (or 'hello.exe' on Win32)

           % pp -o foo foo.pl bar.pl   # Pack 'foo.pl' and 'bar.pl' into 'foo'
           % ./foo                     # Run 'foo.pl' inside 'foo'
           % mv foo bar; ./bar         # Run 'bar.pl' inside 'foo'
           % mv bar baz; ./baz         # Error: Can't open perl script "baz"

           % pp -p file                # Creates a PAR file, 'a.par'
           % pp -o hello a.par         # Pack 'a.par' to executable 'hello'
           % pp -S -o hello file       # Combine the two steps above

           % pp -p -o out.par file     # Creates 'out.par' from 'file'
           % pp -B -p -o out.par file  # same as above, but bundles core modules
                                       # and removes any local paths from @INC
           % pp -P -o out.pl file      # Creates 'out.pl' from 'file'
           % pp -B -p -o out.pl file   # same as above, but bundles core modules
                                       # and removes any local paths from @INC
                                       # (-B is assumed when making executables)

           % pp -e "print 123"         # Pack a one-liner into 'a.out'
           % pp -p -e "print 123"      # Creates a PAR file 'a.par'
           % pp -P -e "print 123"      # Creates a perl script 'a.pl'

           % pp -c hello               # Check dependencies from "perl -c hello"
           % pp -x hello               # Check dependencies from "perl hello"
           % pp -n -x hello            # same as above, but skips static scanning

           % pp -I /foo hello          # Extra include paths
           % pp -M Foo::Bar hello      # Extra modules in the include path
           % pp -M abbrev.pl hello     # Extra libraries in the include path
           % pp -X Foo::Bar hello      # Exclude modules
           % pp -a data.txt hello      # Additional data files

           % pp -r hello               # Pack 'hello' into 'a.out', runs 'a.out'
           % pp -r hello a b c         # Pack 'hello' into 'a.out', runs 'a.out'
                                       # with arguments 'a b c'

           % pp hello --log=c          # Pack 'hello' into 'a.out', logs
                                       # messages into 'c'

           # Pack 'hello' into a console-less 'out.exe' with icon (Win32 only)
           % pp --gui --icon hello.ico -o out.exe hello

           % pp @file hello.pl         # Pack 'hello.pl' but read _additional_
                                       # options from file 'file'

DESCRIPTION
       pp creates standalone executables from Perl programs, using the
       compressed packager provided by PAR, and dependency detection
       heuristics offered by Module::ScanDeps.  Source files are compressed
       verbatim without compilation.

       You may think of pp as "perlcc that works without hassle". :-)

       A GUI interface is also available as the tkpp command.

       It does not provide the compilation-step acceleration provided by
       perlcc (however, see -f below for byte-compiled, source-hiding
       techniques), but makes up for it with better reliability, smaller
       executable size, and full retrieval of original source code.

       When a single input program is specified, the resulting executable will
       behave identically as that program.  However, when multiple programs
       are packaged, the produced executable will run the one that has the
       same basename as $0 (i.e. the filename used to invoke it).  If nothing
       matches, it dies with the error "Can't open perl script "$0"".

OPTIONS
       Options are available in a short form and a long form.  For example,
       the three lines below are all equivalent:

           % pp -o output.exe input.pl
           % pp --output output.exe input.pl
           % pp --output=output.exe input.pl

       Since the command lines can become sufficiently long to reach the
       limits imposed by some shells, it is possible to have pp read some of
       its options from one or more text files. The basic usage is to just
       include an argument starting with an 'at' (@) sigil. This argument will
       be interpeted as a file to read options from. Mixing ordinary options
       and @file options is possible. This is implemented using the
       Getopt::ArgvFile module, so read its documentation for advanced usage.

       -a, --addfile=FILE|DIR
           Add an extra file into the package.  If the file is a directory,
           recursively add all files inside that directory, with links turned
           into actual files.

           By default, files are placed under "/" inside the package with
           their original names.  You may override this by appending the
           target filename after a ";", like this:

               % pp -a "old_filename.txt;new_filename.txt"
               % pp -a "old_dirname;new_dirname"

           You may specify "-a" multiple times.

       -A, --addlist=FILE
           Read a list of file/directory names from FILE, adding them into the
           package.  Each line in FILE is taken as an argument to -a above.

           You may specify "-A" multiple times.

       -B, --bundle
           Bundle core modules in the resulting package.  This option is
           enabled by default, except when "-p" or "-P" is specified.

           Since PAR version 0.953, this also strips any local paths from the
           list of module search paths @INC before running the contained
           script.

       -C, --clean
           Clean up temporary files extracted from the application at runtime.
           By default, these files are cached in the temporary directory; this
           allows the program to start up faster next time.

       -c, --compile
           Run "perl -c inputfile" to determine additonal run-time
           dependencies.

       -cd, --cachedeps=FILE
           Use FILE to cache detected dependencies. Creates FILE unless
           present. This will speed up the scanning process on subsequent
           runs.

       -d, --dependent
           Reduce the executable size by not including a copy of perl
           interpreter.  Executables built this way will need a separate
           perl5x.dll or libperl.so to function correctly.  This option is
           only available if perl is built as a shared library.

       -e, --eval=STRING
           Package a one-liner, much the same as "perl -e '...'"

       -E, --evalfeature=STRING
           Behaves just like "-e", except that it implicitly enables all
           optional features (in the main compilation unit) with Perl 5.10 and
           later.  See feature.

       -x, --execute
           Run "perl inputfile" to determine additonal run-time dependencies.

       -X, --exclude=MODULE
           Exclude the given module from the dependency search path and from
           the package. If the given file is a zip or par or par executable,
           all the files in the given file (except MANIFEST, META.yml and
           script/*) will be excluded and the output file will "use" the given
           file at runtime.

       -f, --filter=FILTER
           Filter source script(s) with a PAR::Filter subclass.  You may
           specify multiple such filters.

           If you wish to hide the source code from casual prying, this will
           do:

               % pp -f Bleach source.pl

           If you are more serious about hiding your source code, you should
           have a look at Steve Hay's PAR::Filter::Crypto module. Make sure
           you understand the Filter::Crypto caveats!

       -g, --gui
           Build an executable that does not have a console window. This
           option is ignored on non-MSWin32 platforms or when "-p" is
           specified.

       -h, --help
           Show basic usage information.

       -i, --icon=FILE
           Specify an icon file (in .ico, .exe or .dll format) for the
           executable. This option is ignored on non-MSWin32 platforms or when
           "-p" is specified.

       -N, --info=KEY=VAL
           Add additional information for the packed file, both in "META.yml"
           and in the executable header (if applicable).  The name/value pair
           is joined by "=".  You may specify "-N" multiple times, or use ";"
           to link several pairs.

           For Win32 executables, these special "KEY" names are recognized:

               Comments        CompanyName     FileDescription FileVersion
               InternalName    LegalCopyright  LegalTrademarks OriginalFilename
               ProductName     ProductVersion

       -I, --lib=DIR
           Add the given directory to the perl library file search path.  May
           be specified multiple times.

       -l, --link=FILE|LIBRARY
           Add the given shared library (a.k.a. shared object or DLL) into the
           packed file.  Also accepts names under library paths; i.e.  "-l
           ncurses" means the same thing as "-l libncurses.so" or "-l
           /usr/local/lib/libncurses.so" in most Unixes.  May be specified
           multiple times.

       -L, --log=FILE
           Log the output of packaging to a file rather than to stdout.

       -F, --modfilter=FILTER[=REGEX],
           Filter included perl module(s) with a PAR::Filter subclass.  You
           may specify multiple such filters.

           By default, the PodStrip filter is applied.  In case that causes
           trouble, you can turn this off by setting the environment variable
           "PAR_VERBATIM" to 1.

           Since PAR 0.958, you can use an optional regular expression (REGEX
           above) to select the files in the archive which should be filtered.
           Example:

             pp -o foo.exe -F Bleach=warnings\.pm$ foo.pl

           This creates a binary executable foo.exe from foo.pl packaging all
           files as usual except for files ending in "warnings.pm" which are
           filtered with PAR::Filter::Bleach.

       -M, --module=MODULE
           Add the specified module into the package, along with its
           dependencies.  Also accepts filenames relative to the @INC path;
           i.e. "-M Module::ScanDeps" means the same thing as "-M
           Module/ScanDeps.pm".

           If MODULE has an extension that is not ".pm"/".ix"/".al", it will
           not be scanned for dependencies, and will be placed under "/"
           instead of "/lib/" inside the PAR file.  This use is deprecated --
           consider using the -a option instead.

           You may specify "-M" multiple times.

       -m, --multiarch
           Build a multi-architecture PAR file.  Implies -p.

       -n, --noscan
           Skip the default static scanning altogether, using run-time
           dependencies from -c or -x exclusively.

       -o, --output=FILE
           File name for the final packaged executable.

       -p, --par
           Create PAR archives only; do not package to a standalone binary.

       -P, --perlscript
           Create stand-alone perl script; do not package to a standalone
           binary.

       -r, --run
           Run the resulting packaged script after packaging it.

       --reusable
           EXPERIMENTAL

           Make the packaged executable reusable for running arbitrary,
           external Perl scripts as if they were part of the package:

             pp -o myapp --reusable someapp.pl
             ./myapp --par-options --reuse otherapp.pl

           The second line will run otherapp.pl instead of someapp.pl.

       -S, --save
           Do not delete generated PAR file after packaging.

       -s, --sign
           Cryptographically sign the generated PAR or binary file using
           Module::Signature.

       -T, --tempcache
           Set the program unique part of the cache directory name that is
           used if the program is run without -C. If not set, a hash of the
           executable is used.

           When the program is run, its contents are extracted to a temporary
           directory.  On Unix systems, this is commonly
           /tmp/par-USERNAME/cache-XXXXXXX.  USERNAME is replaced by the user
           running the program, and XXXXXXX is either a hash of the executable
           or the value passed to the "-T" or "--tempcache" switch.

       -v, --verbose[=NUMBER]
           Increase verbosity of output; NUMBER is an integer from 1 to 3, 3
           being the most verbose.  Defaults to 1 if specified without an
           argument.  Alternatively, -vv sets verbose level to 2, and -vvv
           sets it to 3.

       -V, --version
           Display the version number and copyrights of this program.

       -z, --compress=NUMBER
           Set zip compression level; NUMBER is an integer from 0 to 9, 0 = no
           compression, 9 = max compression.  Defaults to 6 if -z is not used.

ENVIRONMENT
       PP_OPTS
           Command-line options (switches).  Switches in this variable are
           taken as if they were on every pp command line.

NOTES
       Here are some recipes showing how to utilize pp to bundle source.pl
       with all its dependencies, on target machines with different expected
       settings:

       Stone-alone setup:
           To make a stand-alone executable, suitable for running on a machine
           that doesn't have perl installed:

               % pp -o packed.exe source.pl        # makes packed.exe
               # Now, deploy 'packed.exe' to target machine...
               $ packed.exe                        # run it

       Perl interpreter only, without core modules:
           To make a packed .pl file including core modules, suitable for
           running on a machine that has a perl interpreter, but where you
           want to be sure of the versions of the core modules that your
           program uses:

               % pp -B -P -o packed.pl source.pl   # makes packed.pl
               # Now, deploy 'packed.pl' to target machine...
               $ perl packed.pl                    # run it

       Perl with core modules installed:
           To make a packed .pl file without core modules, relying on the
           target machine's perl interpreter and its core libraries.  This
           produces a significantly smaller file than the previous version:

               % pp -P -o packed.pl source.pl      # makes packed.pl
               # Now, deploy 'packed.pl' to target machine...
               $ perl packed.pl                    # run it

       Perl with PAR.pm and its dependencies installed:
           Make a separate archive and executable that uses the archive. This
           relies upon the perl interpreter and libraries on the target
           machine.

               % pp -p source.pl                   # makes source.par
               % echo "use PAR 'source.par';" > packed.pl;
               % cat source.pl >> packed.pl;       # makes packed.pl
               # Now, deploy 'source.par' and 'packed.pl' to target machine...
               $ perl packed.pl                    # run it, perl + core modules required

       Note that even if your perl was built with a shared library, the
       'Stand-alone executable' above will not need a separate perl5x.dll or
       libperl.so to function correctly.  But even in this case, the
       underlying system libraries such as libc must be compatible between the
       host and target machines.  Use "--dependent" if you are willing to ship
       the shared library with the application, which can significantly reduce
       the executable size.
