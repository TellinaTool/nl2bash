NAME
       eyapp - A Perl front-end to the Parse::Eyapp module

SYNOPSYS
           eyapp [options] grammar[.eyp]
           eyapp -V
           eyapp -h

               grammar     The grammar file. If no suffix is given, and the file
                           does not exists, .eyp is added

DESCRIPTION
       The eyapp compiler is a front-end to the Parse::Eyapp module, which
       lets you compile Parse::Eyapp grammar input files into Perl LALR(1)
       Object Oriented parser modules.

OPTIONS IN DETAIL
       -v  Creates a file grammar.output describing your parser. It will show
           you a summary of conflicts, rules, the DFA (Deterministic Finite
           Automaton) states and overall usage of the parser.

           Implies option "-N". To produce a more detailed description of the
           states, the LALR tables aren't compacted.  Use the combination
           "-vN" to produce an  ".output" file corresponding to the compacted
           tables.

       -s  Create a standalone module in which the parsing driver is included.
           The modules including the LALR driver (Parse::Eyapp::Driver), those
           for AST manipulations (Parse::Eyapp::Node and Parse::Eyapp::YATW))
           and Parse::Eyapp::Base are included - almost verbatim - inside the
           generated module.

           Note that if you have more than one parser module called from a
           program, to have it standalone, you need this option only for one
           of your grammars;

       -n  Disable source file line numbering embedded in your parser module.
           I don't know why one should need it, but it's there.

       -m module
           Gives your parser module the package name (or name space or module
           name or class name or whatever-you-call-it) of module.  It defaults
           to grammar

       -o outfile
           The compiled output file will be named outfile for your parser
           module.  It defaults to grammar.pm or, if you specified the option
           -m A::Module::Name (see below), to Name.pm.

       -c grammar[.eyp]
           Produces as output (STDOUT) the grammar without the actions. Only
           the syntactic parts are displayed. Comments will be also stripped
           if the "-v" option is added.

       -t filename
           The -t filename option allows you to specify a file which should be
           used as template for generating the parser output.  The default is
           to use the internal template defined in Parse::Eyapp::Output.pm.
           For how to write your own template and which substitutions are
           available, have a look to the module Parse::Eyapp::Output.pm : it
           should be obvious.

       -b shebang
           If you work on systems that understand so called shebangs, and your
           generated parser is directly an executable script, you can specify
           one with the -b option, ie:

               eyapp -b '/usr/local/bin/perl -w' -o myscript.pl myscript.yp

           This will output a file called myscript.pl whose very first line
           is:

               #!/usr/local/bin/perl -w

           The argument is mandatory, but if you specify an empty string, the
           value of $Config{perlpath} will be used instead.

       -B prompt
           Adds a modulino call '__PACKAGE->main(<prompt>) unless caller();'
           as the very last line of the output file. The argument is
           mandatory.

       -C grammar.eyp
           An abbreviation for the combined use of -b '' and  -B ''

       -T grammar.eyp
           Equivalent to %tree.

       -N grammar.eyp
           Equivalent to the directive %nocompact. Do not compact LALR action
           tables.

       -l  Do not provide a default lexical analyzer. By default "eyapp"
           builds a lexical analyzer from your "%token = /regexp/" definitions

       grammar
           The input grammar file. If no suffix is given, and the file does
           not exists, an attempt to open the file with a suffix of  .eyp is
           tried before exiting.

       -V  Display current version of Parse::Eyapp and gracefully exits.

       -h  Display the usage screen.

EXAMPLE
       The following "eyapp" program translates an infix expression like
       "2+3*4" to postfix: "2 3 4 * +"

           %token NUM = /([0-9]+(?:\.[0-9]+)?)/
           %token VAR = /([A-Za-z][A-Za-z0-9_]*)/

           %right  '='
           %left   '-' '+'
           %left   '*' '/'
           %left   NEG

           %defaultaction { "$left $right $op"; }

           %%
           line: $exp  { print "$exp\n" }
           ;

           exp:        $NUM  { $NUM }
                   |   $VAR  { $VAR }
                   |   VAR.left '='.op exp.right
                   |   exp.left '+'.op exp.right
                   |   exp.left '-'.op exp.right
                   |   exp.left '*'.op exp.right
                   |   exp.left '/'.op exp.right
                   |   '-' $exp %prec NEG { "$exp NEG" }
                   |   '(' $exp ')' { $exp }
           ;

           %%

       Notice that there is no need to write lexer and error report
       subroutines.  First, we compile the grammar:

           pl@nereida:~/LEyapp/examples/eyappintro$ eyapp -o postfix.pl -C Postfix.eyp

       If we use the "-C" option and no "main()" was written one default
       "main" sub is provided.  We can now execute the resulting program:

           pl@nereida:~/LEyapp/examples/eyappintro$ ./postfix.pl -c 'a = 2*3 +b'
           a 2 3 * b + =

       When a non conformant input is given, it produces an accurate error
       message:

           pl@nereida:~/LEyapp/examples/eyappintro$ ./postfix.pl -c 'a = 2**3 +b'

           Syntax error near '*'.
           Expected one of these terminals: '-' 'NUM' 'VAR' '('
           There were 1 errors during parsing
