NAME
       perldebguts - Guts of Perl debugging

DESCRIPTION
       This is not perldebug, which tells you how to use the debugger.  This
       manpage describes low-level details concerning the debugger's
       internals, which range from difficult to impossible to understand for
       anyone who isn't incredibly intimate with Perl's guts.  Caveat lector.

Debugger Internals
       Perl has special debugging hooks at compile-time and run-time used to
       create debugging environments.  These hooks are not to be confused with
       the perl -Dxxx command described in perlrun, which is usable only if a
       special Perl is built per the instructions in the INSTALL podpage in
       the Perl source tree.

       For example, whenever you call Perl's built-in "caller" function from
       the package "DB", the arguments that the corresponding stack frame was
       called with are copied to the @DB::args array.  These mechanisms are
       enabled by calling Perl with the -d switch.  Specifically, the
       following additional features are enabled (cf. "$^P" in perlvar):

       o   Perl inserts the contents of $ENV{PERL5DB} (or "BEGIN {require
           'perl5db.pl'}" if not present) before the first line of your
           program.

       o   Each array "@{"_<$filename"}" holds the lines of $filename for a
           file compiled by Perl.  The same is also true for "eval"ed strings
           that contain subroutines, or which are currently being executed.
           The $filename for "eval"ed strings looks like "(eval 34)".

           Values in this array are magical in numeric context: they compare
           equal to zero only if the line is not breakable.

       o   Each hash "%{"_<$filename"}" contains breakpoints and actions keyed
           by line number.  Individual entries (as opposed to the whole hash)
           are settable.  Perl only cares about Boolean true here, although
           the values used by perl5db.pl have the form
           "$break_condition\0$action".

           The same holds for evaluated strings that contain subroutines, or
           which are currently being executed.  The $filename for "eval"ed
           strings looks like "(eval 34)".

       o   Each scalar "${"_<$filename"}" contains "_<$filename".  This is
           also the case for evaluated strings that contain subroutines, or
           which are currently being executed.  The $filename for "eval"ed
           strings looks like "(eval 34)".

       o   After each "require"d file is compiled, but before it is executed,
           "DB::postponed(*{"_<$filename"})" is called if the subroutine
           "DB::postponed" exists.  Here, the $filename is the expanded name
           of the "require"d file, as found in the values of %INC.

       o   After each subroutine "subname" is compiled, the existence of
           $DB::postponed{subname} is checked.  If this key exists,
           "DB::postponed(subname)" is called if the "DB::postponed"
           subroutine also exists.

       o   A hash %DB::sub is maintained, whose keys are subroutine names and
           whose values have the form "filename:startline-endline".
           "filename" has the form "(eval 34)" for subroutines defined inside
           "eval"s.

       o   When the execution of your program reaches a point that can hold a
           breakpoint, the "DB::DB()" subroutine is called if any of the
           variables $DB::trace, $DB::single, or $DB::signal is true.  These
           variables are not "local"izable.  This feature is disabled when
           executing inside "DB::DB()", including functions called from it
           unless "$^D & (1<<30)" is true.

       o   When execution of the program reaches a subroutine call, a call to
           &DB::sub(args) is made instead, with $DB::sub holding the name of
           the called subroutine. (This doesn't happen if the subroutine was
           compiled in the "DB" package.)

       Note that if &DB::sub needs external data for it to work, no subroutine
       call is possible without it. As an example, the standard debugger's
       &DB::sub depends on the $DB::deep variable (it defines how many levels
       of recursion deep into the debugger you can go before a mandatory
       break).  If $DB::deep is not defined, subroutine calls are not
       possible, even though &DB::sub exists.

   Writing Your Own Debugger
       Environment Variables

       The "PERL5DB" environment variable can be used to define a debugger.
       For example, the minimal "working" debugger (it actually doesn't do
       anything) consists of one line:

         sub DB::DB {}

       It can easily be defined like this:

         $ PERL5DB="sub DB::DB {}" perl -d your-script

       Another brief debugger, slightly more useful, can be created with only
       the line:

         sub DB::DB {print ++$i; scalar <STDIN>}

       This debugger prints a number which increments for each statement
       encountered and waits for you to hit a newline before continuing to the
       next statement.

       The following debugger is actually useful:

         {
           package DB;
           sub DB  {}
           sub sub {print ++$i, " $sub\n"; &$sub}
         }

       It prints the sequence number of each subroutine call and the name of
       the called subroutine.  Note that &DB::sub is being compiled into the
       package "DB" through the use of the "package" directive.

       When it starts, the debugger reads your rc file (./.perldb or ~/.perldb
       under Unix), which can set important options.  (A subroutine
       (&afterinit) can be defined here as well; it is executed after the
       debugger completes its own initialization.)

       After the rc file is read, the debugger reads the PERLDB_OPTS
       environment variable and uses it to set debugger options. The contents
       of this variable are treated as if they were the argument of an "o ..."
       debugger command (q.v. in "Configurable Options" in perldebug).

       Debugger Internal Variables

       In addition to the file and subroutine-related variables mentioned
       above, the debugger also maintains various magical internal variables.

       o   @DB::dbline is an alias for "@{"::_<current_file"}", which holds
           the lines of the currently-selected file (compiled by Perl), either
           explicitly chosen with the debugger's "f" command, or implicitly by
           flow of execution.

           Values in this array are magical in numeric context: they compare
           equal to zero only if the line is not breakable.

       o   %DB::dbline is an alias for "%{"::_<current_file"}", which contains
           breakpoints and actions keyed by line number in the currently-
           selected file, either explicitly chosen with the debugger's "f"
           command, or implicitly by flow of execution.

           As previously noted, individual entries (as opposed to the whole
           hash) are settable.  Perl only cares about Boolean true here,
           although the values used by perl5db.pl have the form
           "$break_condition\0$action".

       Debugger Customization Functions

       Some functions are provided to simplify customization.

       o   See "Configurable Options" in perldebug for a description of
           options parsed by "DB::parse_options(string)".

       o   "DB::dump_trace(skip[,count])" skips the specified number of frames
           and returns a list containing information about the calling frames
           (all of them, if "count" is missing).  Each entry is reference to a
           hash with keys "context" (either ".", "$", or "@"), "sub"
           (subroutine name, or info about "eval"), "args" ("undef" or a
           reference to an array), "file", and "line".

       o   "DB::print_trace(FH, skip[, count[, short]])" prints formatted info
           about caller frames.  The last two functions may be convenient as
           arguments to "<", "<<" commands.

       Note that any variables and functions that are not documented in this
       manpages (or in perldebug) are considered for internal use only, and as
       such are subject to change without notice.

Frame Listing Output Examples
       The "frame" option can be used to control the output of frame
       information.  For example, contrast this expression trace:

        $ perl -de 42
        Stack dump during die enabled outside of evals.

        Loading DB routines from perl5db.pl patch level 0.94
        Emacs support available.

        Enter h or 'h h' for help.

        main::(-e:1):   0
          DB<1> sub foo { 14 }

          DB<2> sub bar { 3 }

          DB<3> t print foo() * bar()
        main::((eval 172):3):   print foo() + bar();
        main::foo((eval 168):2):
        main::bar((eval 170):2):
        42

       with this one, once the "o"ption "frame=2" has been set:

          DB<4> o f=2
                       frame = '2'
          DB<5> t print foo() * bar()
        3:      foo() * bar()
        entering main::foo
         2:     sub foo { 14 };
        exited main::foo
        entering main::bar
         2:     sub bar { 3 };
        exited main::bar
        42

       By way of demonstration, we present below a laborious listing resulting
       from setting your "PERLDB_OPTS" environment variable to the value "f=n
       N", and running perl -d -V from the command line.  Examples using
       various values of "n" are shown to give you a feel for the difference
       between settings.  Long though it may be, this is not a complete
       listing, but only excerpts.

       In all cases shown above, the line indentation shows the call tree.  If
       bit 2 of "frame" is set, a line is printed on exit from a subroutine as
       well.  If bit 4 is set, the arguments are printed along with the caller
       info.  If bit 8 is set, the arguments are printed even if they are tied
       or references.  If bit 16 is set, the return value is printed, too.

       When a package is compiled, a line like this

           Package lib/Carp.pm.

       is printed with proper indentation.

Debugging Regular Expressions
       There are two ways to enable debugging output for regular expressions.

       If your perl is compiled with "-DDEBUGGING", you may use the -Dr flag
       on the command line.

       Otherwise, one can "use re 'debug'", which has effects at compile time
       and run time.  Since Perl 5.9.5, this pragma is lexically scoped.

   Compile-time Output
       The debugging output at compile time looks like this:

         Compiling REx '[bc]d(ef*g)+h[ij]k$'

       The first line shows the pre-compiled form of the regex.  The second

       words) and the total number of bytes allocated for the offset/length
       table, usually 4+"size"*8.  The next line shows the label id of the
       first node that does a match.

       substring "de" at offset 1, plus substring "gh" at some offset between
       3 and infinity.  Moreover, when checking for these substrings (to
       abandon impossible matches quickly), Perl will check for the substring
       "gh" before checking for the substring "de".  The optimizer may also
       use the knowledge that the match starts (at the "first" id) with a
       character class, and no string shorter than 7 characters can possibly
       match.

       The fields of interest which may appear in this line are

       "anchored" STRING "at" POS
       "floating" STRING "at" POS1..POS2
           See above.

       "matching floating/anchored"
           Which substring to check first.

       "minlen"
           The minimal length of the match.

       "stclass" TYPE
           Type of first matching node.

       "noscan"
           Don't scan for the found substrings.

       "isall"
           Means that the optimizer information is all that the regular
           expression contains, and thus one does not need to enter the regex
           engine at all.

       "GPOS"
           Set if the pattern contains "\G".

       "plus"
           Set if the pattern starts with a repeated char (as in "x+y").

       "implicit"
           Set if the pattern starts with ".*".

       "with eval"
           Set if the pattern contain eval-groups, such as "(?{ code })" and
           "(??{ code })".

       "anchored(TYPE)"
           If the pattern may match only at a handful of places, with "TYPE"
           being "BOL", "MBOL", or "GPOS".  See the table below.

       If a substring is known to match at end-of-line only, it may be
       followed by "$", as in "floating 'k'$".

       The optimizer-specific information is used to avoid entering (a slow)
       regex engine on strings that will not definitely match.  If the "isall"
       flag is set, a call to the regex engine may be avoided even when the
       optimizer found an appropriate place for the match.

       Above the optimizer section is the list of nodes of the compiled form
       of the regex.  Each line has format

       "   "id: TYPE OPTIONAL-INFO (next-id)

   Types of Nodes

       The first line here indicates that the offset/length table contains 45
       entries.  Each entry is a pair of integers, denoted by
       "offset[length]".  Entries are numbered starting with 1, so entry #1
       here is "1[4]" and entry #12 is "5[1]".  "1[4]" indicates that the node
       labeled "1:" (the "1: ANYOF[bc]") begins at character position 1 in the
       pre-compiled form of the regex, and has a length of 4 characters.
       "5[1]" in position 12 indicates that the node labeled "12:" (the "12:
       EXACT <d>") begins at character position 5 in the pre-compiled form of
       the regex, and has a length of 1 character.  "12[1]" in position 14
       indicates that the node labeled "14:" (the "14: CURLYX[0] {1,32767}")
       begins at character position 12 in the pre-compiled form of the regex,
       and has a length of 1 character---that is, it corresponds to the "+"
       symbol in the precompiled regex.

       "0[0]" items indicate that there is no corresponding node.

   Run-time Output
       First of all, when doing a match, one may get no run-time output even
       if debugging is enabled.  This means that the regex engine was never
       entered and that all of the job was therefore done by the optimizer.

       If the regex engine was entered, the output may look like this:

         Matching '[bc]d(ef*g)+h[ij]k$' against 'abcdefg__gh__'
           Setting an EVAL scope, savestack=3

       The most significant information in the output is about the particular
       node of the compiled regex that is currently being tested against the
       target string.  The format of these lines is

       "    "STRING-OFFSET <PRE-STRING> <POST-STRING>   |ID:  TYPE

       The TYPE info is indented with respect to the backtracking level.
       Other incidental information appears interspersed within.

Debugging Perl Memory Usage
       Perl is a profligate wastrel when it comes to memory use.  There is a
       saying that to estimate memory usage of Perl, assume a reasonable
       algorithm for memory allocation, multiply that estimate by 10, and
       while you still may miss the mark, at least you won't be quite so
       astonished.  This is not absolutely true, but may provide a good grasp
       of what happens.

       Assume that an integer cannot take less than 20 bytes of memory, a
       float cannot take less than 24 bytes, a string cannot take less than 32
       bytes (all these examples assume 32-bit architectures, the result are
       quite a bit worse on 64-bit architectures).  If a variable is accessed
       in two of three different ways (which require an integer, a float, or a
       string), the memory footprint may increase yet another 20 bytes.  A
       sloppy malloc(3) implementation can inflate these numbers dramatically.

       On the opposite end of the scale, a declaration like

         sub foo;

       may take up to 500 bytes of memory, depending on which release of Perl
       you're running.

       Anecdotal estimates of source-to-compiled code bloat suggest an
       eightfold increase.  This means that the compiled form of reasonable
       (normally commented, properly indented etc.) code will take about eight
       times more space in memory than the code took on disk.

       The -DL command-line switch is obsolete since circa Perl 5.6.0 (it was
       available only if Perl was built with "-DDEBUGGING").  The switch was
       used to track Perl's memory allocations and possible memory leaks.
       These days the use of malloc debugging tools like Purify or valgrind is
       suggested instead.  See also "PERL_MEM_LOG" in perlhacktips.

       One way to find out how much memory is being used by Perl data
       structures is to install the Devel::Size module from CPAN: it gives you
       the minimum number of bytes required to store a particular data
       structure.  Please be mindful of the difference between the size() and
       total_size().

       If Perl has been compiled using Perl's malloc you can analyze Perl
       memory usage by setting $ENV{PERL_DEBUG_MSTATS}.

   Using $ENV{PERL_DEBUG_MSTATS}
       If your perl is using Perl's malloc() and was compiled with the
       necessary switches (this is the default), then it will print memory
       usage statistics after compiling your code when
       "$ENV{PERL_DEBUG_MSTATS} > 1", and before termination of the program
       when "$ENV{PERL_DEBUG_MSTATS} >= 1".  The report format is similar to
       the following example:

         $ PERL_DEBUG_MSTATS=2 perl -e "require Carp"
         Memory allocation statistics after compilation: (buckets 4(4)..8188(8192)
            14216 free:   130   117    28     7     9   0   2     2   1 0 0
                       437    61    36     0     5
            60924 used:   125   137   161    55     7   8   6    16   2 0 1
                        74   109   304    84    20
         Total sbrk(): 77824/21:119. Odd ends: pad+heads+chain+tail: 0+636+0+2048.
         Memory allocation statistics after execution:   (buckets 4(4)..8188(8192)
            30888 free:   245    78    85    13     6   2   1     3   2 0 1
                       315   162    39    42    11
           175816 used:   265   176  1112   111    26  22  11    27   2 1 1
                       196   178  1066   798    39
         Total sbrk(): 215040/47:145. Odd ends: pad+heads+chain+tail: 0+2192+0+6144.

       It is possible to ask for such a statistic at arbitrary points in your
       execution using the mstat() function out of the standard Devel::Peek
       module.

       Here is some explanation of that format:

       "buckets SMALLEST(APPROX)..GREATEST(APPROX)"
           Perl's malloc() uses bucketed allocations.  Every request is
           rounded up to the closest bucket size available, and a bucket is
           taken from the pool of buckets of that size.

           The line above describes the limits of buckets currently in use.
           Each bucket has two sizes: memory footprint and the maximal size of
           user data that can fit into this bucket.  Suppose in the above
           example that the smallest bucket were size 4.  The biggest bucket
           would have usable size 8188, and the memory footprint would be
           8192.

           In a Perl built for debugging, some buckets may have negative
           usable size.  This means that these buckets cannot (and will not)
           be used.  For larger buckets, the memory footprint may be one page
           greater than a power of 2.  If so, the corresponding power of two
           is printed in the "APPROX" field above.

       Free/Used
           The 1 or 2 rows of numbers following that correspond to the number
           of buckets of each size between "SMALLEST" and "GREATEST".  In the
           first row, the sizes (memory footprints) of buckets are powers of
           two--or possibly one page greater.  In the second row, if present,
           the memory footprints of the buckets are between the memory
           footprints of two buckets "above".

           For example, suppose under the previous example, the memory
           footprints were

                free:    8     16    32    64    128  256 512 1024 2048 4096 8192
                      4     12    24    48    80

           With a non-"DEBUGGING" perl, the buckets starting from 128 have a
           4-byte overhead, and thus an 8192-long bucket may take up to
           8188-byte allocations.

       "Total sbrk(): SBRKed/SBRKs:CONTINUOUS"
           The first two fields give the total amount of memory perl sbrk(2)ed
           (ess-broken? :-) and number of sbrk(2)s used.  The third number is
           what perl thinks about continuity of returned chunks.  So long as
           this number is positive, malloc() will assume that it is probable
           that sbrk(2) will provide continuous memory.

           Memory allocated by external libraries is not counted.

       "pad: 0"
           The amount of sbrk(2)ed memory needed to keep buckets aligned.

       "heads: 2192"
           Although memory overhead of bigger buckets is kept inside the
           bucket, for smaller buckets, it is kept in separate areas.  This
           field gives the total size of these areas.

       "chain: 0"
           malloc() may want to subdivide a bigger bucket into smaller
           buckets.  If only a part of the deceased bucket is left
           unsubdivided, the rest is kept as an element of a linked list.
           This field gives the total size of these chunks.

       "tail: 6144"
           To minimize the number of sbrk(2)s, malloc() asks for more memory.
           This field gives the size of the yet unused part, which is
           sbrk(2)ed, but never touched.
