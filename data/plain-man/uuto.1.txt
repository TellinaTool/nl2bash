NAME
       uuto - send files to a particular user on a remote system

SYNOPSIS
       uuto files... system!user

DESCRIPTION
       The uuto program may be used to conveniently send files to a particular
       user on a remote system.  It will arrange for mail to be  sent  to  the
       remote  user  when the files arrive on the remote system, and he or she
       may easily retrieve the files using the uupick program.  Note that uuto
       does  not provide any security--any user on the remote system can exam-
       ine the files.

       The last argument specifies the system and user name to which  to  send
       the  files.   The  other  arguments  are the files or directories to be
       sent.

       The uuto program is actually just a trivial shell script which  invokes
       the uucp program with the appropriate arguments.

OPTIONS
       Any option which may be given to uucp may also be given to uuto.
