kill.d(1m)                       USER COMMANDS                      kill.d(1m)



NAME
       kill.d - snoop process signals as they occur. Uses DTrace.

SYNOPSIS
       kill.d

DESCRIPTION
       kill.d  is  a simple DTrace program to print details of process signals
       as they are sent, such as the PID source and destination, signal number
       and result.

       This  program can be used to determine which process is sending signals
       to which other process.

       Since this uses DTrace, only users with root privileges  can  run  this
       command.

EXAMPLES
       Default output, print process signals as they are sent.
              # kill.d


FIELDS
       FROM   source PID

       COMMAND
              source command name

       TO     destination PID

       SIG    destination signal ("9" for a kill -9)

       RESULT result of signal (-1 is for failure)

DOCUMENTATION
       See  the  DTraceToolkit for further documentation under the Docs direc-
       tory. The DTraceToolkit docs may include full worked examples with ver-
       bose descriptions explaining the output.

EXIT
       kill.d will run forever until Ctrl-C is hit.
