atos(1)                   BSD General Commands Manual                  atos(1)

NAME
     atos -- convert numeric addresses to symbols of binary images or pro-
     cesses

SYNOPSIS
     atos [-o <binary-image-file>] [-p <pid> | <partial-executable-name>]
          [-arch architecture] [-l <load-address>] [-s <slide>] [-printHeader]
          [-f <address-input-file>] [<address> ...]

DESCRIPTION
     The atos command converts numeric addresses to their symbolic equiva-
     lents.  If full debug symbol information is available, for example in a
     .app.dSYM sitting beside a .app, then the output of atos will include
     file name and source line number information.

     The input addresses may be given in one of three ways:

     1.   A list of addresses at the end of the argument list.

     2.   Using the -f <address-input-file> argument to specify the path of an
          input file containing whitespace-separated numeric addresses.

     3.   If no addresses were directly specified, atos enters an interactive
          mode, reading addresses from stdin.

     The symbols are found in either a binary image file or in a currently
     executing process, as specified by:

     -o <binary-image-file>
             The path to a binary image file in which to look up symbols.

     -p <pid> | <partial-executable-name>
             The process ID or the partial name of a currently executing
             process in which to look up symbols.

     Multiple process IDs or paths can be specified if necessary, and the two
     can be mixed in any order.  When working with a Mach-O binary image file,
     atos considers only addresses and symbols defined in that binary image
     file, at their default locations (unless the -l or -s option is given).
     When working with a running process, atos considers addresses and symbols
     defined in all binary images currently loaded by that process, at their
     loaded locations.

     The following additional options are available.

     -arch architecture
             The particular architecure of a binary image file in which to
             look up symbols.

     -l <load-address>
             The load address of the binary image.  This value is always
             assumed to be in hex, even without a "0x" prefix.  The input
             addresses are assumed to be in a binary image with that load
             address.  Load addresses for binary images can be found in the
             Binary Images: section at the bottom of crash, sample, leaks, and
             malloc_history reports.

     -s <slide>
             The slide value of the binary image -- this is the difference
             between the load address of a binary image, and the address at
             which the binary image was built.  This slide value is subtracted
             from the input addresses.  It is usually easier to directly spec-
             ify the load address with the -l argument than to manually calcu-
             late a slide value.

     -printHeader
             If a process was specified, the first line of atos output should
             be a header of the form "Looking up symbols in process <pid>
             named:  <process-name>".  This is primarily used when atos is
             invoked as part of a stackshot(1) run, for verification of the
             process ID and name.

EXAMPLE
     A stripped, optimized version of Sketch was built as an x86_64 position-
     independent executable (PIE) into /BuildProducts/Release.  Full debug
     symbol information is available in Sketch.app.dSYM, which sits alongside
     Sketch.app.  When Sketch.app was run, the Sketch binary (which was built
     at 0x100000000) was loaded at 0x10acde000.  Running 'sample Sketch'
     showed 3 addresses that we want to get symbol information for --
     0x10acea1d3, 0x10ace4bea, and 0x10ace4b7a.

     First notice that the .dSYM is next to the .app:

     % ls -1 /BuildProducts/Release/
     Sketch.app
     Sketch.app.dSYM

     Now, to symbolicate, we run atos with the -o flag specifying the path to
     the actual Sketch executable (not the .app wrapper), the -arch x86_64
     flag, and the -l 0x10acde000 flag to specify the load address.

     % atos -o /BuildProducts/Release/Sketch.app/Contents/MacOS/Sketch -arch x86_64 -l 0x10acde000  0x10acea1d3 0x10ace4bea 0x10ace4b7a
     -[SKTGraphicView drawRect:] (in Sketch) (SKTGraphicView.m:445)
     -[SKTGraphic drawHandlesInView:] (in Sketch) (NSGeometry.h:110)
     -[SKTGraphic drawHandleInView:atPoint:] (in Sketch) (SKTGraphic.m:490)

GETTING SYMBOLS FOR A DIFFERENT MACHINE ARCHITECTURE
     It is possible to get symbols for addresses from a different machine
     architecture than the system on which atos is running.  For example, when
     running atos on an Intel-based system, one may wish to get the symbol for
     an address that came from a backtrace of a process running on an ARM
     device.  To do so, use the -arch flag to specify the desired architecture
     (such as i386 or arm) and pass in a corresponding symbol-rich Mach-O
     binary image file with a binary image of the corresponding architecture
     (such as a Universal Binary).
