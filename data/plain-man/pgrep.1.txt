PKILL(1)                  BSD General Commands Manual                 PKILL(1)

NAME
     pgrep, pkill -- find or signal processes by name

SYNOPSIS
     pgrep [-Lafilnoqvx] [-F pidfile] [-G gid] [-P ppid] [-U uid] [-d delim]
           [-g pgrp] [-t tty] [-u euid] pattern ...
     pkill [-signal] [-ILafilnovx] [-F pidfile] [-G gid] [-P ppid] [-U uid]
           [-g pgrp] [-t tty] [-u euid] pattern ...

DESCRIPTION
     The pgrep command searches the process table on the running system and
     prints the process IDs of all processes that match the criteria given on
     the command line.

     The pkill command searches the process table on the running system and
     signals all processes that match the criteria given on the command line.

     The following options are available:

     -F pidfile  Restrict matches to a process whose PID is stored in the
                 pidfile file.

     -G gid      Restrict matches to processes with a real group ID in the
                 comma-separated list gid.

     -I          Request confirmation before attempting to signal each
                 process.

     -L          The pidfile file given for the -F option must be locked with
                 the flock(2) syscall or created with pidfile(3).

     -P ppid     Restrict matches to processes with a parent process ID in the
                 comma-separated list ppid.

     -U uid      Restrict matches to processes with a real user ID in the
                 comma-separated list uid.

     -d delim    Specify a delimiter to be printed between each process ID.
                 The default is a newline.  This option can only be used with
                 the pgrep command.

     -a          Include process ancestors in the match list.  By default, the
                 current pgrep or pkill process and all of its ancestors are
                 excluded (unless -v is used).

     -f          Match against full argument lists.  The default is to match
                 against process names.

     -g pgrp     Restrict matches to processes with a process group ID in the
                 comma-separated list pgrp.  The value zero is taken to mean
                 the process group ID of the running pgrep or pkill command.

     -i          Ignore case distinctions in both the process table and the
                 supplied pattern.

     -l          Long output.  For pgrep, print the process name in addition
                 to the process ID for each matching process.  If used in con-
                 junction with -f, print the process ID and the full argument
                 list for each matching process.  For pkill, display the kill
                 command used for each process killed.

     -n          Select only the newest (most recently started) of the match-
                 ing processes.

     -o          Select only the oldest (least recently started) of the match-
                 ing processes.

     -q          Do not write anything to standard output.

     -t tty      Restrict matches to processes associated with a terminal in
                 the comma-separated list tty.  Terminal names may be of the
                 form ttyxx or the shortened form xx.  A single dash (`-')
                 matches processes not associated with a terminal.

     -u euid     Restrict matches to processes with an effective user ID in
                 the comma-separated list euid.

     -v          Reverse the sense of the matching; display processes that do
                 not match the given criteria.

     -x          Require an exact match of the process name, or argument list
                 if -f is given.  The default is to match any substring.

     -signal     A non-negative decimal number or symbolic signal name speci-
                 fying the signal to be sent instead of the default TERM.
                 This option is valid only when given as the first argument to
                 pkill.

     If any pattern operands are specified, they are used as regular expres-
     sions to match the command name or full argument list of each process.

     Note that a running pgrep or pkill process will never consider itself as
     a potential match.

EXIT STATUS
     The pgrep and pkill utilities return one of the following values upon
     exit:

     0       One or more processes were matched.

     1       No processes were matched.

     2       Invalid options were specified on the command line.

     3       An internal error occurred.

HISTORY
     The pkill and pgrep utilities first appeared in NetBSD 1.6.  They are
     modelled after utilities of the same name that appeared in Sun Solaris 7.
     They made their first appearance in FreeBSD 5.3.
