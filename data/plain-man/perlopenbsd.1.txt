NAME
       perlopenbsd - Perl version 5 on OpenBSD systems

DESCRIPTION
       This document describes various features of OpenBSD that will affect
       how Perl version 5 (hereafter just Perl) is compiled and/or runs.

   OpenBSD core dumps from getprotobyname_r and getservbyname_r with ithreads
       When Perl is configured to use ithreads, it will use re-entrant library
       calls in preference to non-re-entrant versions.  There is an
       incompatibility in OpenBSD's "getprotobyname_r" and "getservbyname_r"
       function in versions 3.7 and later that will cause a SEGV when called
       without doing a "bzero" on their return structs prior to calling these
       functions.  Current Perl's should handle this problem correctly.  Older
       threaded Perls (5.8.6 or earlier) will run into this problem.  If you
       want to run a threaded Perl on OpenBSD 3.7 or higher, you will need to
       upgrade to at least Perl 5.8.7.
