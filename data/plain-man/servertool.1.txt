servertool(1)                                                    servertool(1)



NAME
       servertool - The Java(TM) IDL Server Tool

       servertool  provides  an ease-of-use interface for application program-
       mers to register, unregister, startup and shutdown a server.

SYNOPSIS
       servertool -ORBInitialPort nameServerPort [ options ]

       The command-line tool displays with a servertool > prompt.  Enter  com-
       mands at the servertool > prompt.

       The  -ORBInitialPort  nameServerPort option is required.  The value for
       nameServerPort must specify the port on which orbd is running and  lis-
       tening  for incoming requests.  You must become root to start a process
       on a port under 1024. For this reason, we recommend that you use a port
       number greater than or equal to 1024 for the nameServerPort.

DESCRIPTION
       The  servertool provides the command-line interface for the application
       programmers to register, unregister, startup, and  shutdown  a  server.
       Other  commands  are provided to obtain various statistical information
       about the server.

OPTIONS
       -ORBInitialHost nameServerHost
              Specifies the host machine on which the name server  is  running
              and listening for incoming requests. The nameServerHost defaults
              to localhost if this  option  is  not  specified.  If  orbd  and
              servertool  are  running on different machines, you must specify
              the name or IP address of the host on which orbd is running.

       -Joption
              Pass option to the Java virtual machine, where option is one  of
              the  options described on the reference page for the java appli-
              cation launcher.  For example, -J-Xms48m sets the startup memory
              to  48  megabytes.  It  is  a  common  convention for -J to pass
              options to the underlying virtual machine.

COMMANDS
       register
              -server serverClassName -classpath classpathToServer [ -applica-
              tionName alternateServerName -args argsToServer -vmargs flagsTo-
              BePassedToJavaVM ]

              Register a new server with  the  Object  Request  Broker  Daemon
              (ORBD).   If  the server is not already registered, it is regis-
              tered and activated.  This command causes an install  method  to
              be  invoked  in  the  main class of the server identified by the
              -server option. The install method must be  public  static  void
              install(org.omg.CORBA.ORB).   The install method is optional and
              enables the developer to provide their own  server  installation
              behavior (for example, creating database schema).

       unregister
              -serverid serverId | -applicationName name

              Unregister  a server from the ORBD by using either its server id
              or its application  name.   This  command  causes  an  uninstall
              method  to be invoked in the main class of the server identified
              by the -server option.  The  uninstall  method  must  be  public
              static  void  uninstall(org.omg.CORBA.ORB). The uninstall method
              is optional and enables  the  developer  to  provide  their  own
              server  uninstall behavior (for example, undoing the behavior of
              the install method).

       getserverid
              -applicationName applicationName

              Return the server id that corresponds with an application.

       list
              List all information about  all  persistent  servers  registered
              with the ORBD.

       listappnames
              List  the  application names for all server currently registered
              with the ORBD.

       listactive
              List all information about all persistent servers that have been
              launched by the ORBD and are currently running.

       locate
              -serverid  serverId  |  -applicationName applicationName [ -end-
              pointType endpointType ]

              Locate the endpoints (ports) of a specific  type  for  all  ORBs
              created  by a registered server. If a server is not already run-
              ning, it is activated. If an endpoint  type  is  not  specified,
              then  the  plain/non-protected endpoint associated with each ORB
              in a server is returned.

       locateperorb
              -serverid serverId | -applicationName applicationName  [  -orbid
              ORB_name ]

              Locate all the endpoints (ports) registered by a specific ORB of
              registered server. If a server is not already running,  then  it
              is activated. If an orbid is not specified, the default value of
              "" is assigned to the orbid.  If any ORBs are  created  with  an
              orbid  of empty string, all ports registered by it are returned.

       orblist
              -serverid serverId | -applicationName applicationName ]

              Lists the ORBId of the ORBs defined on a server.   An  ORBId  is
              the string name for the ORB created by the server. If the server
              is not already running, it is activated.

       shutdown
              -serverid serverId | -applicationName applicationName ]

              Shutdown an  active server that is registered with ORBD.  During
              execution  of this command, the shutdown() method defined in the
              the class specified by either the -serverid or  -applicationName
              parameter  is also invoked to shutdown the server process appro-
              priately.

       startup
              -serverid serverId | -applicationName applicationName

              Startup or activate a server that is registered with  ORBD.   If
              the  server is not running, this command launches the server. If
              the server is already running, an error message is  returned  to
              the user.

       help
              List all the commands available to the server through the server
              tool.

       quit
              Exit the server tool.
