DESCRIPTION
       By default, the postconf(1) command displays the values of main.cf con-
       figuration parameters, and warns  about  possible  mis-typed  parameter
       names  (Postfix  2.9 and later).  It can also change main.cf configura-
       tion parameter values, or display other configuration information about
       the Postfix mail system.

       Options:

       -a     List  the available SASL server plug-in types.  The SASL plug-in
              type is selected with the smtpd_sasl_type configuration  parame-
              ter by specifying one of the names listed below.

              cyrus  This  server  plug-in  is available when Postfix is built
                     with Cyrus SASL support.

              dovecot
                     This  server  plug-in  uses  the  Dovecot  authentication
                     server,  and  is available when Postfix is built with any
                     form of SASL support.

              This feature is available with Postfix 2.3 and later.

       -A     List the available SASL client plug-in types.  The SASL  plug-in
              type  is selected with the smtp_sasl_type or lmtp_sasl_type con-
              figuration parameters by specifying  one  of  the  names  listed
              below.

              cyrus  This  client  plug-in  is available when Postfix is built
                     with Cyrus SASL support.

              This feature is available with Postfix 2.3 and later.

       -b [template_file]
              Display the message text that appears at the beginning of deliv-
              ery  status notification (DSN) messages, replacing $name expres-
              sions with actual values as described in bounce(5).

              To override the built-in templates, specify a template file name
              at  the  end  of the postconf(1) command line, or specify a file
              name in main.cf with the bounce_template_file parameter.

              To force selection of the built-in templates, specify  an  empty
              template  file  name  on  the postconf(1) command line (in shell
              language: "").

              This feature is available with Postfix 2.3 and later.

       -c config_dir
              The main.cf configuration file is in the named directory instead
              of the default configuration directory.

       -C class,...
              When  displaying main.cf parameters, select only parameters from
              the specified class(es):

              builtin
                     Parameters with built-in names.

              service
                     Parameters with service-defined names (the first field of
                     a master.cf entry plus a Postfix-defined suffix).

              user   Parameters with user-defined names.

              all    All the above classes.

              The default is as if "-C all" is specified.

       -d     Print  main.cf default parameter settings instead of actual set-
              tings.  Specify -df to fold long  lines  for  human  readability
              (Postfix 2.9 and later).

       -e     Edit  the  main.cf configuration file, and update parameter set-
              tings with the "name=value" pairs  on  the  postconf(1)  command
              line.

              With  -M, edit the master.cf configuration file, and replace one
              or more service entries with new values as specified with  "ser-
              vice/type=value" on the postconf(1) command line.

              With  -F, edit the master.cf configuration file, and replace one
              or more service fields with new values  as  specied  with  "ser-
              vice/type/field=value"  on  the  postconf(1)  command line. Cur-
              rently, the "command" field contains the command name  and  com-
              mand arguments.  this may change in the near future, so that the
              "command" field contains only the command name, and a new "argu-
              ments" pseudofield contains the command arguments.

              With  -P,  edit  the  master.cf  configuration  file, and add or
              update one  or  more  service  parameter  settings  (-o  parame-
              ter=value  settings)  with  new  values  as  specied  with "ser-
              vice/type/parameter=value" on the postconf(1) command line.

              In all cases the file is copied to a temporary file then renamed
              into  place.   Specify  quotes to protect special characters and
              whitespace on the postconf(1) command line.

              The -e option is no longer needed with Postfix version  2.8  and
              later.

       -f     Fold long lines when printing main.cf or master.cf configuration
              file entries, for human readability.

              This feature is available with Postfix 2.9 and later.

       -F     Show master.cf per-entry field settings (by default all services
              and all fields), formatted as one "service/type/field=value" per
              line. Specify -Ff to fold long lines.

              Specify one or more "service/type/field" instances on the  post-
              conf(1)  command line to limit the output to fields of interest.
              Trailing parameter name or service type fields that are  omitted
              will be handled as "*" wildcard fields.

              This feature is available with Postfix 2.11 and later.

       -h     Show  parameter  or attribute values without the "name = " label
              that normally precedes the value.

       -l     List the names of all supported mailbox locking methods.   Post-
              fix supports the following methods:

              flock  A  kernel-based  advisory  locking method for local files
                     only.  This locking method is available on systems with a
                     BSD compatible library.

              fcntl  A  kernel-based  advisory  locking  method  for local and
                     remote files.

              dotlock
                     An application-level locking method. An application locks
                     a  file  named  filename  by  creating a file named file-
                     name.lock.  The application is expected to remove its own
                     lock  file,  as  well  as stale lock files that were left
                     behind after abnormal program termination.

       -m     List the names of all supported lookup table types.  In  Postfix
              configuration  files,  lookup tables are specified as type:name,
              where type is one of the types listed below. The table name syn-
              tax  depends  on the lookup table type as described in the DATA-
              BASE_README document.

              btree  A sorted, balanced tree structure.  Available on  systems
                     with support for Berkeley DB databases.

              cdb    A  read-optimized structure with no support for incremen-
                     tal updates.  Available on systems with support  for  CDB
                     databases.

              cidr   A  table  that  associates  values  with Classless Inter-
                     Domain Routing (CIDR)  patterns.  This  is  described  in
                     cidr_table(5).

              dbm    An indexed file type based on hashing.  Available on sys-
                     tems with support for DBM databases.

              environ
                     The UNIX process environment array. The lookup key is the
                     variable  name. Originally implemented for testing, some-
                     one may find this useful someday.

              fail   A table that reliably fails all requests. The lookup  ta-
                     ble  name  is used for logging. This table exists to sim-
                     plify Postfix error tests.

              hash   An indexed file type based on hashing.  Available on sys-
                     tems with support for Berkeley DB databases.

              internal
                     A  non-shared, in-memory hash table. Its content are lost
                     when a process terminates.

              lmdb   OpenLDAP  LMDB  database  (a  memory-mapped,   persistent
                     file).   Available on systems with support for LMDB data-
                     bases.  This is described in lmdb_table(5).

              ldap (read-only)
                     LDAP database client. This is described in ldap_table(5).

              memcache
                     Memcache  database  client.  This  is  described  in mem-
                     cache_table(5).

              mysql (read-only)
                     MySQL database client.  Available on systems with support
                     for  MySQL  databases.   This  is  described in mysql_ta-
                     ble(5).

              pcre (read-only)
                     A lookup table based on Perl Compatible  Regular  Expres-
                     sions.  The file format is described in pcre_table(5).

              pgsql (read-only)
                     PostgreSQL   database   client.   This  is  described  in
                     pgsql_table(5).

              proxy  Postfix proxymap(8) client for shared access  to  Postfix
                     databases. The table name syntax is type:name.

              regexp (read-only)
                     A  lookup  table  based  on regular expressions. The file
                     format is described in regexp_table(5).

              sdbm   An indexed file type based on hashing.  Available on sys-
                     tems with support for SDBM databases.

              socketmap (read-only)

              sqlite (read-only)
                     SQLite database. This is described in sqlite_table(5).

              static (read-only)
                     A table that always returns its name  as  lookup  result.
                     For example, static:foobar always returns the string foo-
                     bar as lookup result.

              tcp (read-only)
                     TCP/IP client. The protocol is described in tcp_table(5).

              texthash (read-only)
                     Produces  similar results as hash: files, except that you
                     don't need to run the postmap(1) command before  you  can
                     use  the  file, and that it does not detect changes after
                     the file is read.

              unix (read-only)
                     A limited view of the UNIX authentication  database.  The
                     following tables are implemented:

                     unix:passwd.byname
                            The  table  is the UNIX password database. The key
                            is a login name.  The result is  a  password  file
                            entry in passwd(5) format.

                     unix:group.byname
                            The table is the UNIX group database. The key is a
                            group name.  The result is a group file  entry  in
                            group(5) format.

              Other  table types may exist depending on how Postfix was built.

       -M     Show master.cf file contents instead of main.cf  file  contents.
              Specify -Mf to fold long lines for human readability.

              Specify zero or more arguments, each with a service-name or ser-
              vice-name/service-type pair, where  service-name  is  the  first
              field  of  a  master.cf  entry and service-type is one of (inet,
              unix, fifo, or pass).

              If service-name or service-name/service-type is specified,  only
              the  matching  master.cf  entries  will  be output. For example,
              "postconf -Mf smtp" will output all services named  "smtp",  and
              "postconf  -Mf smtp/inet" will output only the smtp service that
              listens on the network.  Trailing service type fields  that  are
              omitted will be handled as "*" wildcard fields.

              This feature is available with Postfix 2.9 and later. The syntax
              was changed from "name.type" to "name/type",  and  "*"  wildcard
              support was added with Postfix 2.11.

       -n     Show only configuration parameters that have explicit name=value
              settings in main.cf.  Specify -nf to fold long lines  for  human
              readability (Postfix 2.9 and later).

       -o name=value
              Override main.cf parameter settings.

              This feature is available with Postfix 2.10 and later.

       -p     Show main.cf parameter settings. This is the default.

       -P     Show  master.cf  service parameter settings (by default all ser-
              vices   and   all   parameters).    formatted   as   one   "ser-
              vice/type/parameter=value"  per  line.  Specify -Pf to fold long
              lines.

              Specify one or more "service/type/parameter"  instances  on  the
              postconf(1)  command  line  to limit the output to parameters of
              interest.  Trailing parameter name or service type  fields  that
              are omitted will be handled as "*" wildcard fields.

              This feature is available with Postfix 2.11 and later.

       -t [template_file]
              Display  the templates for text that appears at the beginning of
              delivery status notification (DSN) messages,  without  expanding
              $name expressions.

              To override the built-in templates, specify a template file name
              at the end of the postconf(1) command line, or  specify  a  file
              name in main.cf with the bounce_template_file parameter.

              To  force  selection of the built-in templates, specify an empty
              template file name on the postconf(1)  command  line  (in  shell
              language: "").

              This feature is available with Postfix 2.3 and later.

       -v     Enable  verbose  logging  for  debugging  purposes.  Multiple -v
              options make the software increasingly verbose.

       -x     Expand $name in  main.cf  or  master.cf  parameter  values.  The
              expansion is recursive.

              This feature is available with Postfix 2.10 and later.

       -X     Edit  the  main.cf configuration file, and remove the parameters
              named on the postconf(1) command line.  Specify a list of param-
              eter names, not "name=value" pairs.

              With  -M,  edit the master.cf configuration file, and remove one
              or more service entries as specified with "service/type" on  the
              postconf(1) command line.

              With  -P,  edit the master.cf configuration file, and remove one
              or more service parameter settings (-o parameter=value settings)
              as specied with "service/type/parameter" on the postconf(1) com-
              mand line.

              In all cases the file is copied to a temporary file then renamed
              into place.  Specify quotes to protect special characters on the
              postconf(1) command line.

              There is no postconf(1) command to perform  the  reverse  opera-
              tion.

              This  feature is available with Postfix 2.10 and later.  Support
              for -M and -P was added with Postfix 2.11.

       -#     Edit the main.cf configuration file, and comment out the parame-
              ters named on the postconf(1) command line, so that those param-
              eters revert to their default values.  Specify a list of parame-
              ter names, not "name=value" pairs.

              With  -M, edit the master.cf configuration file, and comment out
              one or more service entries as specified with "service/type"  on
              the postconf(1) command line.

              In all cases the file is copied to a temporary file then renamed
              into place.  Specify quotes to protect special characters on the
              postconf(1) command line.

              There  is  no  postconf(1) command to perform the reverse opera-
              tion.

              This feature is available with Postfix 2.6  and  later.  Support
              for -M was added with Postfix 2.11.
