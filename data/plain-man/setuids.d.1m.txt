NAME
       setuids.d - snoop setuid calls as they occur. Uses DTrace.

SYNOPSIS
       setuids.d

DESCRIPTION
       setuids.d  is a simple DTrace program to print details of setuid calls,
       where a process assumes a different UID. These are usually  related  to
       login events.

       Since  this  uses  DTrace, only users with root privileges can run this
       command.

              # setuids.d
