NAME
       cpuwalk.d - Measure which CPUs a process runs on. Uses DTrace.

SYNOPSIS
       cpuwalk.d [duration]

DESCRIPTION
       This  program  is  for  multi-CPU  servers,  and can help identify if a
       process is running on multiple CPUs concurrently or not.

       A duration may be specified in seconds.

       Since this uses DTrace, only users with root privileges  can  run  this
       command.

EXAMPLES
       this runs until Ctrl-C is hit,
              # cpuwalk.d


       run for 5 seconds,
              # cpuwalk.d 5


FIELDS
       PID    process ID

       CMD    process name

       value  CPU id

       count  number of samples (sample at 100 hz)


DOCUMENTATION
       See  the  DTraceToolkit for further documentation under the Docs direc-
       tory. The DTraceToolkit docs may include full worked examples with ver-
       bose descriptions explaining the output.

EXIT
       cpuwalk.d  will  run  until Ctrl-C is hit, or the duration specified is
       reached.
