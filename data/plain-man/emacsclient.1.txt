EMACSCLIENT(1)                                                  EMACSCLIENT(1)



NAME
       emacsclient - tells a running Emacs to visit a file

SYNOPSIS
       emacsclient [options] files ...

DESCRIPTION
       This manual page documents briefly the emacsclient command.  Full docu-
       mentation is available in the GNU Info format; see below.  This  manual
       page  was originally written for the Debian GNU/Linux distribution, but
       is not specific to that system.

       emacsclient works in conjunction with the built-in Emacs server.

       You can either call emacsclient directly or let other programs  run  it
       for  you when necessary.  On GNU and Unix systems many programs consult
       the environment variable EDITOR (sometimes also VISUAL) to  obtain  the
       command  used  for editing.  Thus, setting this environment variable to
       'emacsclient' will allow these programs to use an already running Emacs
       for  editing.  Other operating systems might have their own methods for
       defining the default editor.

       For emacsclient to work, you need  an  already  running  Emacs  with  a
       server.   Within  Emacs,  call the functions `server-start' or `server-
       mode'.  (Your `.emacs' file can do this automatically if you add either
       `(server-start)' or `(server-mode 1)' to it.)

       When  you've finished editing the buffer, type `C-x #' (`server-edit').
       This saves the file and sends a message back to the `emacsclient'  pro-
       gram  telling  it to exit.  The programs that use `EDITOR' wait for the
       "editor" (actually, `emacsclient') to exit.  `C-x #'  also  checks  for
       other  pending external requests to edit various files, and selects the
       next such file.

       If you set the variable `server-window' to a window or a frame, `C-x #'
       displays the server buffer in that window or in that frame.


OPTIONS
       The  programs  follow  the  usual  GNU  command  line syntax, with long
       options starting with two dashes (`-').

       -n, --no-wait
              returns immediately without waiting  for  you  to  "finish"  the
              buffer in Emacs.

       -e, --eval
              do  not  visit files but instead evaluate the arguments as Emacs
              Lisp expressions.

       -s, --socket-name=FILENAME
              use socket named FILENAME for communication.

       -f, --server-file=FILENAME
              use TCP configuration file FILENAME for communication.  This can
              also  be specified via the `EMACS_SERVER_FILE' environment vari-
              able.

       -a, --alternate-editor=EDITOR
              if the Emacs server is not running,  run  the  specified  editor
              instead.   This can also be specified via the `ALTERNATE_EDITOR'
              environment variable.

       -d, --display=DISPLAY
              tell the server to display the files on the given display.

       -V, --version
              print version information and exit

       -h, --help
              print this usage information message and exit
