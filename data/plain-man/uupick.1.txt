NAME
       uupick - retrieve files transferred by uuto

SYNOPSIS
       uupick [-s system] [--system system]

DESCRIPTION
       The  uupick  program is used to conveniently retrieve files transferred
       by the uuto program.

       For each file transferred by uuto, uupick will display the source  sys-
       tem,  the file name, and whether the name refers to a regular file or a
       directory.  It will then wait for the user  to  specify  an  action  to
       take.  One of the following commands must be entered:

       `q'
            Quit out of `uupick'.

       `RETURN'
            Skip the file.

       `m [directory]'
            Move the file or directory to the specified directory.  If no
            directory  is  specified,  the file is moved to the current direc-
       tory.

       `a [directory]'
            Move all files from this system to the specified directory.  If no
            directory is specified, the files are moved to the current
            directory.

       `p'
            List the file on standard output.

       `d'
            Delete the file.

       `! [command]'
            Execute `command' as a shell escape.

OPTIONS
       -s system, --system system
