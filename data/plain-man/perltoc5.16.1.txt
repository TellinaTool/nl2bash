           Sed Traps
           Shell Traps
           Perl Traps
           Perl4 to Perl5 Traps
               Discontinuance, Deprecation, and BugFix traps, Parsing Traps,
               Numerical Traps, General data type traps, Context Traps -
               scalar, list contexts, Precedence Traps, General Regular
               Expression Traps using s///, etc, Subroutine, Signal, Sorting
               Traps, OS Traps, DBM Traps, Unclassified Traps

           Discontinuance, Deprecation, and BugFix traps
               Symbols starting with "_" no longer forced into main, Double-
               colon valid package separator in variable name, 2nd and 3rd
               args to "splice()" are now in scalar context, Can't do "goto"
               into a block that is optimized away, Can't use whitespace as
               variable name or quote delimiter, "while/if BLOCK BLOCK" gone,
               "**" binds tighter than unary minus, "foreach" changed when
               iterating over a list, "split" with no args behavior changed,
               -e behavior fixed, "push" returns number of elements in
               resulting list, Some error messages differ, "split()" honors
               subroutine args, Bugs removed

           Parsing Traps
               Space between . and = triggers syntax error, Better parsing in
               perl 5, Function parsing, String interpolation of $#array
               differs, Perl guesses on "map", "grep" followed by "{" if it
               starts BLOCK or hash ref

           Numerical Traps
               Formatted output and significant digits, Auto-increment
               operator over signed int limit deleted, Assignment of return
               values from numeric equality tests doesn't work, Bitwise string
               ops

           General data type traps
               Negative array subscripts now count from the end of array,
               Setting $#array lower now discards array elements, Hashes get
               defined before use, Glob assignment from localized variable to
               variable, Assigning "undef" to glob, Changes in unary negation
               (of strings), Modifying of constants prohibited, "defined $var"
               behavior changed, Variable Suicide

           Context Traps - scalar, list contexts
               Elements of argument lists for formats evaluated in list
               context, "caller()" returns false value in scalar context if no
               caller present, Comma operator in scalar context gives scalar
               context to args, "sprintf()" prototyped as "($;@)"

           Precedence Traps
               LHS vs. RHS of any assignment operator, Semantic errors
               introduced due to precedence, Precedence of assignment
               operators same as the precedence of assignment, "open" requires
               parentheses around filehandle, $: precedence over $:: gone,
               Precedence of file test operators documented, "keys", "each",
               "values" are regular named unary operators

           General Regular Expression Traps using s///, etc.
               "s'$lhs'$rhs'" interpolates on either side, "m//g" attaches its
               state to the searched string, "m//o" used within an anonymous
               sub, $+ isn't set to whole match, Substitution now returns null
               string if it fails, "s`lhs`rhs`" is now a normal substitution,
               Stricter parsing of variables in regular expressions, "m?x?"
               matches only once, Failed matches don't reset the match
               variables

           Subroutine, Signal, Sorting Traps
               Barewords that used to look like strings look like subroutine
               calls, Reverse is no longer allowed as the name of a sort
               subroutine, "warn()" won't let you specify a filehandle

           OS Traps
               SysV resets signal handler correctly, SysV "seek()" appends
               correctly

           Interpolation Traps
               "@" always interpolates an array in double-quotish strings,
               Double-quoted strings may no longer end with an unescaped $,
               Arbitrary expressions are evaluated inside braces within double
               quotes, $$x now tries to dereference $x, Creation of hashes on
               the fly with "eval "EXPR"" requires protection, Bugs in earlier
               perl versions, Array and hash brackets during interpolation,
               Interpolation of "\$$foo{bar}", "qq()" string passed to "eval"
               will not find string terminator

           DBM Traps
               Perl5 must have been linked with same dbm/ndbm as the default
               for "dbmopen()", DBM exceeding limit on the key/value size will
               cause perl5 to exit immediately

           Unclassified Traps
               "require"/"do" trap using returned value, "split" on empty
               string with LIMIT specified

   perlunifaq - Perl Unicode FAQ
       Q and A
           perlunitut isn't really a Unicode tutorial, is it?
           What character encodings does Perl support?
           Which version of perl should I use?
           What about binary data, like images?
           When should I decode or encode?
           What if I don't decode?
           What if I don't encode?
           Is there a way to automatically decode or encode?
           What if I don't know which encoding was used?
           Can I use Unicode in my Perl sources?
           Data::Dumper doesn't restore the UTF8 flag; is it broken?
           Why do regex character classes sometimes match only in the ASCII
           range?
           Why do some characters not uppercase or lowercase correctly?
           How can I determine if a string is a text string or a binary
           string?
           How do I convert from encoding FOO to encoding BAR?
           What are "decode_utf8" and "encode_utf8"?
           What is a "wide character"?
       INTERNALS
           What is "the UTF8 flag"?
           What about the "use bytes" pragma?
           What about the "use encoding" pragma?
           What is the difference between ":encoding" and ":utf8"?
           What's the difference between "UTF-8" and "utf8"?
           I lost track; what encoding is the internal format really?

           Single form ("\p{name}") tighter rules:, white space adjacent to a
           non-word character, underscores separating digits in numbers,
           Compound form ("\p{name=value}" or "\p{name:value}") tighter
           rules:, Stabilized, Deprecated, Obsolete, * is a wild-card, (\d+)
           in the info column gives the number of code points matched by this
           property, D means this is deprecated, O means this is obsolete, S
           means this is stabilized, T means tighter (stricter) name matching
           applies, X means use of this form is discouraged, and may not be
           stable

           Legal "\p{}" and "\P{}" constructs that match no characters

           Using DB_File with Berkeley DB version 2 or greater
           Interface to Berkeley DB
           Opening a Berkeley DB Database File
           Default Parameters
           In Memory Databases
       DB_HASH
           A Simple Example
       DB_BTREE
           Changing the BTREE sort order
           Handling Duplicate Keys
           The get_dup() Method
           The find_dup() Method
           The del_dup() Method
           Matching Partial Keys
       DB_RECNO
           The 'bval' Option
           A Simple Example
           Extra RECNO Methods
               $X->push(list) ;, $value = $X->pop ;, $X->shift,
               $X->unshift(list) ;, $X->length, $X->splice(offset, length,
               elements);

           Another Example
       THE API INTERFACE
           $status = $X->get($key, $value [, $flags]) ;, $status =
           $X->put($key, $value [, $flags]) ;, $status = $X->del($key [,
           $flags]) ;, $status = $X->fd ;, $status = $X->seq($key, $value,

   ExtUtils::MakeMaker::FAQ - Frequently Asked Questions About MakeMaker
       DESCRIPTION
           Module Installation
               How do I install a module into my home directory?, How do I get
               MakeMaker and Module::Build to install to the same place?, How
               do I keep from installing man pages?, How do I use a module
               without installing it?, PREFIX vs INSTALL_BASE from
               Module::Build::Cookbook

           Philosophy and History
               Why not just use <insert other build config tool here>?, What
               is Module::Build and how does it relate to MakeMaker?, pure
               perl.   no make, no shell commands, easier to customize,
               cleaner internals, less cruft

           Module Writing
               How do I keep my $VERSION up to date without resetting it
               manually?, What's this META.yml thing and how did it get in my
               MANIFEST?!, How do I delete everything not in my MANIFEST?,
               Which tar should I use on Windows?, Which zip should I use on
               Windows for '[nd]make zipdist'?

           XS  How to I prevent "object version X.XX does not match bootstrap
               parameter Y.YY" errors?, How do I make two or more XS files
               coexist in the same directory?

       FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS
           So how do I use a proxy with File::Fetch?
           I used 'lynx' to fetch a file, but its contents is all wrong!
           Files I'm trying to fetch have reserved characters or non-ASCII
           characters in them. What do I do?

   Module::Build::Cookbook - Examples of Module::Build Usage
       DESCRIPTION
       BASIC RECIPES
           Installing modules that use Module::Build
           Modifying Config.pm values
           Installing modules using the programmatic interface
           Installing to a temporary directory
           Installing to a non-standard directory
           Installing in the same location as ExtUtils::MakeMaker
           Running a single test file
       ADVANCED RECIPES
           Making a CPAN.pm-compatible distribution
           Changing the order of the build process
           Adding new file types to the build process
           Adding new elements to the install process
       EXAMPLES ON CPAN
           SVN-Notify-Mirror
               1. Using "auto_features", I check to see whether two optional
               modules are available - SVN::Notify::Config and Net::SSH;, 2.
               If the S::N::Config module is loaded, I automatically generate
               test files for it during Build (using the "PL_files" property),
               3. If the "ssh_feature" is available, I ask if the user wishes
               to perform the ssh tests (since it requires a little
               preliminary setup);, 4. Only if the user has "ssh_feature" and
               answers yes to the testing, do I generate a test file

       Obtaining and installing libnet
           What is libnet ?
           Which version of perl do I need ?
           What other modules do I need ?
           What machines support libnet ?
           Where can I get the latest libnet release
       Using Net::FTP
           How do I download files from an FTP server ?
           How do I transfer files in binary mode ?
           How can I get the size of a file on a remote FTP server ?
           How can I get the modification time of a file on a remote FTP
           server ?
           How can I change the permissions of a file on a remote server ?
           Can I do a reget operation like the ftp command ?
           How do I get a directory listing from an FTP server ?
           Changing directory to "" does not fail ?
           I am behind a SOCKS firewall, but the Firewall option does not work
           ?
           I am behind an FTP proxy firewall, but cannot access machines
           outside ?
           My ftp proxy firewall does not listen on port 21
           Is it possible to change the file permissions of a file on an FTP
           server ?
           I have seen scripts call a method message, but cannot find it
           documented ?
           Why does Net::FTP not implement mput and mget methods
       Using Net::SMTP
           Why can't the part of an Email address after the @ be used as the
           hostname ?
           Why does Net::SMTP not do DNS MX lookups ?
           The verify method always returns true ?
       Debugging scripts
           How can I debug my scripts that use Net::* modules ?

       SYNOPSIS
       DESCRIPTION
           Call Pod::Perldoc::GetOptsOO::getopts($object, \@ARGV, $truth),
           Given -n, if there's a opt_n_with, it'll call $object->opt_n_with(
           ARGUMENT ) (e.g., "-n foo" => $object->opt_n_with('foo').    Ditto
           "-nfoo"), Otherwise (given -n) if there's an opt_n, we'll call it
           $object->opt_n($truth) (Truth defaults to 1), Otherwise we try
           calling $object->handle_unknown_option('n')    (and we increment
           the error count by the return value of it), If there's no
           handle_unknown_option, then we just warn, and then increment    the
           error counter
