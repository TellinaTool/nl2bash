NAME
       seeksize.d - print disk event seek report. Uses DTrace.

SYNOPSIS
       seeksize.d

DESCRIPTION
       seeksize.d  is  a simple DTrace program to print a report of disk event
       seeks by process.

       This can be used to identify whether processes are accessing the  disks
       in  a  "random"  or "sequential" manner. Sequential is often desirable,
       indicated by mostly zero length seeks.

       Since this uses DTrace, only users with root privileges  can  run  this
       command.

EXAMPLES
       Sample until Ctrl-C is hit then print report,
              # seeksize.d


FIELDS
       PID    process ID

       CMD    command and argument list

       value  distance in disk blocks (sectors)

       count  number of I/O operations


DOCUMENTATION
       See  the  DTraceToolkit for further documentation under the Docs direc-
       tory. The DTraceToolkit docs may include full worked examples with ver-
       bose descriptions explaining the output.

EXIT
       seeksize.d will sample until Ctrl-C is hit.
