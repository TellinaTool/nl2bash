NAME
       uuname - list remote UUCP sites

SYNOPSIS
       uuname [-a] [--aliases]

       uuname [-l] [--local]

DESCRIPTION
       By default, the uuname program simply lists the names of all the remote
       systems mentioned in the UUCP configuration files.

       The uuname program may also be used to print the UUCP name of the local
       system.

       The uuname program is mainly for use by shell scripts.

OPTIONS
       -a, --aliases
            List  all  aliases  for remote systems, as well as their canonical
            names.  Aliases may be specified in the `sys' file.

       -l, --local
            Print the UUCP name of the local system, rather than  listing  the
            names of all the remote systems.

       Standard UUCP options:

       -x type, --debug type
            Turn  on particular debugging types.  The following types are rec-
            ognized: abnormal, chat, handshake, uucp-proto, proto, port,  con-
            fig, spooldir, execute, incoming, outgoing.

       -I file, --config file
            Set configuration file to use.

       -v, --version
