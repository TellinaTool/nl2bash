NAME
       javadoc - Java API documentation generator

SYNOPSIS
       javadoc [ options ] [ packagenames ] [ sourcefilenames ] [ -subpackages
       pkg1:pkg2:...  ] [ @argfiles ]

PARAMETERS
       Arguments can be in any order.

       options        Command-line options, as specified in this document.  To
                      see  a  typical  use  of javadoc options, see Real World
                      Example.

       packagenames   A series of names of packages, separated by spaces, such
                      as java.lang java.lang.reflect java.awt.  You must sepa-
                      rately specify each package you want to  document.   The
                      Javadoc  tool uses -sourcepath to look for these package
                      names.  The Javadoc tool does not  recursively  traverse
                      subpackages.   Wildcards  such  as asterisks (*) are not
                      allowed.  See EXAMPLES, Documenting One  or  More  Pack-
                      ages.

       sourcefilenames
                      A series of source file names, separated by spaces, each
                      of which can include paths and wildcards such as  aster-
                      isk (*).  The Javadoc tool will process every file whose
                      name ends with .java , and whose name, when stripped  of
                      that suffix, is actually a legal class name (see Identi-
                      fiers).  Therefore, you can name files with dashes (such
                      as  X-Buffer),  or  other illegal characters, to prevent
                      them from being documented.  This  is  useful  for  test
                      files and files generated from templates.  The path that
                      precedes the source file name determines  where  javadoc
                      will  look  for the file.  The Javadoc tool does not use
                      -sourcepath to look for these source file  names.)   For
                      example,  passing  in Button.java is identical to ./But-
                      ton.java.  An example source file name with a full  path
                      is   /home/src/java/awt/Graphics*.java.   See  EXAMPLES,
                      Documenting One or More Classes.  You can also mix pack-
                      agenames  and sourcefilenames, as in EXAMPLES, Document-
                      ing Both Packages and Classes.

       -subpackages pkg1:pkg2:...
                      Generates documentation from source files in the  speci-
                      fied  packages  and recursively in their subpackages. An
                      alternative to  supplying  packagenames  or  sourcefile-
                      names.

       @argfiles      One  or  more  files  that  contain  a  list  of Javadoc
                      options, packagenames and sourcefilenames in any  order.
                      Wildcards  (*)  and  -J options are not allowed in these
                      files.

DESCRIPTION
       The Javadoc tool parses the declarations and documentation comments  in
       a  set  of  Java  source files and produces a corresponding set of HTML
       pages describing (by default) the public and protected classes,  nested
       classes  (but  not  anonymous inner classes), interfaces, constructors,
       methods, and fields.

       You can run the Javadoc tool  on  entire  packages,  individual  source
       files,  or  both.   In  the  first  case, you pass in as an argument to
       javadoc a series of package names.  In the second case, you pass  in  a
       series  of  source (.java) file names.  See EXAMPLES at the end of this
       document.

              NOTE - When you pass in package names to the  Javadoc  tool,  it
              currently  processes  all .java classes in the specified package
              directories, even if the .java files are code examples or  other
              classes that are not actually members of the specified packages.
              It does not parse each .java file for a package declaration;  we
              may add this parsing in a future release.

       During a run, the Javadoc tool automatically adds cross-reference links
       to package, class and member names that are being documented as part of
       that run. Links appear in several places:

       o Declarations (return types, argument types, field types)

       o "See Also" sections generated from @see tags

       o In-line text generated from {@link} tags

       o Exception names generated from @throws tags

       o Specified  by  links  to members in interfaces and Overrides links to
         members in classes

       o Summary tables listing packages, classes and members

       o Package and class inheritance trees

       o The index

       You can add hyperlinks to existing text for classes not included on the
       command  line  (but  generated  separately)  by  way  of  the -link and
       -linkoffline options.

       The Javadoc tool produces one complete document each time it is run; it
       cannot  do  incremental  builds - that is, it cannot modify or directly
       incorporate results from previous runs of Javadoc. However, it can link
       to results from other runs, as just mentioned.

       As  implemented,  the Javadoc tool requires and relies on the java com-
       piler to do its job. The Javadoc tool calls part of  javac  to  compile
       the declarations, ignoring the member implementation.  It builds a rich
       internal representation of the classes, including the class  hierarchy,
       and "use" relationships, then generates the HTML from that. The Javadoc
       tool also picks up user-supplied documentation from documentation  com-
       ments in the source code.

       In  fact, the Javadoc tool will run on .java source files that are pure
       stub files with no method bodies.  This means you can write  documenta-
       tion comments and run the Javadoc tool in the earliest stages of design
       while creating the API, before writing the implementation.

       Relying on the  compiler  ensures  that  the  HTML  output  corresponds
       exactly  with  the  actual  implementation, which may rely on implicit,
       rather than explicit, source code.  For example, the Javadoc tool  will
       document  default constructors (section 8.6.7 of Java Language Specifi-
       cation) that are present in the .class files  but  not  in  the  source
       code.

       In  many  cases,  the Javadoc tool allows you to generate documentation
       from source files whose code is incomplete or erroneous. This is a ben-
       efit  that  enables  you to generate documentation before all debugging
       and troubleshooting is done. For example, according to  the  Java  Lan-
       guage  Specification,  a  class that contains an abstract method should
       itself be declared abstract. The Javadoc tool does not check for  this,
       and  would  proceed without a warning, whereas the javac compiler stops
       on this error. The Javadoc tool does do some primitive checking of  doc
       comments.  Use the DocCheck doclet to check the doc comments more thor-
       oughly.

       When the Javadoc tool builds its internal structure for the  documenta-
       tion,  it  loads  all referenced classes.  Because of this, the Javadoc
       tool must be able to find all  referenced  classes,  whether  bootstrap
       classes,  extensions,  or  user  classes.  For more about this, see How
       Classes Are Found.  Generally speaking, classes you create must  either
       be loaded as an extension or in the Javadoc tool's class path.

   javadoc Doclets
       You  can  customize the content and format of the Javadoc tool's output
       by using doclets. The Javadoc tool has  a  default  "built-in"  doclet,
       called  the standard doclet, that generates HTML-formatted API documen-
       tation.  You can modify or subclass the standard doclet, or write  your
       own  doclet  to  generate HTML, XML, MIF, RTF or whatever output format
       you'd like.  Information about doclets and their use is at the  follow-
       ing locations:


       o Javadoc Doclets

       o The -doclet command-line option

       When  a  custom  doclet  is not specified with the -doclet command line
       option, the Javadoc tool uses the default standard doclet.  The Javadoc
       tool  has several command line options that are available regardless of
       which doclet is being used.  The standard doclet adds  a  supplementary
       set  of command line options.  Both sets of options are described below
       in the options section.

   Terminology
       A few terms have specific meanings within the context  of  the  Javadoc
       tool:

       generated document
                      The  document generated by the javadoc tool from the doc
                      comments in Java source  code.   The  default  generated
                      document  is  in  HTML  and  is  created by the standard
                      doclet.

       name           A name in the Java Language, namely the name of a  pack-
                      age, class, interface, field, constructor, or method.  A
                      name     can     be     fully-qualified,     such     as
                      java.lang.String.equals(java.lang.Object), or partially-
                      qualified, such as equals(Object).

       documented classes
                      The classes and interfaces for which full  documentation
                      is generated during a javadoc run. To be documented, the
                      source files must be available, and either their  source
                      filenames  or  package  names  must  be  passed into the
                      javadoc command.  We also refer to these as the  classes
                      included in the javadoc run, or the included classes.

       inlcuded classes
                      Classes and interfaces whose source filenames or package
                      names are passed into the javadoc command.

       excluded classes
                      Classes and interfaces whose source filename or  package
                      names are not passed into the javadoc command.

       referenced classes
                      The  classes and interfaces that are explicitly referred
                      to in the definition (implementation) or doc comments of
                      the documented classes and interfaces.  Examples of ref-
                      erences include return type, parameter type, cast  type,
                      extended class, implemented interface, imported classes,
                      classes  used   in   method   bodies,   @see,   {@link},
                      {@linkplain}, and {@inheritDoc} tags.  (Notice this def-
                      inition has changed since 1.3.)  tags) do not qualify as
                      referenced  classes.   When  thE Javadoc tool is run, it
                      should load into memory all of the referenced classes in
                      javadoc's  bootclasspath  and  classpath.   (The Javadoc
                      tool prints a "Class not found" warning  for  referenced
                      classes  not found.)  The Javadoc tool can derive enough
                      information from the .class  files  to  determine  their
                      existence  and  the  fully qualified names of their mem-
                      bers.

       external referenced classes
                      The referenced classes  whose  documentation  not  being
                      generated  during  a javadoc run.  In other words, these
                      classes are not passed into  the  Javadoc  tool  on  the
                      comand  line.  Links for names in the generated documen-
                      tation to those classes are said to be  external  refer-
                      ences  or  external  links.  For example, if you run the
                      Javadoc tool on only  the  java.awt  package,  then  any
                      class  in java.lang, such as Object, is an external ref-
                      erenced  class.   External  referenced  classes  can  be
                      linked  to using the -link and -linkoffline options.  An
                      important property of an external  referenced  class  is
                      that  its  source comments are normally not available to
                      the Javadoc run. In this case, these comments cannot  be
                      inherited.

   Source Files
       The  Javadoc  tool will generate output originating from four different
       types of  "source"  files:  Java  language  source  files  for  classes
       (.java),  package  comment files, overview comment files, and miscella-
       neous unprocessed files.

   Class Source Code Files
       Each class or interface and its members can have their  own  documenta-
       tion  comment, contained in a .java file.  For more details about these
       doc commments, see Documentation Comments below.

   Package Comment Files
       Each package can have its own documentation comment, contained  in  its
       own  "source"  file,  that the Javadoc tool will merge into the package
       summary page that it generates.  You typically include in this  comment
       any documentation that applies to the entire package.

       To  create  a  package  comment file, you must name it package.html and
       place it in the package directory in the source  tree  along  with  the
       .java files. The Javadoc tool will automatically look for this filename
       in this location.  Notice that the filename is identical for all  pack-
       ages. For explicit details, see the example of package.html.

       The  content  of the package comment file is one big documentation com-
       ment, written in HTML, like all other comments, with one exception: The
       documentation comment should not include the comment separators /** and
       */ or leading asterisks.  When writing the comment, you should make the
       first  sentence a summary about the package, and not put a title or any
       other text between <body> and the  first  sentence.   You  can  include
       package  tags;  as  with  any  documentation  comment,  all tags except
       {@link} must appear after the description.  If you add a @see tag in  a
       package comment file, it must have a fully qualified name.

       When  the  Javadoc  tool runs, it automatically looks for this file; if
       found, the Javadoc tool does the following:


       o Copies all content between <body> and </body> tags for processing.

       o Processes any package tags that are present.

       o Inserts the processed text at the bottom of the package summary  page
         it generates, as shown in Package Summary.

       o Copies  the  first  sentence of the package comment to the top of the
         package summary page.  It also adds the package name and  this  first
         sentence  to  the  list of packages on the overview page, as shown in
         Overview Summary.  The end-of-sentence  is  determined  by  the  same
         rules  used  for  the  end  of the first sentence of class and member
         descriptions.

   Overview Comment File
       Each application or set of packages that you are documenting  can  have
       its  own overview documentation comment, kept in its own "source" file,
       that the Javadoc tool will merge into the overview page that it  gener-
       ates.   You  typically  include  in this comment any documentation that
       applies to the entire application or set of packages.

       To create an overview comment file, you can name the file anything  you
       want,  typically overview.html, and place it anywhere, typically at the
       top level of the source tree.  Notice that you can have multiple  over-
       view  comment  files for the same set of source files, in case you want
       to run javadoc multiple times on different sets of packages.  For exam-
       ple,  if  the source files for the java.applet package are contained in
       /home/user/src/java/applet directory, you could create an overview com-
       ment file at /home/user/src/overview.html.

       The  content of the overview comment file is one big documentation com-
       ment, written in HTML, like the package comment file  described  previ-
       ously.   See  that description for details.  To reiterate, when writing
       the comment, you should make the first sentence  a  summary  about  the
       application  or  set of packages, and not put a title or any other text
       between <body> and the first sentence.  You can include overview  tags;
       as  with any documentation comment, all tags except {@link} must appear
       after the description.  If you add a @see tag, it must  have  a  fully-
       qualified name.

       When  you  run  the Javadoc tool, you specify the overview comment file
       name with the -overview option.  The file is then processed, similar to
       that of a package comment file:

       o Copies all content between <body> and </body> tags for processing.

       o Processes any overview tags that are present.

       o Inserts the processed text at the bottom of the overview page it gen-
         erates, as shown in Overview Summary.

       o Copies the first sentence of the overview comment to the top  of  the
         overview summary page.

   Miscellaneous Unprocessed Files
       You  can  also  include in your source any miscellaneous files that you
       want the Javadoc tool to copy to the destination directory.  These typ-
       ically  include  graphic  files  (for  example, Java source (.java) and
       class (.class) files) and self-standing HTML files whose content  would
       overwhelm the documentation comment of a normal Java source file.

       To include unprocessed files, put them in a directory called doc-files,
       which can be a subdirectory of any package directory.  You can have one
       such  subdirectory for each package.  You might include images, example
       code, source files, .class files, applets, and HTML files.   For  exam-
       ple,  if  you  want  to include the image of a button button.gif in the
       java.awt.Button  class  documentation,  you  place  that  file  in  the
       /home/user/src/java/awt/doc-files/  directory.   Notice  the  doc-files
       directory  should  not  be  located  at   /home/user/src/java/doc-files
       because  java  is not a package - that is, it does not directly contain
       any source files.

       All links to these unprocessed files must be  hard-coded,  because  the
       Javadoc  tool  does not look at the files - it simply copies the direc-
       tory and all its contents to the destination.  For example, the link in
       the Button.java doc comment might look like:

       /**
       * This button looks like this:
       * <img src="doc-files/Button.gif">
       */

Test Files and Template Files
       Some  developers  have indicated they want to store test files and tem-
       plates files in the source tree near their corresponding source  files.
       That is, they would like to put them in the same directory, or a subdi-
       rectory, of those source files.

       If you run the Javadoc tool by explicitly passing in individual source-
       filenames,  you  can deliberately omit test and templates files andpre-
       vent them from being processed. However, if you are passing in  package
       names  or  wildcards,  you  need to follow certain rulesto ensure these
       test files and templates files are not processed.

       Test files differ from template files in that the former arelegal, com-
       pilable  source  files,  while  the  latter  are  not, but may end with
       ".java".

       Test files -
              Often developers want to put compilable, runnable test files for
              a  given  package  in the same directory as the source files for
              that package.  But they want the test files to belong to a pack-
              age  other  than  the  source  file package, such as the unnamed
              package (so test files have no package statement or a  different
              package  statement  from the source). In this scenario, when the
              source is being documented by specifying its package name speci-
              fied  on the command line, the test files will cause warnings or
              errors. You need to put such test files in a  subdirectory.  For
              example,  if  you  want  to  add  test files for source files in
              com.package1 put them in a subdirectory that would be an invalid
              package name (because it contains a hyphen):

            com/package1/test-files/

       The  test  directory  will be skipped by the Javadoc tool with no warn-
       ings.

       If your test files contain doc comments, you can set up a separate  run
       of the Javadoc tool to produce documentation of the test files by pass-
       ing in their test source filenames with wildcards,  such  as  com/pack-
       age/   est-filesjava .

       Tempaltes for source files -
              Template  files have names that often end in ".java" and are not
              compilable. If you have a template for a source  file  that  you
              want  to  keep  in  the source directory, you can name it with a
              dash (such as Buffer-Template.java ), or any other illegal  Java
              character,  to  prevent  it from being processed. This relies on
              the fact that the Javadoc tool  will  only  process  sourcefiles
              whose  name,  when stripped of the ".java" suffix, is actually a
              legal class name (see Identifiers ).

   Generated Files
       By default, javadoc uses a standard doclet that generates  HTML-format-
       ted  documentation.  This doclet generates the following kinds of files
       (where each HTML "page" corresponds to a  separate  file).   Note  that
       javadoc  generates  files  with  two  types of names: those named after
       classes/interfaces, and  those  that  are  not  (such  as  package-sum-
       mary.html).   Files in the latter group contain hyphens to prevent file
       name conflicts with those in the former group.

   Basic Content Pages
       o One class or interface page (classname.html) for each class or inter-
         face it is documenting.

       o One  package page (package-summary.html) for each package it is docu-
         menting. The Javadoc tool includes any HTML text provided in  a  file
         named package.html in the package directory of the source tree.

       o One overview page (overview-summary.html) for the entire set of pack-
         ages.  This is the front page of the generated document.  The Javadoc
         tool  includes  any  HTML  text provided in a file specified with the
         -overview option.  Note that this file is created only  if  you  pass
         into javadoc two or more package names.  For further explanation, see
         HTML Frames below.

   Cross-Reference Pages
       o One class hierarchy page for the entire set  of  packages  (overview-
         tree.html).  To view this, click on "Overview" in the navigation bar,
         then click on "Tree".

       o One class hierarchy page for each  package  (package-tree.html).   To
         view this, go to a particular package, class or interface page; click
         "Tree" to display the hierarchy for that package.

       o One "use" page for each package (package-use.html) and a separate one
         for  each  class  and interface (class-use/classname.html). This page
         describes what packages, classes, methods, constructors,  and  fields
         use  any  part  of  the  given class, interface, or package.  Given a
         class or interface A, its "use" page includes subclasses of A, fields
         declared  as  A,  methods that return A, and methods and constructors
         with parameters of type A.  You can access this page by  first  going
         to  the package, class, or interface, then clicking on the "Use" link
         in the navigation bar.

       o A deprecated API page (deprecated-list.html) listing  all  deprecated
         names.   (A deprecated name is not recommended for use, generally due
         to improvements, and a replacement name is usually given.  Deprecated
         APIs may be removed in future implementations.)

       o A constant field values page (constant-values.html) for the values of
         static fields.

       o A serialized form page (serialized-form.html) for  information  about
         serializable  and  externalizable  classes.   Each  such  class has a
         description of its serialization fields and methods.   This  informa-
         tion  is  of interest to re-implementors, not to developers using the
         API.  While there is no link in the navigation bar, you  can  get  to
         this information by going to any serialized class and clicking "Seri-
         alized Form" in the "See also" section of the class description.  The
         standard  doclet  automatically generates a serialized form page: any
         class  (public  or  non-public)  that  implements   Serializable   is
         included,  along  with readObject and writeObject methods, the fields
         that are serialized, and the doc comments from the @serial,  @serial-
         Field,  and  @serialData  tags.  Public  serializable  classes can be
         excluded by marking them (or their package) with @serial exclude, and
         package-private  serializable classes can be included by marking them
         (or their package) with @serial include. As of 1.4, you can  generate
         the  complete  serialized form for public and private classes by run-
         ning javadoc without specifying the -private option.

       o An index (index-*.html) of all class, interface,  constructor,  field
         and method names, alphabetically arranged.  This is internationalized
         for Unicode and can be generated as a single file or  as  a  separate
         file for each starting character (such as A-Z for English).

   Support Files
       o A help page (help-doc.html) that describes the navigation bar and the
         above pages.  You can provide your own custom help file  to  override
         the default using -helpfile.

       o One  index.html  file that creates the HTML frames for display.  This
         is the file you load to display the front  page  with  frames.   This
         file itself contains no text content.

       o Several  frame  files  (*-frame.html)  containing  lists of packages,
         classes and interfaces, used when HTML frames are being displayed.

       o A package list file (package-list), used by the  -link  and  -linkof-
         fline  options.   This is a text file, not HTML, and is not reachable
         through any links.

       o A style sheet file (stylesheet.css) that controls a limited amount of
         color,  font  family,  font  size, font style, and positioning on the
         generated pages.

       o A doc-files directory that holds any image, example, source code,  or
         other files that you want copied to the destination directory.  These
         files are not processed by the Javadoc tool in any manner,  that  is,
         any javadoc tags in them will be ignored.  This directory is not gen-
         erated unless it exists in the source tree.

   HTML Frames
       The Javadoc tool will generate either two  or  three  HTML  frames,  as
       shown  in  the  figure below.  When you pass source files (*.java) or a
       single package name as arguments into the javadoc command,  it  creates
       only  one  frame  (C)  in  the  left-hand  column, that is, the list of
       classes.  When you pass into javadoc two or more package names, it cre-
       ates  a  third  frame  (P) listing all packages, as well as an overview
       page (Detail).  This overview page has  the  file  name,  overview-sum-
       mary.html.   Thus, this file is created only if you pass in two or more
       package names.  You can bypass frames by clicking on  the  "No  Frames"
       link or entering at overview-summary.html.

       If you are unfamiliar with HTML frames, you should be aware that frames
       can have focus for printing and scrolling.   To  give  a  frame  focus,
       click  on it.  Then, on many browsers the arrow keys and page keys will
       scroll that frame, and the print menu command will print it.

           ------------                  ------------
           |C| Detail |                  |P| Detail |
           | |        |                  | |        |
           | |        |                  |-|        |
           | |        |                  |C|        |
           | |        |                  | |        |
           | |        |                  | |        |
           ------------                  ------------
          javadoc *.java           javadoc java.lang java.awt

       Load one of the following two files as the starting page  depending  on
       whether you want HTML frames or not:


       o index.html (for frames)

       o overview-summary.html (for no frames)

   Generated File Structure
       The  generated  class  and  interface  files  are organized in the same
       directory hierarchy as Java source files and class files.  This  struc-
       ture is one directory per subpackage.

       For  example,  the  document generated for the class java.applet.Applet
       would be located at java/applet/Applet.html.  The  file  structure  for
       the  java.applet  package follows, given that the destination directory
       is named apidocs.  All files that contain the word  "frame"  appear  in
       the  upper-left  or  lower-left frames, as noted.  All other HTML files
       appear in the right-hand frame.

       NOTE: Directories are shown in bold.  The asterisks  (*)  indicate  the
       files  and  directories  that are omitted when the arguments to javadoc
       are source file names (*.java) rather than package names.   Also,  when
       arguments  are source file names, package-list is created but is empty.
       The doc-files directory is not created in  the  destination  unless  it
       exists in the source tree.

   Generated API Declarations
       The  Javadoc  tool  generates a declaration at the start of each class,
       interface, field, constructor, and method description. This declaration
       is  the declaration for that API item. For example, the declaration for
       the Boolean class is:

              public final class Boolean
              extends Object
              implements Serializable

       and the declaration for the Boolean.valueOf method is:

              public static Boolean valueOf(String s)

       The Javadoc tool can include the modifiers public, protected,  private,
       abstract,  final, static, transient, and volatile, but not synchronized
       or native.  These last  two  modifiers  are  considered  implementation
       detail and not part of the API specification.

       Rather  than  relying on the keyword synchronized, APIs should document
       their concurrency semantics in the comment description, as in "a single
       Enumeration cannot be used by multiple threads concurrently".  The doc-
       ument should not describe how to achieve these  semantics.  As  another
       example,  while  Hashtable  should be thread-safe, there's no reason to
       specify that we achieve this by synchronizing all of its exported meth-
       ods.  We  should  reserve  the  right  to synchronize internally at the
       bucket level, thus offering higher concurrency.


   Documentation Comments
       The original "Documentation Comments Specification" can be found  under
       related documentation.

   Commenting the Source Code
       You  can  include documentation comments ("doc comments") in the source
       code, ahead of declarations for any entity (classes, interfaces,  meth-
       ods,  constructors,  or  fields).  You can also create doc comments for
       each package and another one for the overview, though their  syntax  is
       slightly  different.   Doc comments are also known as Javadoc comments.
       A doc comment consists of the characters  between  the  characters  /**
       that  begin  the  comment  and  the characters */ that end it.  Leading
       asterisks are allowed on each line and  are  described  further  below.
       The text can continue onto multiple lines.

              /**
              * This is the typical format of a simple documentation comment
              * that spans two lines.
              */

       To save space you can put a comment on one line:

              /** This comment takes up only one line. */

       Placement of comments - Documentation comments are recognized only when
       placed immediately before class,  interface,  constructor,  method,  or
       field  declarations  (see  the class example, method example, and field
       example).  Documentation comments placed in the body of  a  method  are
       ignored.   Only  one documentation comment per declaration statement is
       recognized by the Javadoc tool.

       A common mistake is to put an import statement between the  class  com-
       ment and the class declaration.  Avoid this, as javadoc will ignore the
       class comment.

              /**
              * This is the class comment for the class Whatever.
              */

              import com.sun;   // MISTAKE - Important not to put statement here

              public class Whatever {
              }

       A comment is a description followed by tags -  The  description  begins
       after  the  starting delimiter /** and continues until the tag section.
       The tag section starts with the first character @ that  begins  a  line
       (ignoring leading asterisks and white space).  It is possible to have a
       comment with only tags and no description.  The description cannot con-
       tinue  after  the  tag  section begins.  The argument to a tag can span
       multiple lines.  There can be any number of tags - some types  of  tags
       can be repeated while others cannot.  This @see starts the tag section:

               /**
               * This is a doc comment.
               * @see java.lang.Object
               */

       Standard and in-line tags - A tag is a special  keyword  within  a  doc
       comment that the Javadoc tool can process.  The Javadoc tool has stand-
       alone tags, which appear as @tag, and in-line tags, which appear within
       braces,  as {@tag}.  To be interpreted, a standalone tag must appear at
       the beginning of a line, ignoring leading asterisks,  white  space  and
       comment  separator (/**).  This means you can use the @ character else-
       where in the text and it will not be interpreted as the start of a tag.
       If  you  want  to  start a line with the @ character and not have it be
       interpreted, use the HTML entity &#064;.  Each standalone tag has asso-
       ciated  text,  which includes any text following the tag up to, but not
       including, either the next tag, or the end of  the  doc  comment.  This
       associated text can span multiple lines.  An in-line tag is allowed and
       interpreted anywhere that text is allowed. The following  example  con-
       tains the standalone tag @deprecated and in-line tag {@link}.

              /**
               * @deprecated As of JDk 1.1, replaced by {@link #setBounds(int,int,int,int)}
               */

       Comments  are  written  in  HTML - The text must be written in HTML, in
       that they should use HTML entities and HTML tags.  You can  use  which-
       ever  version  of HTML your browser supports; we have written the stan-
       dard doclet to generate HTML 3.2-compliant code elsewhere  (outside  of
       the  documentation  comments)  with  the  inclusion  of cascading style
       sheets and frames.  (We preface each generated  file  with  "HTML  4.0"
       because of the frame sets.)

       For  example,  entities for the less-than (<) and greater-than (>) sym-
       bols should be written &lt; and  &gt;.   Likewise,  the  ampersand  (&)
       should be written &amp;.  The bold HTML tag <b> is shown in the follow-
       ing example:

              /**
              * This is a <b>doc</b> comment.
              * @see java.lang.Object
              */

       Leading asterisks - When javadoc parses a doc comment, leading asterisk
       (*)  characters  on  each line are discarded; blanks and tabs preceding
       the initial asterisk (*) characters are also discarded.   If  you  omit
       the  leading  asterisk  on  a line, all leading white space is removed.
       Therefore, you should not omit leading asterisks if  you  want  leading
       white  space  to  be  kept, such as when indenting sample code with the
       <pre> tag.

       First sentence - The first sentence of each doc  comment  should  be  a
       summary  sentence, containing a concise but complete description of the
       declared entity.  This sentence ends at the first period that  is  fol-
       lowed  by  a blank, tab, or line terminator, or at the first standalone
       tag. The Javadoc tool copies this first sentence to the member  summary
       at the top of the HTML page.

       Declaration  with  multiple  fields  -  Java  allows declaring multiple
       fields in a single statement, but this statement can have only one doc-
       umentation  comment, which is copied for all fields.  Therefore, if you
       want individual documentation comments for each field, you must declare
       each  field  in a separate statement.  For example, the following docu-
       mentation comment doesn't make sense when written as a single  declara-
       tion and would be better handled as two declarations:

              /**
              * The horizontal and vertical distances of point (x,y)
              */
              public int x, y;      // Avoid this

       The  Javadoc  tool generates the following documentation from the above
       code:

              public int x
              The horizontal and vertical distances of point (x,y).
              public int y
              The horizontal and vertical distances of point (x,y).

       Use header tags carefully - When  writing  documentation  comments  for
       members, it is best not to use HTML heading tags such as <H1> and <H2>,
       because the Javadoc tool creates  an  entire  structured  document  and
       these  structural  tags can interfere with the formatting of the gener-
       ated document.  However, it is fine to use these headings in class  and
       package comments to provide your own structure.


   Automatic Reuse of Method Comments
       The  Javadoc  tool  has the ability to automatically reuse or "inherit"
       method comments in classes  and  interfaces.  When  a  description,  or
       @return,  @param, @see or @throws tag is missing from a method comment,
       the Javadoc tool instead copies the corresponding  description  or  tag
       comment  from the method it overrides or implements (if any), according
       to the algorithm below.

       More specifically, when a @param tag  for  a  particular  parameter  is
       missing,  then  the  comment  for  that  parameter  is copied.  When an
       @throws tag for a particular exception is missing, the @throws  tag  is
       copied only if that exception is declared.

       This  behavior  contrasts with version 1.3 and earlier, where the pres-
       ence of any description or tag would prevent all  comments  from  being
       inherited.

       Also  of  interest,  is  the  inline  tag {@inheritDoc} is present in a
       description or any tag, the corresponding description or tag is  copied
       at that spot.

       The  overridden  method must be a member of a documented class, and not
       an external referenced class for the doc comment to actually be  avail-
       able to copy.

       Inheriting of comments occurs in three cases:

       o When a method in a class overrides a method in a superclass
       o When a method in an interface overrides a method in a superinterface
       o When a method in a class implements a method in an interface

       In  the  first two cases, for method overrides, the Javadoc tool gener-
       ates a subheading "Overrides" in the documentation for  the  overriding
       method, with a link to the method it is overriding.

       In  the  third case, when a method in a given class implements a method
       in an interface, the Javadoc tool generates a subheading "Specified by"
       in  the  documentation  for  the  overriding method, with a link to the
       method it is implementing.

       Algorithm for Inheriting Method Descriptions If a method does not  have
       a  doc  comment,  the  Javadoc  tool searches for an applicable comment
       using the following algorithm, which is designed to find the most  spe-
       cific  applicable  doc  comment,  giving  preference to interfaces over
       superclasses:

       1.  Look in each directly implemented (or extended)  interface  in  the
           order they appear following the word implements (or extends) in the
           method declaration. Use  the  first  doc  comment  found  for  this
           method.

       2.  If  step  1  failed  to  find a doc comment, recursively apply this
           entire algorithm to each directly implemented (or extended)  inter-
           face, in the same order they were examined in step 1.

       3. If step 2 failed to find a doc comment and this is
           a class other than Object (not an interface):

           a. If the superclass has a doc comment for this method, use it.
           b. If step 3a failed to find a doc comment, recursively apply this
           entire algorithm to the superclass.


   javadoc Tags
       The  Javadoc  tool  parses special tags when they are embedded within a
       Java doc comment.  These doc tags enable you  to  autogenerate  a  com-
       plete,  well-formatted  API from your source code.  The tags start with
       an "at" sign (@) and are case-sensitive - they must be typed  with  the
       uppercase  and  lowercase  letters  as  shown.  A tag must start at the
       beginning of a line (after any leading spaces and an optional asterisk)
       or  it  is  treated  as normal text.  By convention, tags with the same
       name are grouped together.  For example, put all @see tags together.

       Tags come in two types:

       o Standalone tags - Can be placed only in the tag section that  follows
       the desription. There tags are not set off with curly braces: @tag.

       o  Inline  tags - Can be placed anywhere in the comments description or
       in the comments for standalone tags. Inline tags are set off with curly
       braces:{@tag}.

       For  information  about tags we might introduce in future releases, see
       Proposed Tags.

       The current tags are:

       For custom tags, see the -tag option.

       @author name-text
              Adds an "Author" entry with the specified name-text to the  gen-
              erated  docs when the -author option is used.  A doc comment may
              contain multiple @author tags.  You can  specify  one  name  per
              @author  tag or multiple names per tag.  In the former case, the
              Javadoc tool inserts a comma (,) and space  between  names.   In
              the  latter case, the entire text is simply copied to the gener-
              ated document without being  parsed.   Therefore,  use  multiple
              names per line if you want a localized name separator other than
              a comma.

       @deprecated deprecated-text
              Adds a comment indicating that this API should no longer be used
              (even though it might continue to work).  javadoc moves the dep-
              recated-text ahead of the description, placing it in italics and
              preceding it with a bold warning: "Deprecated".

              The  first  sentence of deprecated-text should at least tell the
              user when the API was deprecated and what to use as  a  replace-
              ment.   javadoc  copies  just  the first sentence to the summary
              section and index.  Subsequent sentences can also explain why it
              has  been  deprecated.   You  should  include a {@link} tag (for
              javadoc 1.2 or later) that points to the replacement API:


              o For javadoc 1.2, use a {@link} tag. This creates the link  in-
                line, where you want it. For example:

                     /**
                      * @deprecated  As of JDK 1.1, replaced by
                      *    {@link #setBounds(int,int,int,int)}
                      */


              o For  javadoc  1.1, the standard format is to create a @see tag
                (which cannot be in-line) for each @deprecated tag.

              For more about deprecation, see the @deprecated tag.

       {@code text}
              Equivalent to <code>{@literal}</code> .

       Displays text in code font without interpreting the text as HTML markup
       or  nested javadoc tags. This enables you to use regular angle brackets
       ( < and > ) instead of the HTML entities ( &lt; and &gt; ) in doc  com-
       ments, such as in parameter types ( <Object> ), inequalities ( 3 < 4 ),
       or arrows ( <- ). For example, the doc comment text:

            {@code A<B>C}

       displays in the generated HTML page unchanged as:

            A<B>C

       The noteworthy point is that the <B> is not interpreted as  boldand  is
       in code font.

       If  you  want  the same functionality without the code font, use {@lit-
       eral}.

       {@docRoot}
              Represents the relative path to the generated document's (desti-
              nation)  root  directory  from any generated page.  It is useful
              when you want to include a file, such as  a  copyright  page  or
              company  logo,  that  you  want  to reference from all generated
              pages.  Linking to the copyright page from the  bottom  of  each
              page is common.

              This  {@docRoot} tag can be used both on the command line and in
              a doc comment:

              1.  On the command  line,  where  the  header/footer/bottom  are
                  defined:

                  javadoc  -bottom  '<a href="{@docRoot}/copyright.html">Copy-
                  right</a>'

              NOTE - When using {@docRoot} this way in a make file, some make-
              file  programs require special escaping for the brace {} charac-
              ters. For example, the Inprise MAKE version 5.2 running on  Win-
              dows requires double braces: {{@docRoot}}. It also requires dou-
              ble (rather than single) quotes to enclose arguments to  options
              such  as -bottom (with the quotes around the href argument omit-
              ted).

              2.     In a doc comment:

                     /**
                     * See the <a href="{@docRoot}/copyright.html">Copyright</a>.
                     */

              The reason this tag is needed is because the generated docs  are
              in  hierarchical  directories, as deep as the number of subpack-
              ages.  This expression:

                   <a href="{@docRoot}/copyright.html">

              would resolve to:

                   <a       href="../../copyright.html">         ...       for
              java/lang/Object.java

              and

                   <a       href="../../../copyright.html">       ...      for
              java/lang/ref/Reference.java

       @exception class-name description
              The @exception tag is a synonym for @throws.

       {@inheritDoc}
              Inherits documentation from the nearest superclass into the cur-
              rent  doc  comment. This allows comments to be abstracted up the
              inheritance tree, and enables developers  to  write  around  the
              copied text. Also see inheriting comments.

       This tag can be placed in two positions:

       o      In  the comment body (before the first standalone tag), where it
              will copy the entire comment body from its superclass.

       o      In the text argument of a standalone tag, where it will copy the
              text of the tag from its superclass.

       {@link " package.class#member label" }
              Inserts  an  in-line link with visible text label that points to
              the documentation for the specified  package,  class  or  member
              name of a referenced class.

              This  tag is very similar to @see - both require the same refer-
              ences and accept exactly the same syntax for  package.class#mem-
              ber and label.  The main difference is that {@link} generates an
              in-line link rather than placing the link in the "See Also" sec-
              tion. Also, the {@link} tag begins and ends with curly braces to
              separate it from the rest of the in-line text. If  you  need  to
              use "}" inside the label, use the HTML entity notation &#125;

              There  is  no  limit  to the number of {@link} tags allowed in a
              sentence.  You can use this tag in the  description  part  of  a
              documentation comment or in the text portion of any tag (such as
              @deprecated, @return, or @param).

              For example, here is a comment that refers to  the  getComponen-
              tAt(int, int) method:

              Use the {@link #getComponentAt(int, int) getComponentAt} method.

              >From  this,  the  standard  doclet would generate the following
              HTML (assuming it refers to another class in the same package):

              Use the
              <a href="Component.html#getComponentAt(int, int)">\
                             getComponentAt</a>method.

              which appears on the web page as:

              Use the getComponentAt method.

              You can extend {@link} to link to classes not  being  documented
              by using the -link otion.

       {@linkplain " package.class#member label"}
              Indentical  to  {@link}, except the link's label is displayed in
              plain text than code font. Useful when the label is plain  text.
              Example:

       Refer to {@linkplain add() the overridden method}.

       This would display as

       Refer to the overridden method.


       {@literal text}
              Displays  text  without  interpreting the text as HTML markup or
              nested javadoc tags. This  enables  you  to  use  regular  angle
              brackets  (  <  and  > ) instead of the HTML entities ( &lt; and
              &gt; ) in doc comments, such as in parameter types ( <Object> ),
              inequalities  ( 3 < 4 ), or arrows ( <- ).  For example, the doc
              comment text:

            {@literal A<B>C}

       displays unchanged in the generated HTML page in your browser, as:

            A<B>C

       The noteworthy point is that the <B> is not interpreted as bold(and  it
       is not in code font).

       If  you want the same functionality but with the text in code font, use
       {@code} .

       @param parameter-name description
              Adds a parameter with the specified parameter-name  followed  by
              the  specified  description  to  the "Parameters" section.  When
              writing the doc comment, you may continue the  description  onto
              multiple  lines.   This tag is valid only in a doc comment for a
              method, constructor or class.

       The parameter-name can be the name of a parameter in a method  or  con-
       structor,  or the name of a type parameter of a class. Use angle brack-
       ets around this parametername to specify the use of a  type  parameter,
       such as:

            ,nf  /**  *  @param <E> Type of element stored in a list */ public
            interface List<E> extends Collection<E> { }

       For more details, see writing @param tags.

       @return description
              Adds a "Returns" section with the description text.   This  text
              should describe the return type and permissible range of values.

       @see <a href='URL#value'>label</a>
              Adds a link as defined by URL#value. The URL#value is a relative
              or  absolute URL. The Javadoc tool distinguishes this from other
              cases by looking for a less-than symbol (<) as the first charac-
              ter.  For example:

            @see <a href="spec.html#section">Java Spec</a>

       This generated a link such as:

            See Also: "Java Spec"

       @see string
              Adds  a text entry for string. No link is generated.  The string
              is a book or other reference to  information  not  available  by
              URL. The Javadoc tool distinguishes this from the previous cases
              by looking for a double-quote (") as the first  character.   For
              example:

                   @see "The Java Programming Language"

              This generates text such as:

                   See Also:
                        "The Java Programming Language"

       @see <a href="URL#value">label</a>
              Adds  a  link as defined by URL#value.  The URL#value is a rela-
              tive or absolute URL. The Javadoc tool distinguishes  this  from
              other  cases  by looking for a less-than symbol (<) as the first
              character.  For example:

                   @see <a href="spec.html#section">Java Spec</a>

              This generates a link such as:

                  See Also:
                        Java Spec

       @see package.class#member label
              Adds a link, with visible text label, that points to  the  docu-
              mentation  for  the  specified name in the Java Language that is
              referenced.  The label is optional; if omitted, the name appears
              instead  as the visible text, suitably shortened (see How a Name
              Is Displayed).  Use the label when you want the visible text  to
              be abbreviated or different from the name.

              In  version 1.2, just the name but not the label would automati-
              cally appear in <code> HTML  tags.   Starting  with  1.2.2,  the
              <code>  is  always  included around the visible text, whether or
              not a label is used.

              o package.class#member is any valid name in  the  Java  Language
                that  is  referenced  (package, class, interface, constructor,
                method, or field name), except that you replace the dot  ahead
                of the member name with a hash character (#).  If this name is
                in the documented classes, the Javadoc tool will automatically
                create  a  link to it.  To create links to external referenced
                classes, use the -link option.  Use either of  the  other  two
                @see  forms for referring to documentation of a name that does
                not belong to a referenced class.  This argument is  described
                at greater length below under Specifying a Name.

              o label  is  optional  text that is visible as the link's label.
                The label can contain white space.  If  a  label  is  omitted,
                then package.class.member will appear, suitably shortened rel-
                ative to the current class and package (see How a Name Is Dis-
                played).

              o A  space  is  the  delimiter  between package.class#member and
                label.  A space inside parentheses does not indicate the start
                of  a  label,  so  spaces  can be used between parameters in a
                method.

              Example - In this example, an @see tag (in the Character  class)
              refers  to  the  equals  method  in  the  String class.  The tag
              includes    both    arguments,     that     is,     the     name
              "String#equals(Object)" and the label "equals":

                    /**
                    * @see String#equals(Object) equals
                    */

              The standard doclet produces HTML something like this:

                  <dl>
                  <dt><b>See Also:</b>
                  <dd><a href="../../java/lang/String#equals\
                               (java.lang.Object)"><code>equals</code></a>
                  </dl>

              The  above  looks  something  like  this in a browser, where the
              label is the visible link text:

                   See Also:
                        equals

              Specifying a Name - This package.class#member name can be either
              fully qualified, such as java.lang.String#toUpperCase(), or not,
              such as String#toUpperCase() or #toUpperCase().   If  less  than
              fully-qualified,  the Javadoc tool uses the normal Java compiler
              search order to find it, further described below in Search order
              for  @see.   The name can contain whitespace within parentheses,
              such as between method arguments.

              Of course the advantage to providing shorter,  "partially-quali-
              fied"  names  is  that they are less to type and less clutter in
              the source code.  The following table shows the different  forms
              of  the  name, where Class can be a class or interface, Type can
              be a class, interface, array, or primitive, and method can be  a
              method or constructor.

              +-----------------------------------------------------------+
              The following notes apply to the above table:


              o The  first  set of forms (with no class or package) will cause
                the Javadoc tool to search only through  the  current  class's
                hierarchy.   It  will  find  a  member of the current class or
                interface, one of its superclasses or superinterfaces, or  one
                of its enclosing classes or interfaces (search steps 1-3).  It
                will not search the rest of the current package or other pack-
                ages (search steps 4-5).

              o If  any  method  or  constructor  is entered as a name with no
                parentheses, such as getValue, and if no field with  the  same
                name  exists, the Javadoc tool will correctly create a link to
                it, but will print a warning message reminding you to add  the
                parentheses  and arguments.  If this method is overloaded, the
                Javadoc tool links to the first method that its search encoun-
                ters, which is unspecified.

              o Nested  classes  must  be  specified  as outer.inner, not only
                inner, for all forms.

              o As stated, the hash character (#), rather than a dot (.), sep-
                arates a member from its class.  This enables the Javadoc tool
                to resolve ambiguities, since the dot also separates  classes,
                nested  classes,  packages,  and  subpackages.   However,  the
                Javadoc tool is generally lenient and will  properly  parse  a
                dot  if you know there is no ambiguity, though it will print a
                warning.

              Search Order for @see: The Javadoc tool will process an @see tag
              that  appears  in  a  source  file  (.java), package file (pack-
              age.html), or overview file (overview.html).  In the latter  two
              files, you must fully qualify the name you supply with @see.  In
              a source file, you can specify a name that is fully qualified or
              partially qualified.

              When  the  Javadoc  tool  encounters an @see tag in a .java file
              that is not fully qualified, it searches for the specified  name
              in the same order as the Java compiler would (except the Javadoc
              tool will not detect certain  namespace  ambiguities,  since  it
              assumes  the  source code is free of these errors).  This search
              order is formally defined in Chapter 6, "Names" of the Java Lan-
              guage  Specification,  Second Edition. The Javadoc tool searches
              for that name through all related and imported classes and pack-
              ages.  In particular, it searches in this order:


              1.  The current class or interface
              2.  Any  enclosing  classes  and  interfaces,  searching closest
                  first
              3.  Any  superclasses  and  superinterfaces,  searching  closest
                  first
              4.  The current package
              5.  Any  imported packages, classes and interfaces, searching in
                  the order of the import statement

              The Javadoc tool continues to search recursively  through  steps
              1-3  for  each class it encounters until it finds a match.  That
              is, after it searches through the current class and its  enclos-
              ing  class  E,  it  searches through E's superclasses before E's
              enclosing classes.  In steps 4 and 5, the Javadoc tool does  not
              search  classes  or interfaces within a package in any specified
              order (that order depends on the particular compiler).  In  step
              5,  the Javadoc tool will look in java.lang,sincethatisautomati-
              cally imported by all programs.

              The Javadoc tool won't necessarily look in subclasses, nor  will
              it  look  in other packages even if their documentation is being
              generated in the same run.  For example, if the @see tag  is  in
              java.awt.event.KeyEvent  class  and  refers  to  a  name  in the
              java.awt package, javadoc will not look in that  package  unless
              that class imports it.

              How  a  Name  is  Displayed  -  If  label is omitted, then pack-
              age.class.member will appear.  In general, it will  be  suitably
              shortened relative to the current class and package.  By "short-
              ened", we mean the Javadoc tool will display  only  the  minimum
              name necessary.  For example, if the String.toUpperCase() method
              contains references to a member of the same class and to a  mem-
              ber  of a different class, the class name will be displayed only
              in the latter case:

              @see tag   @see                          toLowerCase()
              refers     String#toLowerCase()          (omits the class name)
              to
              member
              of
              the
              same
              class

              @see       @see                          Character.toLowerCase(char)
              tag        Character#toLowerCase(char)   (includes the class name)
              refers
              to
              member
              of a
              differ-
              ent
              class

              Examples of @see: The comment to the right shows  how  the  name
              would  be  displayed  if  the  @see tag is in a class in another
              package, such as java.applet.Applet:



              Example                                  See also:

              @see java.lang.String                    // String

              @see String                              // String
              @see String#equals(Object)               // String.equals(Object)
              @see String#equals                       // String.equals\
                                                             (java.lang.Object)
              @see java.lang.Object#wait(long)         // java.lang.Object.\
                                                             wait(long)

                                                             Language"

       You can extend @see to link to classes not being documented
              by using the -link option.

       @since since-text
              Adds a "Since" heading with the specified since-text to the gen-
              erated  documentation.   The text has no special internal struc-
              ture.  This tag means that this change or  feature  has  existed
              since  the  software  release  specified by the since-text.  For
              example:

              @since 1.4

       For source code in the Java platform, this tag indicated the version of
       the  Java platform API specification (not necessarily when it was added
       to the reference implementation).

       @serial field-description|include|exclude
              Used in the doc comment for a default serializable field.

              An optional field-description augments the doc comment  for  the
              field.  The combined description must explain the meaning of the
              field and list the acceptable values.  If needed,  the  descrip-
              tion  can  span  multiple  lines.  The standard doclet adds this
              information to the serialized form page.

              The include and exclude arguments identify whether  a  class  or
              package  should be included or excluded from the serialized form
              page. They work as follows:


              o A public or protected class that implements
                Serializable is included unless the class (or its package)  is
                marked @serial exclude.

              o A private or package-private class that implements
                Serializable is excluded unless that class (or its package) is
                marked @serial include.

              Examples: The javax.swing package is marked @serial exclude  (in
              package.html).  The  public class java.sercurity.BasicPermission
              is  marked   @serial   exclude.    The   package-private   class
              java.util.PropertyPermissionCollection    is    marked   @serial
              include.

              The tag @serial at a class level overrides @serial at a  package
              level.

              For  more information about how to use these tags, along with an
              example, see "Documenting Serializable Fields  and  Data  for  a
              Class,"  Section 1.6 of the Java Object Serialization Specifica-
              tion.  Also see the "Serialization FAQ," which covers the  ques-
              tions,  "Why do I see javadoc warnings stating that I am missing
              @serial tags? for private fields if I  am  not  running  javadoc
              with the -private switch?"


       @serialField field-name  field-type  field-description
              Documents  an  ObjectStreamField  component  of  a  Serializable
              class's serialPersistentFields  member.   One  @serialField  tag
              should be used for each ObjectStreamField component.

       @serialData data-description
              The  data-description  documents  the types and order of data in
              the serialized  form.   Specifically,  this  data  includes  the
              optional  data  written  by  the writeObject method and all data
              (including base classes) written by the  Externalizable.writeEx-
              ternal method.

              The  @serialData  tag  can  be  used  in the doc comment for the
              writeObject, readObject, writeExternal, and  readExternal  meth-
              ods.

       @throws class-name  description
              The  @throws  and @exception tags are synonyms.  Adds a "Throws"
              subheading to the generated documentation, with  the  class-name
              and  description text.  The class-name is the name of the excep-
              tion that may be thrown by the method.  If  this  class  is  not
              fully  specified, the Javadoc tool uses the search order to look
              up this class.  Multiple @throws tags can beused in a given  doc
              comment for the same or different exceptions.

       To  ensure that all checked exceptions are documented, if a @throws tag
       does not exist for an exception inthe throws clause, the  Javadoc  tool
       automatically  adds that exception to the HTML output (with no descrip-
       tion) as if it were documented with @throws tag.

       The @throws documentation is copied from an overridden method to a sub-
       class  only when the exception is explicitly declared in the overridden
       method. The same is true for copying  from  an  interfacemethod  to  an
       implementing  method.   You  can  use  {@inheritDoc} to force@throws to
       inherit documentation.

       For more details, see Writing @throws tags.

       {@value package.class#field}
              When {@value} is used (without any argument) in the doc  command
              of a static field, it displays the value of that constant:

            /**
            * The value of this constant is {@value}.
            */
            public static final String SCRIPT_START = "<script>"

       When used with argument package.class#field in any doc comment, it dis-
       plays the value of the specified constant:

            /**
            * Evaluates the script starting with {@value #SCRIPT_START}.
            */
            public String evalScript(String script) {
            }

       The argument package.class#field takes a form identical to that of  the
       @see argument, except that the member must be a static field.

       These  values  of  these  constants  are also displayed on the Constant
       Field Values page.

       @version version-text
              Adds a "Version" subheading with the specified  version-text  to
              the  generated  docs when the -version option is used.  The text
              has no special internal structure.  A doc comment may contain at
              most  one  @version tag.  Version normally refers to the version
              of the software (such as the Java  2  SDK)  that  contains  this
              class or member.

   Where Tags Can Be Used
       The  following  sections  describe  where the tags can be used.  Notice
       that these four tags can be used in  all  doc  comments:  @see,  @link,
       @since, @deprecated.

   Overview Documentation Tags
       Overview tags are tags that can appear in the documentation comment for
       the overview page, which resides in the  source  file  typically  named
       (overview.html).   Like  any  other  documentation comments, these tags
       must appear after the description.

       NOTE: The {@link} tag has a bug in overview documents in  version  1.2.
       Text appears properly but has no link. The {@docRoot} tag does not cur-
       rently work in overview documents.

   Package Documentation Tags
       Package tags are tags that can appear in the documentation comment  for
       a  package  (which  resides in the source file named package.html). The
       @serial tag can only be used here with the include or exclude argument.

OPTIONS
       The Javadoc tool uses doclets to determine  its  output.   The  Javadoc
       tool  uses the default standard doclet unless a custom doclet is speci-
       fied with the -doclet option.  The Javadoc tool provides a set of  com-
       mand-line  options that can be used with any doclet.  These options are
       described below under the sub-heading Javadoc  Options.   The  standard
       doclet  provides  an  additional  set  of command-line options that are
       described below, under the sub-heading Options Provided by the Standard
       Doclet.   All option names are case-insensitive, though their arguments
       can be case-sensitive.

       The options are:



              -1.1                     -help               -package
              -author                  -helpfile           -private

              -header                  -overview            windowtitle
              -version

   Javadoc Options
       -overview path/filename
              Specifies that javadoc should retrieve the text for the overview
              documentation  from the "source" file specified by path/filename
              and place it on the Overview page (overview-summary.html).   The
              path/filename is relative to the -sourcepath.

              While  you  can  use any name you want for filename and place it
              anywhere you want for path, a typical thing to do is to name  it
              overview.html  and  place it in the source tree at the directory
              that contains the topmost package directories.   In  this  loca-
              tion,  no path is needed when documenting packages, since -sour-
              cepath will point to this file.  For example, if the source tree
              for  the  java.lang package is /src/classes/java/lang/, then you
              could place the  overview  file  at  /src/classes/overview.html.
              See Real World Example.

              For  information  about the file specified by path/filename, see
              overview comment file.

              Notice that the overview page is created only if you  pass  into
              javadoc two or more package names.  For further explanation, see
              HTML Frames.

              The title on the overview page is set by -doctitle .

       -public
              Shows only public classes and members.

       -protected
              Shows only protected and public classes and  members.   This  is
              the default.

       -package
              Shows only package, protected, and public classes and members.

       -private
              Shows all classes and members.

       -help  Displays  the  online help, which lists these javadoc and doclet
              command line options.

       -doclet class
              Specifies the class file that starts the doclet used in generat-
              ing  the  documentation.   Use  the  fully-qualified name.  This
              doclet defines the content  and  formats  the  output.   If  the
              -doclet option is not used, javadoc uses the standard doclet for
              generating the default HTML format.  This class must contain the
              start(Root)  method.  The path to this starting class is defined
              by the -docletpath option.

              For example, to call the MIF doclet, use:

              -doclet com.sun.tools.doclets.mif.MIFDoclet

       -docletpath classpathlist
              Specifies the path to the doclet class file (specified with  the
              -doclet  option) and any jar files it depends on.  If the start-
              ing class file is in a jar file, then this specifies the path to
              that  jar  file, as shown in the example below.  You can specify
              an absolute path or a path relative to  the  current  directory.
              If  classpath  contains multiple paths or jar files, they should
              be separated with a colon (:) on Windows.  This  option  is  not
              necessary if the doclet is already in the search path.

              Example  of  path  to  jar file that contains the startig doclet
              class file. Notice the jar filename is included.

              -docletpath /home/user/mifdoclet/lib/mifdoclet.jar

              Example of path to starting doclet class file. Notice the  class
              filename is omitted.

              -docletpath /home/user/mifdoclet/classes/com/sun/tools/doclets/mif/


       -1.1   This  feature  has  been  removed  from Javadoc 1.4. There is no
              replacement for it.  This option created documentation with  the
              appearance  and  functionality  of  documentation  generated  by
              Javadoc 1.1 (including never supporting nested classes). If  you
              need this option, use Javadoc 1.2 or 1.3 instead.

       -sourcepath sourcepathlist
              Specifies the search paths for finding source files (.java) when
              passing package names or -subpackages into the javadoc  command.
              The sourcepathlist can contain multiple paths by separating them
              with a colon (:). The Javadoc tool will search in all  subdirec-
              tories  of  the  specified  paths.  Note that this option is not
              only used to located the source files being documented, but also
              to  find  source  files  that are not being documented but whose
              comments are inherited by the source files being documented.

              Note that you can use the -sourcepath option only  when  passing
              package  names  into  the  javadoc  command - it will not locate
              .java files passed into the javadoc command.  (To  locate  .java
              files,  cd  to  that directory or include the path ahead of each
              file, as shown at Documenting One or More Classes.)   If  -sour-
              cepath  is  omitted,  javadoc  uses  the  class path to find the
              source files (see -classpath).  Therefore,  the  default  -sour-
              cepath is the value of class path.  If -classpath is omitted and
              you are passing package names into javadoc, it looks in the cur-
              rent directory (and subdirectories) for the source files.

              Set  sourcepathlist to the root directory of the source tree for
              the package you are documenting.  For example, suppose you  want
              to  document  a  package called com.mypackage whose source files
              are located at:

                     /home/user/src/com/mypackage/*.java

              In  this  case,  you  would   specify   the   source   path   to
              /home/user/src,  the  directory that contains com/mypackage, and
              then supply the package name com.mypackage:

                     example% javadoc -sourcepath /home/user/src/ com.mypackage

              This is easy to remember by noticing that if you concatenate the
              value  of  the  source  path  and  the package name together and
              change the dot to a slash "/", you end up with the full path  to
              the package:

                     /home/user/src/com/mypackage
              To point to two source paths:

                     example% javadoc -sourcepath /home/user/src/:/home/user2/src com.mypackage


       -classpath classpathlist
              Specifies  the  paths where javadoc looks for referenced classes
              (.class files) - these  are  the  documented  classes  plus  any
              classes referenced by those classes.  The classpathlist can con-
              tain multiple paths by separating them with a  colon  (:).   The
              Javadoc  tool will search in all subdirectories of the specified
              paths.  Follow the instructions in class path documentation  for
              specifying classpathlist.

              If  -sourcepath  is omitted, the Javadoc tool uses -classpath to
              find the source files as well as class files (for backward  com-
              patibility).   Therefore,  if  you want to search for source and
              class files in separate paths, use both -sourcepath and  -class-
              path.

              For example, if you want to document com.mypackage, whose source
              files reside in the directory /home/user/src/com/mypackage,  and
              if this package relies on a library in /home/user/lib, you would
              specify:

                     example% javadoc -classpath /home/user/lib -sourcepath \
                                    /home/user/src com.mypackage

              As with other tools, if  you  do  not  specify  -classpath,  the
              Javadoc  tool  uses the CLASSPATH environment variable, if it is
              set.  If both are not set, the Javadoc tool searches for classes
              from the current directory.

              For an in-depth description of how the Javadoc tool uses -class-
              path to find user classes as it relates to extension classes and
              bootstrap classes, see How Classes Are Found.

       -bootclasspath classpathlist
              Specifies  the  paths  where the boot classes reside.  These are
              nominally the Java platform classes.  The bootclasspath is  part
              of  the  search path the Javadoc tool will use to look up source
              and class files.  See How Classes Are Found  for  more  details.
              Separate directories in classpathlist with colons (:).

       -extdirs dirlist
              Specifies the directories where extension classes reside.  These
              are any classes that use  the  Java  Extension  mechanism.   The
              extdirs  is part of the search path the Javadoc tool will use to
              look up source and class files.  See -classpath (above) for more
              details.  Separate directories in dirlist with colons (:).

       -verbose
              Provides more detailed messages while javadoc is running.  With-
              out the verbose option, messages appear for loading  the  source
              files,  generating  the  documentation  (one  message per source
              file), and sorting.  The verbose option causes the  printing  of
              additional  messages  specifying  the  number of milliseconds to
              parse each java source file.

       -quiet Shuts off non-error and non-warning messages, leaving  only  the
              warnings  and  errors  appear,  making them easier to view. Also
              suppresses the version string.

       -locale language_country_variant
              Important: The -locale option must be placed ahead (to the left)
              of  any  options  provided  by  the standard doclet or any other
              doclet. Otherwise, the navigation bars will appear  in  English.
              This is the only command-line option that is order-dependent.

              Specifies  the locale that javadoc uses when generating documen-
              tation.  The argument is the name of the locale, as described in
              java.util.Locale  documentation,  such as en_US (English, United
              States) or en_US_WIN (Windows variant).

              Specifying a locale causes javadoc to choose the resource  files
              of  that  locale  for  messages  (strings in the navigation bar,
              headings for lists and tables, help file contents,  comments  in
              stylesheet.css,  and  so  forth).  It also specifies the sorting
              order for lists sorted alphabetically, and the sentence  separa-
              tor  to  determine  the  end of the first sentence.  It does not
              determine the locale of the doc comment text  specified  in  the
              source files of the documented classes.

       -encoding name
              Specifies  the  source  file encoding name, such as EUCJIS/SJIS.
              If this option is not specified, the platform default  converter
              is used.

       -Jflag Passes  flag  directly  to  the  runtime  system  java that runs
              javadoc.  Notice there must be no space between the  J  and  the
              flag.   For  example, if you need to ensure that the system sets
              aside 32 megabytes of memory in which to process  the  generated
              documentation,  then  you  would call the -Xmx option of java as
              follows:

              example% javadoc -J-Xmx32m -J-Xms32m com.mypackage

              To tell what version of javadoc you are using, call the -version
              option of java:

              example% javadoc -J-version
              java version "1.2"
              Classic VM (build JDK-1.2-V, green threads, sunwjit)

              (The version number of the standard doclet appears in its output
              stream.)

   Options Provided by the Standard Doclet
       -d directory
              Specifies the destination directory where javadoc saves the gen-
              erated  HTML  files.   (The  "d" means "destination.")  Omitting
              this option causes the files to be saved to the  current  direc-
              tory.   The  value  directory can be absolute or relative to the
              current working directory.  As of 1.4, the destination directory
              is automatically created when javadoc is run.

              For  example,  the following generates the documentation for the
              com.mypackage   package   and   saves   the   results   in   the
              /home/user/doc/ directory:

              example% javadoc -d /home/user/doc com.mypackage

       -use   Includes  one  "Use" page for each documented class and package.
              The page describes what packages,  classes,  methods,  construc-
              tors,  and  fields  use  any  API of the given class or package.
              Given class C, things that use class C would include  subclasses
              of  C,  fields declared as C, methods that return C, and methods
              and constructors with parameters of type C.

              For example, look at what might appear on  the  "Use"  page  for
              String.  The getName() method in the java.awt.Font class returns
              type String.  Therefore, getName() uses  String,  and  you  will
              find that method on the "Use" page for String.

              Note that this documents only uses of the API, not the implemen-
              tation.  If a method uses String in its implementation but  does
              not take a string as an argument or return a string, that is not
              considered a "use" of String.

              You can access the generated "Use" page by first  going  to  the
              class or package, then clicking on the "Use" link in the naviga-
              tion bar.

       -version
              Includes the @version text in the generated docs.  This text  is
              omitted  by  default.   To tell what version of the Javadoc tool
              you are using, use the -J-version option.

       -author
              Includes the @author text in the generated docs.

       -splitindex
              Splits the index file into multiple files,  alphabetically,  one
              file  per  letter,  plus a file for any index entries that start
              with non-alphabetical characters.

       -windowtitle title
              Specifies the title to be placed in the HTML <title> tag.   This
              appears  in  the  window  title  and  in  any  browser bookmarks
              (favorite places) that someone  creates  for  this  page.   This
              title  should  not  contain any HTML tags, as the browser cannot
              properly interpret them.  Any internal  quotation  marks  within
              title might have to be escaped.  If -windowtitle is omitted, the
              Javadoc tool uses the value of -doctitle for this option.

              example% javadoc -windowtitle "Java 2 Platform" com.mypackage

       -doctitle title
              Specifies the title to be placed near the top  of  the  overview
              summary  file.   The  title  is  placed as a centered, level-one
              heading directly beneath the upper navigation  bar.   The  title
              may  contain  HTML  tags  and white space, though if it does, it
              must be enclosed in quotes.  Any internal quotation marks within
              title may have to be escaped.

              example% javadoc -doctitle "Java<sup><font size=
                                    TM</font></sup>" com.mypackage

       -title title
              This  option no longer exists.  It existed only in Beta versions
              of Javadoc 1.2.  It has been renamed to -doctitle.  This  option
              was  renamed to make it clear that it defines the document title
              rather than the window title.

       -header header
              Specifies the header text to be placed at the top of each output
              file.  The header is placed to the right of the upper navigation
              bar.  header may contain HTML tags and white space, though if it
              does,  it  must  be  enclosed in quotes.  Any internal quotation
              marks within header may have to be escaped.

       -footer footer
              Specifies the footer text to be placed at  the  bottom  of  each
              output  file.   The  footer  is placed to the right of the lower
              navigation bar.  footer may contain HTML tags and  white  space,
              though  if it does, it must be enclosed in quotes.  Any internal
              quotation marks within footer may have to be escaped.

       -bottom text
              Specifies the text to be placed at the  bottom  of  each  output
              file.   The  text is placed at the bottom of the page, below the
              lower navigation bar.  text may  contain  HTML  tags  and  white
              space,  though  if  it does, it must be enclosed in quotes.  Any
              internal quotation marks within text may have to be escaped.

       -link extdocURL
              Creates links to  existing  javadoc-generated  documentation  of
              external referenced classes.  It takes one argument.

              extdocURL  is the absolute or relative URL of the directory con-
              taining the external javadoc-generated documentation you want to
              link to. Examples are shown below. The package-list file must be
              found in  this  directory  (otherwise,  use  -linkoffline).  The
              Javadoc  tool reads the package names from the package-list file
              and then links to those packages at that URL. When  the  Javadoc
              tool is run, the extdocURL value is copied literally into the <A
              HREF> links that are created. Therefore, extdocURL must  be  the
              URL to the directory, not to a file.

              You  can  use an absolute link for extdocURL to enable your docs
              to link to a document on any website, or can use a relative link
              to  link only to a relative location. If relative, the value you
              pass in should be the relative path from the destination  direc-
              tory  (specified with -d ) to the directory containing the pack-
              ages being linked to.

              When specifying an absolute link you normally use an http: link.
              However,  if  you  want to link to a file system that has no web
              server, you can use a file: link -  however,  do  this  only  if
              everyone  wanting  to  access the generated documentation shares
              the same file system.

              You can specify multiple -link options in a given javadoc run to
              link to multiple documents.

              Choosing  between  -linkoffline  and  -link  -  One or the other
              option is appropriate when linking to an API  document  that  is
              external to the current javadoc run.

              Use  -link: when using a relative path to the external API docu-
              ment, or when using an absolute URL to the  external  API  docu-
              ment, if you shell does not allow a program to open a connection
              to that URL for reading.

              Use -linkoffline : when using an absolute URL  to  the  external
              API  document,  if your shell does not allow a program to open a
              connection to that URL for reading.  This can occur if  you  are
              behind a firewall and the document you want to link to is on the
              other side.

              Example using absolute links to the external docs  -  Let's  say
              you  want  to  link  to  the java.lang, java.io and other Java 2
              Platform packages at http://java.sun.com/j2se/1.4/docs/api.  The
              following   command  generates  documentation  for  the  package
              com.mypackage with links to the Java 2  Platform  packages.  The
              generated  documentation will contain links to the Object class,
              for example in the class trees. (Other options, such  as  -sour-
              cepath and -d , are not shown.)

                     % javadoc -link http://java.sun.com/j2se/1.4/docs/api com.mypackage

              Example  using  relative  links to the external docs - Let's say
              you have two packages whose docs are generated in different runs
              of  the Javadoc tool, and those docs are separated by a relative
              path.  In this example, the  packages  are  com.apipackage,  and
              API,  and  com.spipackage,  an  SPI (Service Provide Interface).
              YOu want the documentation to reside in  docs/api/com/apipackage
              and docs/spi/com/spipackage. Assuming the API package documenta-
              tion is already generated, and that docs is the  current  direc-
              tory,  you  would document the SPI package with links to the API
              documentation by running:

                     % javadoc -d ./spi -link ../api com.spipackage

              Notice the -link argument is relative to the destination  direc-
              tory (docs/spi).

              Details - The -link option enables you to link to classes refer-
              enced to by your code but not documented in the current  javadoc
              run.   For these links to go to valid pages, you must know where
              those HTML pages are located, and  specify  that  location  with
              extdocURL  .   This allows, for instance, third party documenta-
              tion to link to java.* documentation on http://java.sun.com.

              Omit the -link option for javadoc to create links  only  to  API
              within  the  documentation  it is generating in the current run.
              (Without the -link option, the  Javadoc  tool  does  not  create
              links  to documentation for external references, because it does
              not know if or where that documentation exists.

              This option can create links in several places in the  generated
              documentation.

              Another use is for cross-links between sets of packages: Execute
              javadoc on one set  of  packages,  then  run  javadoc  again  on
              another  set  of packages, creating links both ways between both
              sets.  A third use is  as  a  "hack"  to  update  docs:  Execute
              javadoc  on  a  full  set of packages, then run javadoc again on
              only the smaller set of changed packages, so  that  the  updated
              files can be inserted back into the original set.

              Bug  Fix  for  Referenced Classes - In 1.4 the following bug has
              been fixed:

                     Link bug in 1.2 and 1.3 - When @see or {@link}
                     references an excluded class and -link is used,
                     an <A HREF> hyperlink is created only if the class is referenced
                     with in an import statement or in a declaration. References
                     in the body of methods, alone are inadequate. A workaround
                     was to include an explicit (not wildcard) import
                     statement for the referenced class.

              An @see or {@link} reference with -link is now  enough  to  load
              the referenced class and enable a link to it. You can remove any
              import statements you had added as  workarounds,  which  we  had
              suggested you comment as follows:

                     import java.lang.SecurityManager; // workaround to force @see/@link\
                                           hyperlink

              Package List - The -link option requires that a file named pack-
              age-list, which is generated by the Javadoc tool, exist  at  the
              URL  you  specify with -link.  The package-list file is a simple
              text file that lists the names of packages  documented  at  that
              location.   In  an earlier example, the Javadoc tool looks for a
              file named package-list at the given URL, reads in  the  package
              names and then links to those packages at that URL.

              For  example, the package list for the Java Platform v1.4 API is
              located at

                     http://java.sun.com/products/jdk/1.2/docs/\
                                    api/package-list

              and starts out as follows:

                     java.applet
                     java.awt
                     java.awt.color
                     java.awt.datatransfer
                     java.awt.dnd
                     java.awt.event
                     java.awt.font
                     etc.

              When javadoc is run without the -link option, when it encounters
              a  name  that belongs to an external referenced class, it prints
              the name with no link.  However, when the -link option is  used,
              the Javadoc tool searches the package-list file at the specified
              extdocURL location for that package name.  If it finds the pack-
              age name, it prefixes the name with extdocURL .

              In  order for there to be no broken links, all of the documenta-
              tion for the external references must  exist  at  the  specified
              URLs.  The  Javadoc  tool does not check that these pages exist,
              only that the package-list exists.

              Multiple Links: - You can supply multiple-link options  to  link
              to  any number of external generated documents.  Javadoc 1.2 has
              a known bug that prevents you from supplying more than one -link
              command.  This was fixed in 1.2.2.

              Specify  a  different  link option for each external document to
              link to:

                     example% javadoc -link extdocURL1 -link extdocURL2 ... \
                        -link extdocURLn com.mypackage

              where extdocURL1, extdocURL2,   ...   extdocURLn  point  respec-
              tively  to  the  roots of external documents, each of which con-
              tains a file named package-list.

              Cross-links - Note that "bootstrapping"  may  be  required  when
              cross-linking  two  or  more documents that have not been previ-
              ously generated.  In other words, if package-list does not exist
              for  either document, when you run the Javadoc tool on the first
              document, the package-list does not yet  exist  for  the  second
              document.   Therefore,  to  create  the external links, you must
              rree-generate the first document  after  generating  the  second
              document.

              In  this  case, the purpose of first generating a document is to
              create its package-list (or you can create it by hand if you are
              certain  of  the package names).  Then generate the second docu-
              ment with its external links. The Javadoc tool prints a  warning
              if a needed external package-list file does not exist.

       -linkoffline extdocURL  packagelistLoc
              This  option  is  a varition of -link; they both create links to
              javadoc-generated documentation for external referenced classes.
              Use  the  -linkoffline  option when linking to a document on the
              web when the Javadoc tool itself is "offline" - that is, it can-
              not access the document through a web connection.

              More  specifically,  use -linkoffline is the external document's
              package-list file is not accessible or does  not  exist  at  the
              extdocURL location but does exist at a different location, which
              can be specified by packageListLoc (typically local).  Thus,  is
              extdocURL is accessible only on the World Wide Web, -linkoffline
              removes the constraint that the Javadoc tool have a web  connec-
              tion  when  generating  the  documentation.  Examples  are given
              below.

              The -linkoffline option takes two arguments - the first for  the
              string  to be embedded in the <a href> links, the second telling
              it where to find package-list:


                     o extdocURL is the absolute or relative URL of the direc-
                       tory containing the external javadoc-generated documen-
                       tation you want to link to.   If  relative,  the  value
                       should be the relative path from the destination direc-
                       tory (specified with -d ) to the root of  the  packages
                       being linked to.  For more details see extdocURL in the
                       -link option.

                     o packagelistLoc is the path or URL to the directory con-
                       taining the package-list file for the external documen-
                       tation.  This can be a URL (http:  or  file:)  or  file
                       path,  and  can  be absolute or relative.  If relative,
                       make it relative to the current  directory  from  where
                       javadoc  was run. Do not include the package-list file-
                       name.

              You can specify multiple -linkoffline options in a given javadoc
              run.  (Prior to 1.2.2, it could be specified only once.)

              Example  using  absolute  links to the external docs - Let's say
              you want to link to the java.lang,  java.io  and  other  Java  2
              Platform  packages at http://java.sun.com/j2se/1.4/docs/api, but
              your shell does not have web access. You could open the package-
              list         file         in         a         browser        at
              http://java.sun.com/j2se/1.4/docs/api/package-list, save it to a
              local  directory,  and  point to this local copy with the second
              argument, packagelistLoc .  In this example,  the  package  list
              file  has been saved to the current directory "." .  The follow-
              ing command generates documentation for the package  com.mypack-
              age  with  links  to the Java 2 Platform packages. The generated
              documentation will contain links to the Object class, for  exam-
              ple,  in  the  class  trees.  (Other  necessary options, such as
              -sourcepath, are not shown.)

                     % javadoc -linkoffline http://java.sun.com/j2se/1.4/docs/api . com.mypackage

              Example using relative links to the external  docs  -  It's  not
              very  common  to  use  -linkoffline with relative paths, for the
              simple reason that -link usually suffices. When  using  -linkof-
              fline,  the package-list file is generally local, and when using
              relative links, the file you are linking to  is  also  generally
              local. So it is usually unnecessary to give a different path for
              the two arguments to -linkoffline .  When the two arguments  are
              identical,  you can use -link .  See the -link relative example.

              Manually Creating A package-list File - If a  package-list  file
              does  not  yet exist, but you know what package names your docu-
              ment will link to, you can create your own copy of this file  by
              hand  and  specify  its  path  with packagelistLoc .  An example
              would be the previous case where the package list  for  com.spi-
              package  did  not exist when com.apipackage was first generated.
              This technique is useful when you need to generate documentation
              that links to new external documentation whose package names you
              know, but which is not yet published. This is also a way of cre-
              ating package-list files for packages generated with Javadoc 1.0
              or 1.1, where package-list files were not generated.   Likewise,
              two  companies  can  share their unpublished package-list files,
              enabling them to release their cross-linked documentation simul-
              taneously.

              Linking  to  Multiple  Documents  - You can include -linkoffline
              once for each generated document you  want  to  refer  to  (each
              option is shown on a separate line for clarity):

                     example% javadoc  -linkoffline docURL1 packagelistURL1 \
                                       -linkoffline docURL2 packagelistURL2 \
                                       ...

              Updating  Docs - Another use for the -linkoffline option is use-
              ful if your project has dozens or hundreds of packages;  if  you
              have already run javadoc on the entire tree; and now, in a sepa-
              rate run, you want to quickly make some small changes and re-run
              javadoc  on  just  a  small portion of the source tree.  This is
              somewhat of a hack in  that  it  works  properly  only  if  your
              changes  are only to doc comments and not to signatures.  If you
              were to add, remove, or change any signatures  from  the  source
              code,  then  broken  links  could  show up in the index, package
              tree, inherited member lists, use page, or other places.

              First, you create a new destination directory (call  it  update)
              for  this  new small run. Set the first argument of -linkoffline
              to the current directory "." and set the second argument to  the
              relative  path to the original docs (call it html), where it can
              find package-list:

                     example% javadoc -d update -linkoffline . html com.mypackage

              When javadoc is done, copy these generated files (not the  over-
              view or index) in update over the original files in

       -linksource
              Creates  an HTML version of each source file (with line numbers)
              and adds links to them from  the  standard  HTML  documentation.
              This  option  exposes  all private implementation details in the
              included  source  files,  including  private  classes,   private
              fields,  and  the  bodies  of private methods, regardless of the
              -public, -package, -protected and -private options.  Unless  you
              also  use the -private option, not all private classes or inter-
              faces will necessarily be accessible via links.

       -group groupheading  packagepattern:packagepattern:...
              Separates packages on the overview page into whatever groups you
              specify,  one  group  per  table.  You specify each group with a
              different -group option.  The groups appear on the page  in  the
              order  specified  on the command line; packages are alphabetized
              within a group.  For a given -group option, the packages  match-
              ing  the  list  of  packagepattern expressions appear in a table
              with the heading groupheading.

              o groupheading can be any text, and  can  include  white  space.
                This text is placed in the table heading for the group.

              o packagepattern can be any package name, or can be the start of
                any package name followed by an asterisk (*).  The asterisk is
                a  wildcard  meaning "match any characters".  This is the only
                wildcard allowed.  Multiple patterns  can  be  included  in  a
                group by separating them with colons (:).

              NOTE:  If  using  an  asterisk in a pattern or pattern list, the
              pattern    list    must    be    inside    quotes,    such    as
              "java.lang*:java.util".

              If  you do not supply any -group option, all packages are placed
              in one group with the heading "Packages".  If the all groups  do
              not  include  all  documented  packages,  any  leftover packages
              appear in a separate group with the heading "Other Packages".

              For example, the following option separates the four  documented
              packages  into  core, extension, and other packages.  Notice the
              trailing "dot" does not appear in  "java.lang*";  including  the
              dot, such as "java.lang.*", would omit the java.lang package:

                     example% javadoc -group "Core Packages" "java.lang*:java.util" \
                         -group "Extension Packages" "javax.*" \
                         java.lang java.lang.reflect java.util javax.servlet java.new

              This results in the groupings:

                     Core Packages
                       java.lang
                       java.lang.reflect
                       java.util
                     Extension Packages
                       javax.servlet
                     Other Packages
                       java.new

       -nodeprecated
              Prevents the generation of any deprecated API at all in the doc-
              umentation.  This does what -nodeprecatedlist does, plus it does
              not generate any deprecated API throughout the rest of the docu-
              mentation.  This is useful when writing code and you don't  want
              to be distracted by the deprecated code.

       -nodeprecatedlist
              Prevents  the generation of the file containing the list of dep-
              recated APIs (deprecated-list.html) and the link in the  naviga-
              tion  bar to that page.  (However, javadoc continues to generate
              the deprecated API throughout the rest of the  document.)   This
              is  useful  if  your source code contains no deprecated API, and
              you want to make the navigation bar cleaner.

       -nosince
              Omits from the generated docs the  "Since"  sections  associated
              with the @since tags.

       -notree
              Omits  the  class/interface  hierarchy  from the generated docs.
              The hierarchy is produced by default.

       -noindex
              Omits the index from the generated docs.  The index is  produced
              by default.

       -nohelp
              Omits the HELP link in the navigation bars at the top and bottom
              of each page of output.

       -nonavbar
              Prevents the  generation  of  the  navigation  bar,  header  and
              footer,  otherwise  found at the top and bottom of the generated
              pages.  Has no effect on the  "bottom"  option.   The  -nonavbar
              option is useful when you are interested only in the content and
              have no need for navigation, such as  converting  the  files  to
              PostScript or PDF for print only.

       -helpfile path/filename
              Specifies  the path of an alternate help file path/filename that
              the HELP link in the top and bottom  navigation  bars  link  to.
              Without  this  option,  the Javadoc tool automatically creates a
              help file help-doc.html that is hard-coded in the Javadoc  tool.
              This  option enables you to override this default.  The filename
              can be any name and is  not  restricted  to  help-doc.html;  the
              Javadoc tool will adjust the links in the navigation bar accord-
              ingly.  For example:

                     example% javadoc -helpfile /home/doc/myhelp.html java.awt

       -stylesheetfile path/filename
              Specifies the path of an alternate HTML stylesheet file.   With-
              out  this  option,  the  Javadoc  tool  automatically  creates a
              stylesheet file,  stylesheet.css,  that  is  hard-coded  in  the
              Javadoc tool.  This option enables you to override this default.
              The  filename  can  be  any  name  and  is  not  restricted   to
              stylesheet.css.  For example:

                     example% javadoc -stylesheetfile \
                                 /home/user/mystylesheet.css com.mypackage

       -serialwarn
              Generates  compile-time  warnings  for missing @serial tags.  By
              default, Javadoc 1.2.2 (and later versions) generates no  serial
              warnings.  (This is a reversal from earlier versions.)  Use this
              option to display the serial warnings, which helps  to  properly
              document  default serializable fields and writeExternal methods.

       -charset name
              Specifies the HTML character set for this document.   For  exam-
              ple:

                     % javadoc -charset "iso-8859-1" mypackage

              would  insert  the following line in the head of every generated
              page:

              <META       http-equiv="Content-Type"        content="text/html;
              charset=iso-885 9-1">

              This  META  tag  is  described in the HTML standard (4197265 and
              4137321).

       -docencoding name
              Specifies the encoding of the generated HTML files.

       -keywords
              Adds HTML meta keyword tags  to  the  generated  file  for  each
              class.  These  tags can help the page be found by search engines
              that look for meta tags. (Most search engines  that  search  the
              entire Internet do not look at meta tags, because pages can mis-
              use them; but search engines offered by companies  that  confine
              their search to their own website can benefit by looking at meta
              tags.)

              The meta tags include the fully qualified name of the class  and
              theunqualified  names  of  the fields and methods.  Constructors
              arenot included because they are identical to  the  class  name.
              For example, the class String starts with these keywords:

                   <META NAME="keywords" CONTENT="java.lang.String class">
                   <META NAME="keywords" CONTENT="CASE_INSENSITIVE_ORDER">
                   <META NAME="keywords" CONTENT="length()">
                   <META NAME="keywords" CONTENT="charAt()">

       -tag tagname:Xaoptcmf:
              Enables  javadoc  to  interpret  a  simple,  one-argument custom
              standalone tag @tagname in doc comments. So the Javadoc tool can
              "spell-check"  tag  names,  it  is  important  to include a -tag
              option for every custom tag that is present in the source  code,
              disabling  (with  X) those that are not being output in the cur-
              rent run.

              The colon (:) is always the separator. To use a colon,  see  Use
              of Colon in Tag Name .

              The  -tag option outputs the tag's heading taghead in bold, fol-
              lowed on the next line by the text from its single argument,  as
              shown  in the example below. Like any standalone tag, this argu-
              ment's text can contain inline tags, which are also interpreted.
              The  output  is  similar  to standard one-argument tags, such as
              @return and @author.

              Placement of tags - The Xaoptcmf part of the argument determines
              where  in  the  source code the tag is allowed to be placed, and
              whether the tag can be disabled (using X). You can supply either
              a,  to  allow  the  tag in all places, or any combination of the
              other letters:

                     X (disable tag)
                     a (all)
                     o (overview)
                     p (packages)
                     t (types, that is classes and interfaces)
                     c (constructors)
                     m (methods)
                     f (fields)

              Examples of single tags - An example of a tag option for  a  tag
              that can be used anywhere in the source code is:

                     -tag todo:a:"To Do:"

              If  you  wanted @todo to be used only with constructors, methods
              and fields, you would use:

                     -tag todo:cmf:"To Do:"

              Notice the last colon (:) above is not  a  parameter  separator,
              but  is part of the heading text (as shown below). You would use
              either tag option for source code that contains the  tag  @todo,
              such as:

                     @todo The documentation for this method needs work.

              This line would produce output something like:

                     To Do:
                                       The documentation for this method needs work.


              Use of Colon in Tag Name -
              A colon can be used in a tag name if it
              is escaped with a backslash. For this comment:

                   /**
                   * @ejb:bean
                   */

              use this tag option:

                   -tag ejb\:bean:a:"EJB"

              Spell-checking  tag names (Disabling tags) - Some developers put
              custom tags in the source code that they don't  always  want  to
              output.  In  these  cases, it is important to list all tags that
              are present in the source code, enabling the ones  you  want  to
              output  and  disabling  the  ones  you don't want to output. The
              presence of X disables the tag, while its  absence  enables  the
              tag. This gives the Javadoc tool enough information to know if a
              tag it encounters is unknown, probably the results of a typo  or
              a misspelling. It prints a warning in these cases.

              You  can  add X to the placement values already present, so that
              when you want to enable the tag, you can simply  delete  the  X.
              For example, if @todo is a tag that you want to suppress on out-
              put, you would use:

                     -tag todo:Xcmf:"To Do:"

              or, if you'd rather keep it simple:

                     -tag todo:X

              The syntax -tag todo:X works even  if  @todo  is  defined  by  a
              taglet.

              Order  of  tags  -  The order of the -tag (and -taglet ) options
              determine the order the tags are output. You can mix the  custom
              tags with the standard tags to intersperse them. The tag options
              for standard tags are  placeholders  only  for  determining  the
              order  --  they  take only the standard tag's name. (Subheadings
              for standard tags cannot be altered.) This is illustrated in the
              following example.

              If  -tag is missing, then the position of -taglet determines its
              order. If they are both present, then whichever appears last  on
              the command line determines its order. (This happens because the
              tags and taglets are processed in the order that they appear  on
              the command line. For example, if -taglet and -tag both have the
              name "todo", the one that appears last on the command line  will
              determine its order.

              Example of a complete set of tags - This example inserts "To Do"
              after "Parameters" and before "Throws" in the output.  By  using
              "X",  it  also  specifies  that  @example is a tag that might be
              encountered in the source code that should not be output  during
              this  run. Notice that if you use @argfile, you can put the tags
              on separate lines in an argument file like this (no line contin-
              uation characters needed):

                     -tag param
                     -tag return
                     -tag todo:a:"To Do:"
                     -tag throws
                     -tag see
                     -tag example:X

              When  javadoc  parses the doc comments, any tag encountered that
              is neither a standard tag nor passed in with -tag or -taglet  is
              considered unknown, and a warning is thrown.

              The  standard  tags are initially stored internally in a list in
              their default order.  Whenever -tag options are used, those tags
              get  appended to this list -- standard tags are moved from their
              default position.  Therefore, if a -tag option is omitted for  a
              standard tag, it remains in its default position.

              Avoiding  Conflicts  -  If you want to slice out your own names-
              pace, you can use a dot-separated naming convention  similar  to
              that used for packages: com.mycompany.todo. Sun will continue to
              create standard tags whose names do not contain  dots.  Any  tag
              you  create will override the behavior of a tag by the same name
              defined by Sun. In other words, if you create a  tag  or  taglet
              @todo, it will always have the same behavior you define, even if
              Sun later creates a standard tag of the same name.

              You can also create more  complex  standalone  tags,  or  custom
              inline tags with the -taglet option.

       -taglet class
              Specifies the class file that starts the taglet used in generat-
              ing the documentation for that tag. Use the fully-qualified name
              for  class.   This  taglet also defines the number of text argu-
              ments that the custom tag has. The taglet  accepts  those  argu-
              ments,  processes  them, and generates the output. For extensive
              documentation with example taglets, see Taglet Overview.

              Taglets are useful for standalone or inline tags.  They can have
              any  number  of arguments and implement custom behavior, such as
              making text bold, formatting bullets, writing out the text to  a
              file, or starting other processes.

              Use  the  -tagletpath  option to specify the path to the taglet.
              Here is an example that inserts the "To Do" taglet after "Param-
              eters" and ahead of "Throws" in the generated pages:

                     -taglet com.sun.tools.doclets.ToDoTaglet
                     -tagletpath /home/taglets
                     -tag return
                     -tag param
                     -tag todo
                     -tag throws
                     -tag see

              Alternatively,  you  can  use the -taglet option in place of its
              -tag option, but that may be harder to read.

       -tagletpath tagletpathlist
              Specifies the  search  paths  for  finding  taglet  class  files
              (.class). The tagletpathlist can contain multiple paths by sepa-
              rating them with a colon (:). The Javadoc tool  will  search  in
              all subdirectories of the specified paths.

       -subpackages package1:package2:...
              Generates documentation from source files in the specified pack-
              ages and recursively in their subpackages. This option is useful
              when  adding  new  subpackages  to  the source code, as they are
              automatically included. Each package is  any  top-level  package
              (java)  or fully qualified subpackage javax.swing), and does not
              need to contain source  files.   Wildcards  are  not  needed  or
              allowed.  Use -sourcepath to specify where to find the packages.
              For example:

                     % javadoc -d docs -sourcepath /home/user/src \
                                       -subackages java:javax.swing

              This command generates documentation for  packages  name  "java"
              and "javax.swing" and all their subpackages.

              There  is  also an option to exclude subpackages as it traverses
              the subpackages.

       -exclude packagename1:packagename2:...
              Unconditionally excludes the specified packages and  their  sub-
              packages from the list formed by -subpackages if they would oth-
              erwise be  included  by  some  previous  or  later  -subpackages
              option. For example:

                     % javadoc -sourcepath /home/user/src -sourcepath java\
                                       -exclude java.net:java.lang

              would  include java.io, java.util, and java.math (among others),
              but would exclude packages rooted  at  java.net  and  java.lang.
              Notice  this excludes java.lang.ref, a subpackage of java.lang).

       -breakiterator
              Uses    the    internationalized    sentence     boundary     of
              java.text.BreakIterator  to  determine the end of the first sen-
              tence for English (all other locales already  use  BreakIterator
              ),  rather  than an English language, locale-specific algorithm.
              By first sentence, we  mean  the  first  sentence  in  the  main
              desription  of  a  package,  class  or member.  This sentence is
              copied to the package, class  or  member  summary,  and  to  the
              alphabetic index.

              From JDK 1.2 forward, the BreakIterator class is already used to
              determine the end of sentence for  all  languages  but  English.
              Therefore,  the  -breakiterator  option has no effect except for
              English from 1.2 forward. English had its own default algorithm:

              o      English  default  sentence  break  algorithm - Stops at a
                     period followed by a space or a HTML block tag,  such  as
                     <P>.

              o      Breakiterator  sentence  break  algorithm  -  Stops  at a
                     period, question mark or exclamation mark followed  by  a
                     space if the next word starts with a capital letter. This
                     is meant to  handle  most  abbreviations  (such  as  "The
                     serial  no.  is  valid",  but  won't handle "Mr. Smith").
                     Won't stop at HTML tags or sentences that begin with num-
                     bers  or  symbols.  Stops at the last period in "../file-
                     name", even if embedded in an HTML tag.

              NOTE: We have removed from 1.5.0 the breakiterator warning  mes-
              sages  that  were  in  1.4.x and have left the default sentence-
              break algorithm unchanged. That is, the -breakiterator option is
              not  the  default  in  1.5.0,  nor do we expect it to become the
              default. This is a reversal from our former intention  that  the
              default  would  change in the "next major release" (1.5.0). This
              means if you have not modified your source code to eliminate the
              breakiterator  warnings in 1.4.x, then you don't have to do any-
              thing, and the warnings go away starting with 1.5.0. The  reason
              for this reversal is because any benefit to having breakiterator
              become the default  would  be  outweighed  by  the  incompatible
              source  change  it  would  require. We regret any extra work and
              confusion this has caused.

       -docfilessubdirs
              Enables deep  copying  of  "doc-files"  directories.   In  other
              words, subdirectories and all contents are recursively copied to
              the destination.  For  example,  the  directory  doc-files/exam-
              ple/images  and  all its contents would now be copied.  There is
              also an option to exclude subdirectories.

       -excludedocfilessubdirs name1:name2:...
              Excludes any "doc-files" subdirectories with  the  given  names.
              This  prevents the copying of SCCS and other source-code-control
              subdirectories.

       -noqualifier all | packagename1:packagename2:...
              Omits qualifying package name from ahead of class names in  out-
              put.  The  argument to -noqualifier is either "all" (all package
              qualifiers are omitted) or a colon-separate  list  of  packages,
              with wildcards, to be removed as qualifiers. The package name is
              removed from places where class or interface names appear.

              The following example omits all package qualifiers:

                     -noqualifier all

              The following example omits "java.lang"  and  "java.io"  package
              qualifiers:

                     -noqualifier java.lang:java.io

              The  following  example  omits  package qualifiers starting with
              "java", and "com.sun" subpackages (but not "javax"):

                     -noqualifier java.*:com.sun.*

              Where a package qualifier would appear due to the  above  behav-
              ior,  the  following behavior (present in 1.3) also takes effect
              to further omit qualifiers: On the page for  class  p.C,  remove
              the  package qualifier for classes belonging to package p.  This
              rule is present whether or not -noqualifier is used.

       -notimestamp
              Suppresses the timestamp, which is hidden in an HTML comment  in
              the  generated  HTML near the top of each page.  Useful when you
              want to run javadoc on two source bases and  diff  them,  as  it
              prevents  timestamps  from causing a diff (which would otherwise
              be a diff on every page). The  timestamp  includes  the  javadoc
              version number,and currently looks like this:

                    <!-- Generated by javadoc (build 1.5.0-internal)
                    on Tue Jun 22 09:57:24 PDT 2004 -->

       -nocomment
              Suppress  the entire comment body, including the description and
              all tags, generating only declarations. This option enables  re-
              using  source files originally intended for a different purpose,
              to produce a skeleton perhaps for a new project.

   Command Line Argument Files
       To shorten or simplify the javadoc command line, you can specify one or
       more  files  that  themselves  contain arguments to the javadoc command
       (except -J options).  This enables you to create  javadoc  commands  of
       any length on any operating system.

       An  argument  file  can  include  Javadoc options, source filenames and
       package names in any combination, or just arguments to Javadoc options.
       The  arguments  within  a  file can be space-separated or newline-sepa-
       rated. Filenames within an argument file are relative  to  the  current
       directory, not the location of the argument file. Wildcards (*) are not
       allowed in these lists (such as for specifying *.java).  Use of the '@'
       character  to  recursively  interpret  files  is  not supported. The -J
       options are not supported because they  are  passed  to  the  launcher,
       which does not support argument files.

       When executing javadoc, pass in the path and name of each argument file
       with the '@' leading character. When  javadoc  encounters  an  argument
       beginning  with the character '@', it expands the contents of that file
       in the argument list.

       Example - Single Arg File

       You could use a single  argument  file  named  "argfile"  to  hold  all
       Javadoc arguments:

              % javadoc @argfile

       This  argument  file  could contain the contents of both files shown in
       the next example.

       Example - Two Arg Files

       You can create two argument files - one for the Javadoc options and the
       other  for the package names or source filenames: (Notice the following
       lists have no line-continuation characters.)

       Create a file named "options" containing:

              -d docs-filelist
              -use
              -splitindex
              -windowtitle 'Java 2 Platform v1.3 API Specification'
              -doctitle 'Java<sup><font size="-2">TM</font></sup> 2\
                                Platform v1.4 API Specification'
              -header '<b>Java 2 Platform </b><br><font size="-1">v1.4</font>'
              -bottom 'Copyright 1993-2000 Sun Microsystems, Inc. All Rights Reserved.'
              -group "Core Packages" "java.*"
              -overview /java/pubs/ws/1.3/src/share/classes/overview-core.html
              -sourcepath /java/pubs/ws/1.3/src/share/classes

       Create a file named "packages" containing:

              com.mypackage1
              com.mypackage2
              com.mypackage3

       You would then run javadoc with:

              % javadoc @options @packages

       Example - Arg Files with Paths

       The argument files can have paths, but any filenames inside  the  files
       are relative to the current working directory (not path1 or path2):

              % javadoc @path1/options @path2/packages

       Examples - Option Arguments

       Here's  an example of saving just an argument to a javadoc option in an
       argument file.  We'll use the -bottom  option,  since  it  can  have  a
       lengthy argument. You could create a file named "bottom" containing its
       text argument:

       Submit a bug or feature</a><br><br>Java is a  trademark  or  registered
       trademark  of  Sun  Microsystems,  Inc.  in  the  US  and  other  coun-
       tries.<br>Copyright 1993-2000 Sun Microsystems, Inc.  901  San  Antonio
       Road,<br>Palo    Alto,    California,   94303,   U.S.A.    All   Rights
       Reserved.</font>'

       The run the Javadoc tool with:

              % javadoc -bottom @bottom @packages

       Or you could include the -bottom option at the start  of  the  argument
       file, and then just run it as:

              % javadoc @bottom @packages


       RUNNING

   Running Javadoc
       Version Numbers -

       The  version  number  of javadoc can be determined using javadoc-J-ver-
       sion.  The version number of the standard doclet appears in its  output
       stream. It can be turned off with -quiet .

       Public programmatic interface -

       To  invoke  the  Javadoc  tool from within programs written in the Java
       language. This interface is in om.sun.tools.javadoc.Main  (and  javadoc
       is re-entrant). For
        more details, see Standard Doclet.

SIMPLE EXAMPLES
       You  can  run  javadoc  on  entire packages or individual source files.
       Each package name has a corresponding directory name.  In the following
       examples,  the  source  files  are located at /home/src/java/awt/*java.
       The destination directory is /home/html.

   Documenting One or More Packages
       To document a package, the source files (*.java) for that package  must
       be  located  in  a directory having the same name as the package.  If a
       package name is made up of several identifiers (separated by dots, such
       as  java.awt.color),  each  subsequent  identifier must correspond to a
       deeper subdirectory (such as java/awt/color).  You may split the source
       files  for  a  single package among two such directory trees located at
       different places, as long as -sourcepath points  to  them  both  -  for
       example src1/java/awt/color and src2/java/awt/color.

       You  can  run  javadoc  either  by changing directories (with cd) or by
       using -sourcepath option.  The examples below illustrate both  alterna-
       tives.

       o Case  1  -  Run recursively starting from one or more packages - This
         example uses -sourcepath so javadoc can be run from any directory. It
         traverses  the  subpackages  of  java  excluding  packages  rooted at
         java.net and java.lang.  Notice this excludes java.lang.ref,  a  sub-
         package of java.lang).

              % javadoc -d /home/html -sourcepath /home/src\
                                -subpackages java -exclude java.net:java.lang

       To  also  traverse  down other package trees, append their names to the
       -subpackages argument, such as java:javax:org.xml.sax.

       o Case 2 - Run on explicit packages after changing to the 'root' source
         directory  -  Change  to  the parent directory of the fully qualified
         package.  Then run javadoc, supplying names of one or  more  packages
         you want to document:

              example% cd /home/src/
              example% javadoc -d /home/html java.awt java.awt.event

       o Case  3  -  Run  from  any directory on explicit packages in a single
         directory tree - In this case, it does not matter  what  the  current
         directory  is.   Run  javadoc  supplying  -sourcepath with the parent
         directory of the top-level package, and supplying  names  of  one  or
         more packages you want to document:

              example% javadoc -d /home/html -sourcepath /home/src \
                         java.awt java.awt.event

       o Case  4  -  Run  from  any directory on explicit packages in multiple
         directory trees - This is the same as case 3,  but  for  packages  in
         separate directory trees.  Run javadoc supplying -sourcepath with the
         path to each tree's root (colon-separated) and supply names of one or
         more  packages  you  want  to  document. All source files for a given
         package do not need to be located under a  single  root  directory  -
         they just need to be found somewhere along the sourcepath.

              % javadoc -d /home/html -sourcepath\
                                /home/src1:/home/src2 java.awt java.awt.event

       Result:  All cases generate HTML-formatted documentation for the public
       and  protected  classes  and  interfaces  in  packages   java.awt   and
       java.awt.event  and  save  the  HTML files in the specified destination
       directory (/home/html).  Because two or more packages are being  gener-
       ated, the document has three frames: for the list of packages, the list
       of classes, and the main page.

   Documenting One or More Classes
       The second way to run the Javadoc tool is by passing  in  one  or  more
       source  files (.java).  You can run javadoc either of the following two
       ways: by changing directories (with cd) or by fully specifying the path
       to  the .java files.  Relative paths are relative to the current direc-
       tory.  The -sourcepath option is ignored when passing in source  files.
       You  can  use  command line wildcards, such as asterisk (*), to specify
       groups of classes.

       o Case 1 - Changing to the source directory - Change to  the  directory
         holding the .java files.  Then run javadoc, supplying names of one or
         more source files you want to document.

              example% cd /home/src/java/awt
              example% javadoc -d /home/html Button.java Canvas.java \
                             Graphics*.java

         This example generates HTML-formatted documentation for  the  classes
         Button,  Canvas, and classes beginning with Graphics.  Because source
         files rather than package  names  were  passed  in  as  arguments  to
         javadoc,  the  document  has two frames - for the list of classes and
         the main page.

       o Case 2 - Changing to the package root directory - This is useful  for
         documenting  individual  source  files from different subpackages off
         the same root.  Change to the package root directory, and supply  the
         source files with paths from the root.

              example% cd /home/src/
              example% javadoc -d /home/html java/awt/Button.java \
                               java/applet/Applet.java

         This  example  generates HTML-formatted documentation for the classes
         Button and Applet.

       o Case 3 - From any directory - In this case, it  doesn't  matter  what
         the  current  directory is.  Run javadoc, supplying the absolute path
         (or path relative to the current directory) to the  .java  files  you
         want to document:

              example% javadoc -d /home/html /home/src/java/awt/Button.java \
                             /home/src/java/awt/Graphics*.java

         This  example  generates  HTML-formatted  documentation for the class
         Button and classes beginning with Graphics.

   Documenting Both Packages and Classes
       You can document entire packages and individual  classes  at  the  same
       time.   Here  is  an example that mixes the two previous examples.  You
       can use -sourcepath for the path to the packages but not for  the  path
       to the individual classes:

              example% javadoc -d /home/html -sourcepath /home/src java.awt \
                             /home/src/java/applet/Applet.java

       This  example  generates  HTML-formatted  documentation for the package
       java.awt and class Applet.  The Javadoc  tool  determines  the  package
       name   for  Applet  from  the  package  declaration,  if  any,  in  the
       Applet.java source file.)

   Real World Example
       The Javadoc tool has many useful options, some of which are  more  com-
       monly  used  than  others.  Here is effectively the command you need to
       run the Javadoc tool on the Java platform API. We use 180MB  of  memory
       to  generate  the  documentation for the 1500 (approx.) public and pro-
       tected classes in the Java 2 Platform, Standard Edition, v1.2.

       The same example is shown twice - first  as  executed  on  the  command
       line,  then  as  execued from a makefile. It uses absolute paths in the
       option arguments, which enables the same javadoc command to be run from
       any directory.

   Command Line Example
       This  command  line  example  is over 900 characters, which is too long
       from some shells, such as DOS.  You can use  a  command  line  argument
       file (or write a shell script) to workaround this limitation.

              example% javadoc -sourcepath /jdk/src/share/classes \
              -overview /java/jdk/src/share/classes/overview.html \
              -d /jdk/build/api -use -splitIndex -windowtitle 'Java 2 Platform v1.2 API Specification' \
              -doctitle 'Java<sup><font size="-2">TM</font></sup> 2 Platform v1.2 API Specification ' \

       where  packages  is  the  name  of  a  file  containing the packages to
       process, such as java.applet, java.lang.  None of  the  options  should
       contain any newline characters between the single quotes. (For example,
       if you copy and paste this example, delete the newline characters  from
       the -bottom option.) See the other notes listed below.

   Makefile Example
       This is an example of a GNU makefile. For an example of a Windows make-
       file, see creating a makefile for Windows.

              example% javadoc -sourcepath /jdk/src/share/classes /* Sets path for
                                                                  source files  */
              -overview $ (SRCDIR)/overview.html /* Sets path for overview text */
              -d /jdk/build/api           /* Sets destination directory */
              -use                        /* Adds "Use" files      */
              -splitIndex                 /* Splits index A-Z      */
              -windowtitle $(WINDOWTITLE) /* Adds a window title   */
              -doctitle $(DOCTITLE)       /* Adds a doc title      */
              -header $(HEADER)           /* Adds running header text       */
              -bottom $(BOTTOM)           /* Adds text at bottom            */
              -group $(GROUPCORE)         /* 1st subhead on overview page */
              -group $(GROUPEXT)          /* 2nd subhead on overview page  */
              -J-Xmx180m                           /* Sets memory to 180MB     */
              java.lang java.lang.reflect          /* Sets packages to document  */
              java.util java.io java.net           java.applet

              Single quotes are used to surround makefile arguments.

   Notes
       o If you omit the -windowtitle option, the Javadoc tool copies the  doc
         title  to  the  window  title. The -windowtitle text is basically the
         same as the -doctitle but without HTML tags, to  prevent  those  tags
         from appearing as raw text in the window title).

       o If you omit the -footer option, as done here, the Javadoc tool copies
         the header text to the footer.

       Other important options you might wan to use but
         not needed in this example are -classpath and -link.


TROUBLESHOOTING
   General Troubleshooting
       o Javadoc FAQ - Commonly-encountered bugs and troubleshooting tips  can
         be found on the Javadoc FAQ

       o Bugs and Limitations - You can also see some bugs listed at Important
         Bug Fixes and Changes.

       o Version number - See version numbers.

       o Documents only legal classes - When documenting  a  package,  javadoc
         only  reads  files whose names are composed of legal class names. You
         can prevent javadoc from parsing a file by including, for example,  a
         hyphen "-" in its filename.

   Errors and Warnings
       Error  and warning messages contain the filename and line number to the
       declaration line rather than to the particular line in the doc comment:

       o "error:  cannot read: Class1.java" the Javadoc tool is trying to load
         the class Class1.java in the current directory.  The  class  name  is
         shown with its path (absolute or relative), which in this case is the
         same as ./Class1.java.

ENVIRONMENT
       CLASSPATH           Environment variable that provides the  path  which
                           javadoc  uses to find user class files.  This envi-
                           ronment variable is overridden  by  the  -classpath
                           option.   Separate  your  directories with a colon,
                           for example:

                      .:/home/classes:/usr/local/java/classes
