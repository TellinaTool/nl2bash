XCODE-SELECT(1)           BSD General Commands Manual          XCODE-SELECT(1)



NAME
       xcode-select - Manages the active developer directory for Xcode and BSD
       tools.

SYNOPSIS
       xcode-select   [-h|--help]   [-s|--switch   <path>]   [-p|--print-path]
       [-v|--version]

DESCRIPTION
       xcode-select  controls  the location of the developer directory used by
       xcrun(1), xcodebuild(1), cc(1), and other  Xcode  and  BSD  development
       tools. This also controls the locations that are searched for by man(1)
       for developer tool manpages.

       This allows you to easily switch  between  different  versions  of  the
       Xcode  tools  and  can be used to update the path to the Xcode if it is
       moved after installation.

   Usage
       When multiple Xcode  applications  are  installed  on  a  system  (e.g.
       /Applications/Xcode.app,  containing  the  latest  Xcode, and /Applica-
       tions/Xcode-DP.app containing a  developer  preview)  use  xcode-select
       --switch  path/to/Xcode.app  to  specify the Xcode that you wish to use
       for command line developer tools.

       After setting a developer directory, all of the  xcode-select  provided
       developer  tool shims (see FILES) will automatically invoke the version
       of the tool inside the selected developer directory. Your own  scripts,
       makefiles, and other tools can also use xcrun(1) to easily lookup tools
       inside the active developer directory, making it easy  to  switch  them
       between  different  versions  of  the  Xcode tools and allowing them to
       function properly on systems  where  the  Xcode  application  has  been
       installed to a non-default location.

OPTIONS
       -h, --help
              Prints the usage message.

       -s <path>, --switch <path>
              Sets the active developer directory to the given path, for exam-
              ple /Applications/Xcode-DP.app. This command must  be  run  with
              superuser  permissions  (see sudo(8)), and will affect all users
              on the system. To set the path without superuser permissions  or
              only  for the current shell session, use the DEVELOPER_DIR envi-
              ronment variable instead (see ENVIRONMENT).

       -p, --print-path
              Prints the path to the currently selected  developer  directory.
              This  is  useful  for  inspection,  but  scripts and other tools
              should use xcrun(1) to locate tool inside the  active  developer
              directory.

       -r, --reset
              Unsets  any  user-specified  developer  directory,  so  that the
              developer directory will be found via the default search  mecha-
              nism.  This  command must be run with superuser permissions (see
              sudo(8)), and will affect all users on the system.

       -v, --version
              Prints xcode-select version information.

       --install
              Opens a user interface dialog to request automatic  installation
              of the command line developer tools.

ENVIRONMENT
       DEVELOPER_DIR
          Overrides the active developer directory. When DEVELOPER_DIR is set,
          its value will be used instead of the system-wide  active  developer
          directory.

          Note  that for historical reason, the developer directory is consid-
          ered to be the Developer content directory inside the Xcode applica-
          tion  (for  example /Applications/Xcode.app/Contents/Developer). You
          can set the environment variable to either the actual Developer con-
          tents   directory,   or  the  Xcode  application  directory  --  the
          xcode-select provided shims will automatically convert the  environ-
          ment variable into the full Developer content path.

EXAMPLES
       xcode-select --switch /Applications/Xcode.app/Contents/Developer
          Select   /Applications/Xcode.app/Contents/Developer  as  the  active
          developer directory.

       xcode-select --switch /Applications/Xcode.app
          As above, selects /Applications/Xcode.app/Contents/Developer as  the
          active developer directory. The Developer content directory is auto-
          matically inferred by xcode-select.

       /usr/bin/xcodebuild
          Runs xcodebuild out of the active developer directory.

       /usr/bin/xcrun --find xcodebuild
          Use xcrun to locate xcodebuild inside the  active  developer  direc-
          tory.

       env DEVELOPER_DIR="/Applications/Xcode-DP.app" /usr/bin/xcodebuild
          Execute xcodebuild using an alternate developer directory.

FILES
       /usr/bin/xcrun
          Used  to  find  or  run arbitrary commands from the active developer
          directory. See xcrun(1) for more information.

          tory.
