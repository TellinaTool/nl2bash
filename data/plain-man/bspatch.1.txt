BSPATCH(1)                BSD General Commands Manual               BSPATCH(1)

NAME
     bspatch -- apply a patch built with bsdiff(1)

SYNOPSIS
     bspatch <oldfile> <newfile> <patchfile>

DESCRIPTION
     bspatch generates <newfile> from <oldfile> and <patchfile> where
     <patchfile> is a binary patch built by bsdiff(1).

     bspatch uses memory equal to the size of <oldfile> plus the size of
     <newfile>, but can tolerate a very small working set without a dramatic
     loss of performance.
