DESCRIPTION
       spfquery checks if a given set of e-mail parameters (e.g., the SMTP
       sender's IP address) matches the responsible domain's Sender Policy
       Framework (SPF) policy.  For more information on SPF see
       <http://www.openspf.org>.

   Preferred Usage
       The following usage forms are preferred over the legacy forms used by
       older spfquery versions:

       The --identity form checks if the given ip-address is an authorized
       SMTP sender for the given "helo" hostname, "mfrom" envelope sender
       e-mail address, or "pra" (so-called purported resonsible address)
       e-mail address, depending on the value of the --scope option (which
       defaults to mfrom if omitted).

       The --file form reads "ip-address identity [helo-identity]" tuples from
       the file with the specified filename, or from standard input if
       filename is -, and checks them against the specified scope (mfrom by
       default).

       Both forms support an optional --versions option, which specifies a
       comma-separated list of the SPF version numbers of SPF records that may
       be used.  1 means that "v=spf1" records should be used.  2 means that
       "spf2.0" records should be used.  Defaults to 1,2, i.e., uses any SPF
       records that are available.  Records of a higher version are preferred.

   Legacy Usage
       spfquery versions before 2.500 featured the following usage forms,
       which are discouraged but still supported for backwards compatibility:

       The --helo form checks if the given ip-address is an authorized SMTP
       sender for the "HELO" hostname given as the identity (so-called "HELO"
       check).

       The --mfrom form checks if the given ip-address is an authorized SMTP
       sender for the envelope sender email-address (or domain) given as the
       identity (so-called "MAIL FROM" check).  If a domain is given instead
       of an e-mail address, "postmaster" will be substituted for the
       localpart.

       The --pra form checks if the given ip-address is an authorized SMTP
       sender for the PRA (Purported Responsible Address) e-mail address given
       as the identity.

   Other Usage
       The --version form prints version information of spfquery.  The --help
       form prints usage information for spfquery.

OPTIONS
   Standard Options
       The preferred and legacy forms optionally take any of the following
       OPTIONS:

       --default-explanation string
       --def-exp string
           Use the specified string as the default explanation if the
           authority domain does not specify an explanation string of its own.

       --hostname hostname
           Use hostname as the host name of the local system instead of auto-
           detecting it.

       --keep-comments
       --no-keep-comments
           Do (not) print any comments found when reading from a file or from
           standard input.

       --sanitize (currently ignored)
       --no-sanitize (currently ignored)
           Do (not) sanitize the output by condensing consecutive white-space
           into a single space and replacing non-printable characters with
           question marks.  Enabled by default.

       --debug (currently ignored)
           Print out debug information.

   Black Magic Options
       Several options that were supported by earlier versions of spfquery are
       considered black magic (i.e. potentially dangerous for the innocent
       user) and are thus disabled by default.  If the Mail::SPF::BlackMagic
       Perl module is installed, they may be enabled by specifying
       --enable-black-magic.

       --max-dns-interactive-terms n
           Evaluate a maximum of n DNS-interactive mechanisms and modifiers
           per SPF check.  Defaults to 10.  Do not override the default unless
           you know what you are doing!

       --max-name-lookups-per-term n
           Perform a maximum of n DNS name look-ups per mechanism or modifier.
           Defaults to 10.  Do not override the default unless you know what
           you are doing!

       --authorize-mxes-for email-address|domain,...
           Consider all the MXes of the comma-separated list of email-
           addresses and domains as inherently authorized.

       --tfwl
           Perform "trusted-forwarder.org" accreditation checking.

       --guess spf-terms
           Use spf-terms as a default record if no SPF record is found.

       --local spf-terms
           Process spf-terms as local policy before resorting to a default
           result (the implicit or explicit "all" mechanism at the end of the
           domain's SPF record).  For example, this could be used for white-
           listing one's secondary MXes: "mx:mydomain.example.org".

       --override domain=spf-record
       --fallback domain=spf-record
           Set overrides and fallbacks.  Each option can be specified multiple
           times.  For example:

               --override example.org='v=spf1 -all'
               --override '*.example.net'='v=spf1 a mx -all'
               --fallback example.com='v=spf1 -all'

RESULT CODES
       pass        The specified IP address is an authorized SMTP sender for
                   the identity.

       fail        The specified IP address is not an authorized SMTP sender
                   for the identity.

       softfail    The specified IP address is not an authorized SMTP sender
                   for the identity, however the authority domain is still
                   testing out its SPF policy.

       neutral     The identity's authority domain makes no assertion about
                   the status of the IP address.

       permerror   A permanent error occurred while evaluating the authority
                   domain's policy (e.g., a syntax error in the SPF record).
                   Manual intervention is required from the authority domain.

       temperror   A temporary error occurred while evaluating the authority
                   domain's policy (e.g., a DNS error).  Try again later.

       none        There is no applicable SPF policy for the identity domain.

EXIT CODES
         Result    | Exit code
        -----------+-----------
         pass      |     0
         fail      |     1
         softfail  |     2
         neutral   |     3
         permerror |     4
         temperror |     5
         none      |     6

EXAMPLES
           spfquery --scope mfrom --id user@example.com --ip 1.2.3.4
           spfquery --file test_data
           echo "127.0.0.1 user@example.com helohost.example.com" | spfquery -f -

COMPATIBILITY
       spfquery has undergone the following interface changes compared to
       earlier versions:

       2.500
           o   A new preferred usage style for performing individual SPF
               checks has been introduced.  The new style accepts a unified
               --identity option and an optional --scope option that specifies
               the type (scope) of the identity.  In contrast, the legacy
               usage style requires a separate usage form for every supported
               scope.  See "Preferred usage" and "Legacy usage" for details.

           o   The former "unknown" and "error" result codes have been renamed
               to "permerror" and "temperror", respectively, in order to
               comply with RFC 4408 terminology.

           o   SPF checks with an empty identity are no longer supported.  In
               the case of an empty "MAIL FROM" SMTP transaction parameter,
               perform a check with the "helo" scope directly.

           o   The --debug and --(no-)sanitize options are currently ignored
               by this version of spfquery.  They will again be supported in
               the future.

           o   Several features that were supported by earlier versions of
               spfquery are considered black magic and thus are now disabled
               by default.  See "Black Magic Options".

           o   Several option names have been deprecated.  This is a list of
               them and their preferred synonyms:

                 Deprecated options  | Preferred options
                ---------------------+-----------------------------
                 --sender, -s        | --mfrom
                 --ipv4, -i          | --ip-address, --ip
                 --name              | --hostname
                 --max-lookup-count, | --max-dns-interactive-terms
                   --max-lookup      |
                 --rcpt-to, -r       | --authorize-mxes-for
                 --trusted           | --tfwl
