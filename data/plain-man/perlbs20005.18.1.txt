NAME
       perlbs2000 - building and installing Perl for BS2000.

SYNOPSIS
       This document will help you Configure, build, test and install Perl on
       BS2000 in the POSIX subsystem.

DESCRIPTION
       This is a ported perl for the POSIX subsystem in BS2000 VERSION OSD
       V3.1A or later.  It may work on other versions, but we started porting
       and testing it with 3.1A and are currently using Version V4.0A.

       You may need the following GNU programs in order to install perl:

   gzip on BS2000
       We used version 1.2.4, which could be installed out of the box with one
       failure during 'make check'.

   bison on BS2000
       The yacc coming with BS2000 POSIX didn't work for us.  So we had to use
       bison.  We had to make a few changes to perl in order to use the pure
       (reentrant) parser of bison.  We used version 1.25, but we had to add a
       few changes due to EBCDIC.  See below for more details concerning yacc.

   Unpacking Perl Distribution on BS2000
       To extract an ASCII tar archive on BS2000 POSIX you need an ASCII
       filesystem (we used the mountpoint /usr/local/ascii for this).  Now you
       extract the archive in the ASCII filesystem without I/O-conversion:

       cd /usr/local/ascii export IO_CONVERSION=NO gunzip <
       /usr/local/src/perl.tar.gz | pax -r

       You may ignore the error message for the first element of the archive
       (this doesn't look like a tar archive / skipping to next file...), it's
       only the directory which will be created automatically anyway.

       After extracting the archive you copy the whole directory tree to your
       EBCDIC filesystem.  This time you use I/O-conversion:

       cd /usr/local/src IO_CONVERSION=YES cp -r /usr/local/ascii/perl5.005_02
       ./

   Compiling Perl on BS2000
       There is a "hints" file for BS2000 called hints.posix-bc (because
       posix-bc is the OS name given by `uname`) that specifies the correct
       values for most things.  The major problem is (of course) the EBCDIC
       character set.  We have german EBCDIC version.

       Because of our problems with the native yacc we used GNU bison to
       generate a pure (=reentrant) parser for perly.y.  So our yacc is really
       the following script:

       -----8<-----/usr/local/bin/yacc-----8<----- #! /usr/bin/sh

       # Bison as a reentrant yacc:

       # save parameters: params="" while [[ $# -gt 1 ]]; do
           params="$params $1"
           shift done

       # add flag %pure_parser:

       tmpfile=/tmp/bison.$$.y echo %pure_parser > $tmpfile cat $1 >> $tmpfile

       # call bison:

       echo "/usr/local/bin/bison --yacc $params $1\t\t\t(Pure Parser)"
       /usr/local/bin/bison --yacc $params $tmpfile

       # cleanup:

       rm -f $tmpfile -----8<----------8<-----

       We still use the normal yacc for a2p.y though!!!  We made a softlink
       called byacc to distinguish between the two versions:

       ln -s /usr/bin/yacc /usr/local/bin/byacc

       We build perl using GNU make.  We tried the native make once and it
       worked too.

   Testing Perl on BS2000
       We still got a few errors during "make test".  Some of them are the
       result of using bison.  Bison prints parser error instead of syntax
       error, so we may ignore them.  The following list shows our errors,
       your results may differ:

       op/numconvert.......FAILED tests 1409-1440 op/regexp...........FAILED
       tests 483, 496 op/regexp_noamp.....FAILED tests 483, 496
       pragma/overload.....FAILED tests 152-153, 170-171
       pragma/warnings.....FAILED tests 14, 82, 129, 155, 192, 205, 207
       lib/bigfloat........FAILED tests 351-352, 355
       lib/bigfltpm........FAILED tests 354-355, 358
       lib/complex.........FAILED tests 267, 487 lib/dumper..........FAILED
       tests 43, 45 Failed 11/231 test scripts, 95.24% okay. 57/10595 subtests
       failed, 99.46% okay.

   Installing Perl on BS2000
       We have no nroff on BS2000 POSIX (yet), so we ignored any errors while
       installing the documentation.

   Using Perl in the Posix-Shell of BS2000
       BS2000 POSIX doesn't support the shebang notation
       ("#!/usr/local/bin/perl"), so you have to use the following lines
       instead:

       : # use perl
           eval 'exec /usr/local/bin/perl -S $0 ${1+"$@"}'
               if $running_under_some_shell;

   Using Perl in "native" BS2000
       We don't have much experience with this yet, but try the following:

       Copy your Perl executable to a BS2000 LLM using bs2cp:

       "bs2cp /usr/local/bin/perl 'bs2:perl(perl,l)'"

       Now you can start it with the following (SDF) command:

       "/START-PROG FROM-FILE=*MODULE(PERL,PERL),PROG-MODE=*ANY,RUN-MODE=*ADV"

       First you get the BS2000 commandline prompt ('*').  Here you may enter
       your parameters, e.g. "-e 'print "Hello World!\\n";'" (note the double
       backslash!) or "-w" and the name of your Perl script.  Filenames
       starting with "/" are searched in the Posix filesystem, others are
       searched in the BS2000 filesystem.  You may even use wildcards if you
       put a "%" in front of your filename (e.g. "-w checkfiles.pl %*.c").
       Read your C/C++ manual for additional possibilities of the commandline
       prompt (look for PARAMETER-PROMPTING).

   Floating point anomalies on BS2000
       There appears to be a bug in the floating point implementation on
       BS2000 POSIX systems such that calling int() on the product of a number
       and a small magnitude number is not the same as calling int() on the
       quotient of that number and a large magnitude number.  For example, in
       the following Perl code:

           my $x = 100000.0;
           my $y = int($x * 1e-5) * 1e5; # '0'
           my $z = int($x / 1e+5) * 1e5;  # '100000'
           print "\$y is $y and \$z is $z\n"; # $y is 0 and $z is 100000

       Although one would expect the quantities $y and $z to be the same and
       equal to 100000 they will differ and instead will be 0 and 100000
       respectively.

   Using PerlIO and different encodings on ASCII and EBCDIC partitions
       Since version 5.8 Perl uses the new PerlIO on BS2000.  This enables you
       using different encodings per IO channel.  For example you may use

           use Encode;
           open($f, ">:encoding(ascii)", "test.ascii");
           print $f "Hello World!\n";
           open($f, ">:encoding(posix-bc)", "test.ebcdic");
           print $f "Hello World!\n";
           open($f, ">:encoding(latin1)", "test.latin1");
           print $f "Hello World!\n";
           open($f, ">:encoding(utf8)", "test.utf8");
           print $f "Hello World!\n";

       to get two files containing "Hello World!\n" in ASCII, EBCDIC, ISO
       Latin-1 (in this example identical to ASCII) respective UTF-EBCDIC (in
       this example identical to normal EBCDIC).  See the documentation of
       Encode::PerlIO for details.

       As the PerlIO layer uses raw IO internally, all this totally ignores
       the type of your filesystem (ASCII or EBCDIC) and the IO_CONVERSION
       environment variable.  If you want to get the old behavior, that the
       BS2000 IO functions determine conversion depending on the filesystem
       PerlIO still is your friend.  You use IO_CONVERSION as usual and tell
       Perl, that it should use the native IO layer:

           export IO_CONVERSION=YES
           export PERLIO=stdio

       Now your IO would be ASCII on ASCII partitions and EBCDIC on EBCDIC
       partitions.  See the documentation of PerlIO (without "Encode::"!)  for
       further possibilities.
