NAME
     uname -- Print operating system name

SYNOPSIS
     uname [-amnprsv]

DESCRIPTION
     The uname utility writes symbols representing one or more system charac-
     teristics to the standard output.

     The following options are available:

     -a      Behave as though all of the options -mnrsv were specified.

     -m      print the machine hardware name.

     -n      print the nodename (the nodename may be a name that the system is
             known by to a communications network).

     -p      print the machine processor architecture name.

     -r      print the operating system release.

     -s      print the operating system name.

     -v      print the operating system version.

     If no options are specified, uname prints the operating system name as if
     the -s option had been specified.
