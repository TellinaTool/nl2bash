LASTCOMM(1)               BSD General Commands Manual              LASTCOMM(1)

NAME
     lastcomm -- show last commands executed in reverse order

SYNOPSIS
     lastcomm [-f file] [command ...] [user ...] [terminal ...]

DESCRIPTION
     lastcomm gives information on previously executed commands.  With no
     arguments, lastcomm prints information about all the commands recorded
     during the current accounting file's lifetime.

     Option:

     -f file     Read from file rather than the default accounting file.

     If called with arguments, only accounting entries with a matching command
     name, user name, or terminal name are printed.  So, for example:

           lastcomm a.out root ttyd0

     would produce a listing of all the executions of commands named a.out by
     user root on the terminal ttyd0.

     For each process entry, the following are printed.

           o   The name of the user who ran the process.
           o   Flags, as accumulated by the accounting facilities in the sys-
               tem.
           o   The command name under which the process was called.
           o   The amount of cpu time used by the process (in seconds).
           o   The time the process started.
           o   The elapsed time of the process.

     The flags are encoded as follows: ``S'' indicates the command was exe-
     cuted by the super-user, ``F'' indicates the command ran after a fork,
     but without a following exec(3), ``C'' indicates the command was run in
     PDP-11 compatibility mode (VAX only), ``D'' indicates the command termi-
     nated with the generation of a core file, and ``X'' indicates the command
     was terminated with a signal.

FILES
     /var/account/acct  Default accounting file.
