filebyproc.d(1m)                 USER COMMANDS                filebyproc.d(1m)



NAME
       filebyproc.d - snoop opens by process name. Uses DTrace.

SYNOPSIS
       filebyproc.d

DESCRIPTION
       filebyproc.d  is  a DTrace OneLiner to print file pathnames as they are
       opened, including the name of the process calling  the  open.   A  line
       will  be  printed regardless of whether the open is actually successful
       or not.

       This is useful to learn which  files  applications  are  attempting  to
       open, such as config files, database files, log files, etc.

       Docs/oneliners.txt   and  Docs/Examples/oneliners_examples.txt  in  the
       DTraceToolkit contain this as a oneliner that  can  be  cut-n-paste  to
       run.

       Since  this  uses  DTrace, only users with root privileges can run this
       command.

EXAMPLES
       This prints new process name and pathnames until Ctrl-C is hit.
              # filebyproc.d

              pathname.


DOCUMENTATION

       tory. The DTraceToolkit docs may include full worked examples with ver-
       bose descriptions explaining the output.
