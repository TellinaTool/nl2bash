       glevel] [-H ldapuri] [-h ldaphost]  [-n]  [-p ldapport]  [-S]  [-s new-

DESCRIPTION
       ldappasswd  is  a tool to set the password of an LDAP user.  ldappasswd
       uses the LDAPv3 Password Modify (RFC 3062) extended operation.

       ldappasswd sets the password of associated with the user [or an option-
       ally specified user].  If the new password is not specified on the com-
       mand line and the user doesn't enable prompting,  the  server  will  be
       asked to generate a password for the user.

       ldappasswd  is  neither  designed  nor intended to be a replacement for
       passwd(1) and should not be installed as such.

OPTIONS
       -A     Prompt for old password.  This is used instead of specifying the
              password on the command line.

       -a oldPasswd
              Set the old password to oldPasswd.

       -t oldPasswdFile
              Set the old password to the contents of oldPasswdFile.

       -x     Use simple authentication instead of SASL.

       -D binddn
              Use the Distinguished Name binddn to bind to the LDAP directory.
              For SASL binds, the server is expected to ignore this value.

       -d debuglevel
              Set the LDAP debugging level to debuglevel.  ldappasswd must  be
              compiled  with  LDAP_DEBUG  defined  for this option to have any
              effect.

       -H ldapuri
              Specify URI(s) referring to the ldap server(s); only the  proto-
              col/host/port  fields  are  allowed; a list of URI, separated by
              whitespace or commas is expected.

       -h ldaphost
              Specify an alternate host on which the ldap server  is  running.
              Deprecated in favor of -H.

       -p ldapport
              Specify  an  alternate TCP port where the ldap server is listen-
              ing.  Deprecated in favor of -H.

       -n     Do not set password. (Can be useful  when  used  in  conjunction
              with -v or -d)

       -S     Prompt for new password.  This is used instead of specifying the
              password on the command line.

       -s newPasswd
              Set the new password to newPasswd.

       -T newPasswdFile
              Set the new password to the contents of newPasswdFile.

       -v     Increase the verbosity of output.   Can  be  specified  multiple
              times.

       -W     Prompt  for  bind  password.  This is used instead of specifying
              the password on the command line.

       -w passwd
              Use passwd as the password to bind with.

       -y passwdfile
              Use complete contents of passwdfile as the password  for  simple
              authentication.

       -O security-properties
              Specify SASL security properties.

       -I     Enable  SASL  Interactive  mode.   Always prompt.  Default is to
              prompt only as needed.

       -Q     Enable SASL Quiet mode.  Never prompt.

       -U authcid
              Specify the authentication ID for SASL bind. The form of the  ID
              depends on the actual SASL mechanism used.

       -R realm
              Specify  the  realm of authentication ID for SASL bind. The form
              of the realm depends on the actual SASL mechanism used.

       -X authzid
              Specify the requested authorization ID for SASL  bind.   authzid
              must be one of the following formats: dn:<distinguished name> or
              u:<username>.

       -Y mech
              Specify the SASL mechanism to be  used  for  authentication.  If
              it's  not  specified, the program will choose the best mechanism
              the server knows.

       -Z[Z]  Issue StartTLS (Transport Layer Security) extended operation. If
              you  use  -ZZ, the command will require the operation to be suc-
              cessful
