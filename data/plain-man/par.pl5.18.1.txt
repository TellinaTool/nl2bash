NAME
       par.pl - Make and run Perl Archives

SYNOPSIS
       (Please see pp for convenient ways to make self-contained executables,
       scripts or PAR archives from perl programs.)

       To make a PAR distribution from a CPAN module distribution:

           % par.pl -p                 # make a PAR dist under the current path
           % par.pl -p Foo-0.01        # assume unpacked CPAN dist in Foo-0.01/

       To manipulate a PAR distribution:

           % par.pl -i Foo-0.01-i386-freebsd-5.8.0.par # install
           % par.pl -i http://foo.com/Foo-0.01         # auto-appends archname + perlver
           % par.pl -i cpan://AUTRIJUS/PAR-0.74        # uses CPAN author directory
           % par.pl -u Foo-0.01-i386-freebsd-5.8.0.par # uninstall
           % par.pl -s Foo-0.01-i386-freebsd-5.8.0.par # sign
           % par.pl -v Foo-0.01-i386-freebsd-5.8.0.par # verify

       To use Hello.pm from ./foo.par:

           % par.pl -A./foo.par -MHello
           % par.pl -A./foo -MHello    # the .par part is optional

       Same thing, but search foo.par in the @INC;

           % par.pl -Ifoo.par -MHello
           % par.pl -Ifoo -MHello      # ditto

       Run test.pl or script/test.pl from foo.par:

           % par.pl foo.par test.pl    # looks for 'main.pl' by default,
                                       # otherwise run 'test.pl'

       To make a self-containing script containing a PAR file :

           % par.pl -O./foo.pl foo.par
           % ./foo.pl test.pl          # same as above

       To embed the necessary non-core modules and shared objects for PAR's
       execution (like "Zlib", "IO", "Cwd", etc), use the -b flag:

           % par.pl -b -O./foo.pl foo.par
           % ./foo.pl test.pl          # runs anywhere with core modules installed

       If you also wish to embed core modules along, use the -B flag instead:

           % par.pl -B -O./foo.pl foo.par
           % ./foo.pl test.pl          # runs anywhere with the perl interpreter

       This is particularly useful when making stand-alone binary executables;
       see pp for details.

DESCRIPTION
       This stand-alone command offers roughly the same feature as "perl
       -MPAR", except that it takes the pre-loaded .par files via "-Afoo.par"
       instead of "-MPAR=foo.par".

       Additionally, it lets you convert a CPAN distribution to a PAR
       distribution, as well as manipulate such distributions.  For more
       information about PAR distributions, see PAR::Dist.

   Binary PAR loader (parl)
       If you have a C compiler, or a pre-built binary package of PAR is
       available for your platform, a binary version of par.pl will also be
       automatically installed as parl.  You can use it to run .par files:

           # runs script/run.pl in archive, uses its lib/* as libraries
           % parl myapp.par run.pl     # runs run.pl or script/run.pl in myapp.par
           % parl otherapp.pl          # also runs normal perl scripts

       However, if the .par archive contains either main.pl or script/main.pl,
       it is used instead:

           % parl myapp.par run.pl     # runs main.pl, with 'run.pl' as @ARGV

       Finally, the "-O" option makes a stand-alone binary executable from a
       PAR file:

           % parl -B -Omyapp myapp.par
           % ./myapp                   # run it anywhere without perl binaries

       With the "--par-options" flag, generated binaries can act as "parl" to
       pack new binaries:

           % ./myapp --par-options -Omyap2 myapp.par   # identical to ./myapp
           % ./myapp --par-options -Omyap3 myap3.par   # now with different PAR

   Stand-alone executable format
       The format for the stand-alone executable is simply concatenating the
       following elements:

       o   The executable itself

           Either in plain-text (par.pl) or native executable format (parl or
           parl.exe).

       o   Any number of embedded files

           These are typically used for bootstrapping PAR's various XS
           dependencies.  Each section contains:

           The magic string ""FILE""
           Length of file name in "pack('N')" format plus 9
           8 bytes of hex-encoded CRC32 of file content
           A single slash (""/"")
           The file name (without path)
           File length in "pack('N')" format
           The file's content (not compressed)
       o   One PAR file

           This is just a zip file beginning with the magic string
           ""PK\003\004"".

       o   Ending section

           The pre-computed cache name.  A pack('Z40') string of the value of
           -T (--tempcache) or the hash of the file, followed by "\0CACHE".
           The hash of the file is calculated with Digest::SHA, Digest::SHA1,
           or Digest::MD5.  If none of those modules is available, the "mtime"
           of the file is used.

           A pack('N') number of the total length of FILE and PAR sections,
           followed by a 8-bytes magic string: ""\012PAR.pm\012"".
