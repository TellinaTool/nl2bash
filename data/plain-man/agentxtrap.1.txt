AGENTXTRAP(1)                      Net-SNMP                      AGENTXTRAP(1)



NAME
       agentxtrap - send an AgentX NotifyPDU to an AgentX master agent

SYNOPSIS
       agentxtrap [OPTIONS] trap-oid [OID TYPE VALUE...]

DESCRIPTION
       agentxtrap  issues  an  AgentX NotifyPDU to a master agent. One or more
       object identifiers (OIDs) can be given  as  arguments  on  the  command
       line.   A type and a value must accompany each object identifier.  Each
       variable name is given in the format specified in variables(5).


OPTIONS
       -c contextName
             if the -c option is present then the notification is sent in  the
             nondefault name context.
       -U uptime
             if  the -U option is present then that value, parsed as centisec-
             onds, is taken to be the sysUpTime field of the application.
       -x ADDRESS
             if the -x option is present then contact  the  AgentX  master  at
             ADDRESS and not the default one.

       Additionally  all  the  options  described  in snmpcmd(1) under the MIB
       PARSING OPTIONS, LOGGING OPTIONS and INPUT OPTIONS headers as  well  as
       the -d, -D, -m and -M options are supported.

       In  OID  TYPE VALUE the parsing of the VALUE field is controlled by the
       TYPE field. The possible values for the TYPE field is one of  the  fol-
       lowing characters:
              =  Let OID decide how VALUE should be interpreted
              i  INTEGER
              u  Unsigned
              c  Counter32
              s  OCTET STRING of chaacters
              x  OCTET STRING, entered as a sequence of optionally space sepa-
                 rated hexadecimal digit pairs
              d  OCTET STRING, entered as a sequence of space separated  deci-
                 mal digits in the range 0 - 255
              n  NULL
              o  OBJECT IDENTIFIER
              t  TimeTicks
              a  IpAddress
              b  BITS
       which are handled in the same way as the snmpset command.


EXAMPLES
       To  send  a generic linkUp trap to the manager for interface 1 the fol-
       lowing command can be used:

       agentxtrap netSnmp.0.3 ifindex.1 i 1
