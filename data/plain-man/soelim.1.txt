NAME
       soelim - interpret .so requests in groff input

SYNOPSIS
       soelim [ -Crtv ] [ -Idir ] [ files... ]

       It  is  possible  to have whitespace between the -I command line option
       and its parameter.

DESCRIPTION
       soelim reads files and replaces lines of the form

              .so file

       by the contents of file.  It is useful if files included with  so  need
       to  be  preprocessed.   Normally,  soelim should be invoked with the -s
       option of groff.

       Note that there must be no whitespace between the leading dot  and  the
       two  characters  `s' and `o'.  Otherwise, only groff interprets the .so
       request (and soelim ignores it).

OPTIONS
       -C     Recognize .so even when followed by a character other than space
              or newline.

       -Idir  This  option  may  be  used to specify a directory to search for
              files (both those on the command line and  those  named  in  .so
              requests).   The  current  directory  is  always searched first.
              This option may be specified more  than  once,  the  directories
              will be searched in the order specified.  No directory search is
              performed for files specified using an absolute path.

       -r     Do not add .lf requests (for general use, with non-groff files).

       -t     Don't  emit  .lf  requests  but TeX comment lines (starting with
              `%') giving the current file and line number.

       -v     Print the version number.

USAGE
       The normal processing sequence of groff is this:

                 input        sourced
                 file          file
                   |             |
                   v             v
               preprocessor -> troff -> postprocessor
                                             |
                                             v
                                          output
                                           file

       That is, files sourced with .so are normally read only  by  troff  (the
       actual formatter).  soelim is not required for troff to source files.

       If a file to be sourced should also be preprocessed, it must already be
       read before the input file passes through the  preprocessor.   This  is
       handled by soelim:

                 input
                 file
                   |
                   v
                 soelim -> preprocessor -> troff -> postprocessor
                   ^                                     |
                   |                                     v
                sourced                               output
                 file                                  file
