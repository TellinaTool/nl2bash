DESCRIPTION
     mcxquery is a utility to determine the effective managed preferences for
     a user logging in to a workgroup from a specific computer.

     -user      Specify the short name of the user record to read managed
                preferences from. If this parameter is omitted, or a value of
                "=" specified, the short name of the currently logged in con-
                sole user will be used.

     -group     Specify the short name of the group record to read managed
                preferences from. A value of "=" may be specified to mean the
                name of the workgroup (if any) chosen for the current login
                session.

     -computer  Specify the computer record to read managed preferences from.
                The computer can be specified using either an Ethernet MAC
                address (e.g. "11:22:33:44:55:66"), a Hardware UUID (e.g.
                "00112233-4455-6677-8899-AABBCCDDEEFF") or the short name of
                the computer record itself (e.g. "lab1_12"). If this parameter
                is omitted, or a value of "=" specified, the record for the
                current computer will be used.

EXAMPLES
     mcxquery -user jane -group science -computer lab1_12
              Displays the managed preferences that would be in effect if user
              "jane" logged in using workgroup "science" from the computer
              specified in the "lab1_12" computer record.

     mcxquery -user jane -group science -computer 11:22:33:44:55:66
              Displays the managed preferences that would be in effect if user
              "jane" logged in using workgroup "science" from a computer with
              an Ethernet MAC address of 11:22:33:44:55:66.

     mcxquery -user = -group = -computer guest
              Displays the managed preferences that would be in effect if the
              current user logged in using the current workgroup into a com-
              puter not specified by any computer record (i.e. a "guest" com-
              puter).

     mcxquery -user jane -group math
              Displays the managed preferences that would be in effect if the
              user "jane" logged into the "math" workgroup on the current com-
              puter.

     mcxquery -o /tmp/report.txt -format xml -user jane
              Writes the managed preferences that would be in effect if user
              "jane" logged into the current computer without a workgroup.
              The report is written in XML format to /tmp/report.txt.

     mcxquery -computerOnly -computer lab1_12
              Displays the managed preferences for the computer specified in
              the "lab1_12" computer record only. Useful for determining man-
              aged settings when computer is at login window.

     mcxquery -computerOnly -computer 00112233-4455-6677-8899-AABBCCDDEEFF
              Displays the managed preferences for the computer with the Hard-
              ware UUID "00112233-4455-6677-8899-AABBCCDDEEFF". Supported on
              Mac OS X 10.6 and later.

     mcxquery -forApple -o results.plist
              Creates a plist, suitable for submitting along with bug reports
              to Apple, containing the managed preferences for the current
              user on the current computer. Also includes relevant records
              from Directory Services. Supported on Mac OS X 10.7 and later.
