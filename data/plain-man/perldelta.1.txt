NAME
       perldelta - what is new for perl v5.18.2

DESCRIPTION
       This document describes differences between the 5.18.1 release and the
       5.18.2 release.

       If you are upgrading from an earlier release such as 5.18.0, first read
       perl5181delta, which describes differences between 5.18.0 and 5.18.1.

Modules and Pragmata
   Updated Modules and Pragmata
       o   B has been upgraded from version 1.42_01 to 1.42_02.

           The fix for [perl #118525] introduced a regression in the behaviour
           of "B::CV::GV", changing the return value from a "B::SPECIAL"
           object on a "NULL" "CvGV" to "undef".  "B::CV::GV" again returns a
           "B::SPECIAL" object in this case.  [perl #119413]

       o   B::Concise has been upgraded from version 0.95 to 0.95_01.

           This fixes a bug in dumping unexpected SEPCIALs.

       o   English has been upgraded from version 1.06 to 1.06_01.  This fixes
           an error about the performance of "$`", $&, and c<$'>.

       o   File::Glob has been upgraded from version 1.20 to 1.20_01.

Documentation
   Changes to Existing Documentation
       o   perlrepository has been restored with a pointer to more useful
           pages.

       o   perlhack has been updated with the latest changes from blead.

Selected Bug Fixes
       o   Perl 5.18.1 introduced a regression along with a bugfix for lexical
           subs.  Some B::SPECIAL results from B::CV::GV became undefs
           instead.  This broke Devel::Cover among other libraries.  This has
           been fixed.  [perl #119351]

       o   Perl 5.18.0 introduced a regression whereby "[:^ascii:]", if used
           in the same character class as other qualifiers, would fail to
           match characters in the Latin-1 block.  This has been fixed.  [perl
           #120799]

       o   Perl 5.18.0 introduced a regression when using ->SUPER::method with
           AUTOLOAD by looking up AUTOLOAD from the current package, rather
           than the current packageXs superclass.  This has been fixed. [perl
           #120694]

       o   Perl 5.18.0 introduced a regression whereby "-bareword" was no
           longer permitted under the "strict" and "integer" pragmata when
           used together.  This has been fixed.  [perl #120288]

       o   Previously PerlIOBase_dup didn't check if pushing the new layer
           succeeded before (optionally) setting the utf8 flag. This could
           cause segfaults-by-nullpointer.  This has been fixed.

       o   A buffer overflow with very long identifiers has been fixed.

       o   A regression from 5.16 in the handling of padranges led to
           assertion failures if a keyword plugin declined to handle the
           second XmyX, but only after creating a padop.

           This affected, at least, Devel::CallParser under threaded builds.

           This has been fixed

       o   The construct "$r=qr/.../; /$r/p" is now handled properly, an issue
           which had been worsened by changes 5.18.0. [perl #118213]

Acknowledgements
       Perl 5.18.2 represents approximately 3 months of development since Perl
       5.18.1 and contains approximately 980 lines of changes across 39 files
       from 4 authors.

       Perl continues to flourish into its third decade thanks to a vibrant
       community of users and developers. The following people are known to
       have contributed the improvements that became Perl 5.18.2:

       Craig A. Berry, David Mitchell, Ricardo Signes, Tony Cook.

       The list above is almost certainly incomplete as it is automatically
       generated from version control history. In particular, it does not
       include the names of the (very much appreciated) contributors who
       reported issues to the Perl bug tracker.

       Many of the changes included in this version originated in the CPAN
       modules included in Perl's core. We're grateful to the entire CPAN
       community for helping Perl to flourish.

       For a more complete list of all of Perl's historical contributors,
       please see the AUTHORS file in the Perl source distribution.

Reporting Bugs
       If you find what you think is a bug, you might check the articles
       recently posted to the comp.lang.perl.misc newsgroup and the perl bug
       database at http://rt.perl.org/perlbug/ .  There may also be
       information at http://www.perl.org/ , the Perl Home Page.

       If you believe you have an unreported bug, please run the perlbug
       program included with your release.  Be sure to trim your bug down to a
       tiny but sufficient test case.  Your bug report, along with the output
       of "perl -V", will be sent off to perlbug@perl.org to be analysed by
       the Perl porting team.

       If the bug you are reporting has security implications, which make it
       inappropriate to send to a publicly archived mailing list, then please
       send it to perl5-security-report@perl.org.  This points to a closed
       subscription unarchived mailing list, which includes all the core
       committers, who will be able to help assess the impact of issues,
       figure out a resolution, and help co-ordinate the release of patches to
       mitigate or fix the problem across all platforms on which Perl is
       supported.  Please only use this address for security issues in the
       Perl core, not for modules independently distributed on CPAN.
