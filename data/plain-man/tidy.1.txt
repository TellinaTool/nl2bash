TIDY(1)                                                                TIDY(1)



NAME
       tidy - validate, correct, and pretty-print HTML files

SYNOPSIS
       tidy [option ...] [file ...] [option ...] [file ...]

DESCRIPTION
       Tidy reads HTML, XHTML and XML files and writes cleaned up markup.  For
       HTML varians, it detects and corrects many  common  coding  errors  and
       strives  to  produce  visually  equivalent markup that is both W3C com-
       plaint and works on most browsers.  A common use of Tidy is to  convert
       plain  HTML  to  XHTML.  For generic XML files, Tidy is limited to cor-
       recting basic well-formedness errors and pretty printing.

       If no markup file is specified, Tidy reads the standard input.   If  no
       output  file  is  specified, Tidy writes markup to the standard output.
       If no error file is specified, Tidy writes  messages  to  the  standard
       error.

       tion,  mailing  lists  (with  searchable  archives) and links to report
       bugs.

ENVIRONMENT
       HTML_TIDY      Name of the default configuration file.  This should  be
                      an  absolute  path,  since you will probably invoke tidy
                      from different directories.  The value of HTML_TIDY will
                      be  parsed  after  the compiled-in default (defined with
                      -DCONFIG_FILE), but before any of  the  files  specified
                      using -config.

EXIT STATUS
       0      All input files were processed successfully.

       1      There were warnings.

       2      There were errors.
