NAME
       pwhich - Perl-only `which'

SYNOPSIS
         $ pwhich perl
         $ pwhich -a perl          # print all matches
         $ pwhich perl perldoc ... # look for multiple programs
         $ pwhich -a perl perldoc ...

DESCRIPTION
       `pwhich' is a command-line utility program for finding paths to other
       programs based on the user's "PATH". It is similar to the usualy Unix
       tool `which', and tries to emulate its functionality, but is written
       purely in Perl (uses the module "File::Which"), so is portable.

   Calling syntax
         $ pwhich [-a] [-v] programname [programname ...]

   Options
       -a  The option -a will make "pwhich" print all matches found in the
           "PATH" variable instead of just the first one. Each match is
           printed on a separate line.

       -v  Prints version (of "File::Which") and copyright notice and exits.

       Originated in modperl-2.0/lib/Apache/Build.pm. Changed for use in
       DocSet (for the mod_perl site) and Win32-awareness by me, with slight
       modifications by Stas Bekman, then extracted to create "File::Which".

       Version 0.04 had some significant platform-related changes, taken from
       the Perl Power Tools `which' implementation by Abigail with
       enhancements from Peter Prymmer. See
       <http://www.perl.com/language/ppt/src/which/index.html> for more
       information.
