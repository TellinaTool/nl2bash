java_home(1)                                                      java_home(1)



NAME
       java_home - return a value for $JAVA_HOME


SYNOPSIS
       /usr/libexec/java_home [options]


DESCRIPTION
       The java_home command returns a path suitable for setting the JAVA_HOME
       environment variable.  It determines this path from the user's  enabled
       and  preferred  JVMs  in  the Java Preferences application.  Additional
       constraints may be provided to filter the list of JVMs  available.   By
       default,  if  no  constraints  match  the  available  list of JVMs, the
       default order is used.  The path is printed to standard output.


OPTIONS
       -v or --version  version
              Filters the returned JVMs  by  the  major  platform  version  in
              "JVMVersion" form. Example versions: "1.5+", or "1.6*".


       -a or --arch  architecture
              Filters  the  returned  JVMs  by  the architecture they support.
              Example architectures: "i386", "x86_64", or "ppc".


       -d or --datamodel  datamodel
              Filters the returned JVMs capable of running  in  32  or  64-bit
              mode.  Supported  datamodels:  "-d32"  and  "-d64". Specifying a
              datamodel is synonymous with specifying a  particular  architec-
              ture.


       -t or --task  task
              Selects from the list of JVMs which can run a specific task. The
              order of each of these lists is  set  by  the  Java  Preferences
              application.   Supported  tasks:  "Applets",  "WebStart",  "Bun-
              dledApp", "JNI" and "CommandLine". The default task is "Command-
              Line".


       -F or --failfast
              Immediately  fails  when  filters return no JVMs; does not print
              out the path to the default $JAVA_HOME.


       --exec  command ...
              Executes the command at $JAVA_HOME/bin/<command> and passes  the
              remaining arguments. Any arguments to select which $JAVA_HOME to
              use must precede the --exec option.


       -X or --xml
              Prints the list of selected JVMs and associated properties as an
              XML plist to stdout.


       -V or --verbose
              Prints the matching list of JVMs and architectures to stderr.


       -h or --help
              Brief usage information.


USAGE
       /usr/libexec/java_home  helps  users set a $JAVA_HOME in their login rc
       files, or provides a way for command-line Java tools to  use  the  most
       appropriate  JVM  which  can  satisfy a minimum version or architecture
       requirement. The --exec argument  can  invoke  tools  in  the  selected
       $JAVA_HOME/bin  directory,  which  is useful for starting Java command-
       line tools from launchd plists without hardcoding the full path to  the
       Java command-line tool.


       Usage for bash-style shells:
              $ export JAVA_HOME=`/usr/libexec/java_home`

       Usage for csh-style shells:
              % setenv JAVA_HOME `/usr/libexec/java_home`
