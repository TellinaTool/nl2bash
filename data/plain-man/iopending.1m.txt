NAME
       iopending - plot number of pending disk events. Uses DTrace.

SYNOPSIS
       iopending  [-c]  [-d  device]  [-f filename] [-m mount_point] [interval
       [count]]

DESCRIPTION
       This samples the number of disk events that are  pending  and  plots  a
       distribution graph. By doing this the "serialness" or "parallelness" of
       disk behaviour can be distinguished.  A high  occurance  of  a  pending
       value of more than 1 is an indication of saturation.

       Since  this  uses  DTrace, only users with root privileges can run this
       command.

OPTIONS
       -c     clear screen

       -d device
              instance name to snoop (eg, dad0)

       -f filename
              full pathname of file to snoop

       -m mount_point
              mountpoint for filesystem to snoop

EXAMPLES
       Default output, print I/O summary every 1 second,
              # iopending


       Print 10 second samples,
              # iopending 10


       Print 12 x 5 second samples,
              # iopending 5 12


       Snoop events on the root filesystem only,
              # iopending -m /


FIELDS
       value  number of pending events, 0 == idle

       count  number of samples @ 1000 Hz

       load   1 min load average

       disk_r total disk read Kb for sample

       disk_w total disk write Kb for sample
