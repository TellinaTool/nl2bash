NAME
       perl5141delta - what is new for perl v5.14.1

DESCRIPTION
       This document describes differences between the 5.14.0 release and the
       5.14.1 release.

       If you are upgrading from an earlier release such as 5.12.0, first read
       perl5140delta, which describes differences between 5.12.0 and 5.14.0.

Core Enhancements
       No changes since 5.14.0.

Security
       No changes since 5.14.0.

Incompatible Changes
       There are no changes intentionally incompatible with 5.14.0. If any
       exist, they are bugs and reports are welcome.

Deprecations
       There have been no deprecations since 5.14.0.

Modules and Pragmata
   New Modules and Pragmata
       None

   Updated Modules and Pragmata
       o   B::Deparse has been upgraded from version 1.03 to 1.04, to address
           two regressions in Perl 5.14.0:

           Deparsing of the "glob" operator and its diamond ("<>") form now
           works again. [perl #90898]

           The presence of subroutines named "::::" or "::::::" no longer
           causes B::Deparse to hang.

       o   Pod::Perldoc has been upgraded from version 3.15_03 to 3.15_04.

           It corrects the search paths on VMS. [perl #90640]

   Removed Modules and Pragmata
       None

Documentation
   New Documentation
       None

   Changes to Existing Documentation
       perlfunc

       o   "given", "when" and "default" are now listed in perlfunc.

       o   Documentation for "use" now includes a pointer to if.pm.

       perllol

       o   perllol has been expanded with examples using the new "push
           $scalar" syntax introduced in Perl 5.14.0.

       perlop

       o   The explanation of bitwise operators has been expanded to explain
           how they work on Unicode strings.

       o   The section on the triple-dot or yada-yada operator has been moved
           up, as it used to separate two closely related sections about the
           comma operator.

       o   More examples for "m//g" have been added.

       o   The "<<\FOO" here-doc syntax has been documented.

       perlrun

       o   perlrun has undergone a significant clean-up.  Most notably, the
           -0x... form of the -0 flag has been clarified, and the final
           section on environment variables has been corrected and expanded.

       POSIX

       o   The invocation documentation for "WIFEXITED", "WEXITSTATUS",
           "WIFSIGNALED", "WTERMSIG", "WIFSTOPPED", and "WSTOPSIG" was
           corrected.

Diagnostics
       The following additions or changes have been made to diagnostic output,
       including warnings and fatal error messages.  For the complete list of
       diagnostic messages, see perldiag.

   New Diagnostics
       None

   Changes to Existing Diagnostics
       None

Utility Changes
       None

Configuration and Compilation
       o   regexp.h has been modified for compatibility with GCC's "-Werror"
           option, as used by some projects that include perl's header files.

Testing
       o   Some test failures in dist/Locale-Maketext/t/09_compile.t that
           could occur depending on the environment have been fixed. [perl
           #89896]

       o   A watchdog timer for t/re/re.t was lengthened to accommodate SH-4
           systems which were unable to complete the tests before the previous
           timer ran out.

Platform Support
   New Platforms
       None

   Discontinued Platforms
       None

   Platform-Specific Notes
       Solaris

       o   Documentation listing the Solaris packages required to build Perl
           on Solaris 9 and Solaris 10 has been corrected.

       Mac OS X

       o   The lib/locale.t test script has been updated to work on the
           upcoming Lion release.

       o   Mac OS X specific compilation instructions have been clarified.

       Ubuntu Linux

       o   The ODBM_File installation process has been updated with the new
           library paths on Ubuntu natty.

Internal Changes
       o   The compiled representation of formats is now stored via the mg_ptr
           of their PERL_MAGIC_fm. Previously it was stored in the string
           buffer, beyond SvLEN(), the regular end of the string. SvCOMPILED()
           and SvCOMPILED_{on,off}() now exist solely for compatibility for XS
           code.  The first is always 0, the other two now no-ops.

Bug Fixes
       o   A bug has been fixed that would cause a "Use of freed value in
           iteration" error if the next two hash elements that would be
           iterated over are deleted. [perl #85026]

       o   Passing the same constant subroutine to both "index" and "formline"
           no longer causes one or the other to fail. [perl #89218]

       o   5.14.0 introduced some memory leaks in regular expression character
           classes such as "[\w\s]", which have now been fixed.

       o   An edge case in regular expression matching could potentially loop.
           This happened only under "/i" in bracketed character classes that
           have characters with multi-character folds, and the target string
           to match against includes the first portion of the fold, followed
           by another character that has a multi-character fold that begins
           with the remaining portion of the fold, plus some more.

            "s\N{U+DF}" =~ /[\x{DF}foo]/i

           is one such case.  "\xDF" folds to "ss".

       o   Several Unicode case-folding bugs have been fixed.

       o   The new (in 5.14.0) regular expression modifier "/a" when repeated
           like "/aa" forbids the characters outside the ASCII range that
           match characters inside that range from matching under "/i".  This
           did not work under some circumstances, all involving alternation,
           such as:

            "\N{KELVIN SIGN}" =~ /k|foo/iaa;

           succeeded inappropriately.  This is now fixed.

       o   Fixed a case where it was possible that a freed buffer may have
           been read from when parsing a here document.

Acknowledgements
       Perl 5.14.1 represents approximately four weeks of development since
       Perl 5.14.0 and contains approximately 3500 lines of changes across 38
       files from 17 authors.

       Perl continues to flourish into its third decade thanks to a vibrant
       community of users and developers.  The following people are known to
       have contributed the improvements that became Perl 5.14.1:

       Bo Lindbergh, Claudio Ramirez, Craig A. Berry, David Leadbeater, Father
       Chrysostomos, Jesse Vincent, Jim Cromie, Justin Case, Karl Williamson,
       Leo Lapworth, Nicholas Clark, Nobuhiro Iwamatsu, smash, Tom
       Christiansen, Ton Hospel, Vladimir Timofeev, and Zsban Ambrus.

Reporting Bugs
       If you find what you think is a bug, you might check the articles
       recently posted to the comp.lang.perl.misc newsgroup and the perl bug
       database at http://rt.perl.org/perlbug/ .  There may also be
       information at http://www.perl.org/ , the Perl Home Page.

       If you believe you have an unreported bug, please run the perlbug
       program included with your release.  Be sure to trim your bug down to a
       tiny but sufficient test case.  Your bug report, along with the output
       of "perl -V", will be sent off to perlbug@perl.org to be analysed by
       the Perl porting team.

       If the bug you are reporting has security implications, which make it
       inappropriate to send to a publicly archived mailing list, then please
       send it to perl5-security-report@perl.org. This points to a closed
       subscription unarchived mailing list, which includes all the core
       committers, who be able to help assess the impact of issues, figure out
       a resolution, and help co-ordinate the release of patches to mitigate
       or fix the problem across all platforms on which Perl is supported.
       Please only use this address for security issues in the Perl core, not
       for modules independently distributed on CPAN.
