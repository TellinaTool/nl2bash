NAME
       syscallbysysc.d - syscalls by syscall. Uses DTrace.

SYNOPSIS
       syscallbysysc.d

DESCRIPTION
       syscallbysysc.d  is a DTrace OneLiner to a report of the number of each
       type of system call made.

       This is useful to identify which system call is the most common.

       Docs/oneliners.txt  and  Docs/Examples/oneliners_examples.txt  in   the
       DTraceToolkit  contain  this  as  a oneliner that can be cut-n-paste to
       run.

       Since this uses DTrace, only users with root privileges  can  run  this
       command.

EXAMPLES
       This samples until Ctrl-C is hit.
              # syscallbysysc.d


FIELDS
       first field
              This  is the system call type. Most have man pages in section 2.

       second field
              This is the count, the number of  occurrances  for  this  system
              call.


DOCUMENTATION
       See  the  DTraceToolkit for further documentation under the Docs direc-
       tory. The DTraceToolkit docs may include full worked examples with ver-
       bose descriptions explaining the output.

EXIT
       syscallbysysc.d will sample until Ctrl-C is hit.
