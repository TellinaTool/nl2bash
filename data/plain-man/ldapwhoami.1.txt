NAME
       ldapwhoami - LDAP who am i? tool

SYNOPSIS
       ldapwhoami  [-n] [-v] [-z] [-d debuglevel] [-D binddn] [-W] [-w passwd]
       [-y passwdfile]      [-H ldapuri]      [-h ldaphost]      [-p ldapport]
       [-e [!]ext[=extparam]]  [-E [!]ext[=extparam]] [-O security-properties]
       [-I] [-Q] [-U authcid] [-R realm] [-x] [-X authzid] [-Y mech] [-Z[Z]]

DESCRIPTION
       ldapwhoami implements the LDAP "Who Am I?" extended operation.

       ldapwhoami opens a connection to an LDAP server, binds, and performs  a
       whoami operation.

OPTIONS
       -n     Show  what  would be done, but don't actually perform the whoami
              operation.  Useful for debugging in conjunction with -v.

       -v     Run in verbose mode, with many diagnostics written  to  standard
              output.

       -d debuglevel
              Set  the LDAP debugging level to debuglevel.  ldapwhoami must be
              compiled with LDAP_DEBUG defined for this  option  to  have  any
              effect.

       -x     Use simple authentication instead of SASL.

       -D binddn
              Use the Distinguished Name binddn to bind to the LDAP directory.
              For SASL binds, the server is expected to ignore this value.

       -W     Prompt for simple authentication.  This is used instead of spec-
              ifying the password on the command line.

       -w passwd
              Use passwd as the password for simple authentication.

       -y passwdfile
              Use  complete  contents of passwdfile as the password for simple
              authentication.

       -H ldapuri
              Specify URI(s) referring to the ldap server(s); only the  proto-
              col/host/port  fields  are  allowed; a list of URI, separated by
              whitespace or commas is expected.

       -h ldaphost
              Specify an alternate host on which the ldap server  is  running.
              Deprecated in favor of -H.

       -p ldapport
              Specify  an  alternate TCP port where the ldap server is listen-
              ing.  Deprecated in favor of -H.

       -O security-properties
              Specify SASL security properties.

       -e [!]ext[=extparam]

       -E [!]ext[=extparam]

              Specify general extensions with -e and  search  extensions  with
              -E.  '!' indicates criticality.

              General extensions:
                [!]assert=<filter>   (an RFC 4515 Filter)
                [!]authzid=<authzid> ("dn:<dn>" or "u:<user>")
                [!]manageDSAit
                [!]noop
                ppolicy
                [!]postread[=<attrs>]        (a comma-separated attribute list)
                [!]preread[=<attrs>] (a comma-separated attribute list)
                abandon, cancel (SIGINT sends abandon/cancel; not really controls)

              Search extensions:
                [!]domainScope                               (domain scope)
                [!]mv=<filter>                               (matched values filter)
                [!]pr=<size>[/prompt|noprompt]       (paged results/prompt)
                [!]sss=[-]<attr[:OID]>[/[-]<attr[:OID]>...]  (server side sorting)
                [!]subentries[=true|false]           (subentries)
                [!]sync=ro[/<cookie>]                        (LDAP Sync refreshOnly)
                        rp[/<cookie>][/<slimit>]     (LDAP Sync refreshAndPersist)

       -I     Enable  SASL  Interactive  mode.   Always prompt.  Default is to
              prompt only as needed.

       -Q     Enable SASL Quiet mode.  Never prompt.

       -U authcid
              Specify the authentication ID for SASL bind. The form of the  ID
              depends on the actual SASL mechanism used.

       -R realm
              Specify  the  realm of authentication ID for SASL bind. The form
              of the realm depends on the actual SASL mechanism used.

       -X authzid
              Specify the requested authorization ID for SASL  bind.   authzid
              must be one of the following formats: dn:<distinguished name> or
              u:<username>

       -Y mech
              Specify the SASL mechanism to be  used  for  authentication.  If
              it's  not  specified, the program will choose the best mechanism
              the server knows.

       -Z[Z]  Issue StartTLS (Transport Layer Security) extended operation. If
              you  use  -ZZ, the command will require the operation to be suc-
              cessful.

EXAMPLE
           ldapwhoami -x -D "cn=Manager,dc=example,dc=com" -W
