NAME
       afmtodit - create font files for use with groff -Tps

SYNOPSIS
       afmtodit [ -mnsvx ] [ -a n ] [ -d desc_file ] [ -e enc_file ] [ -i n ]
                afm_file map_file font

       The whitespace between an command  line  option  and  its  argument  is
       optional.

DESCRIPTION
       afmtodit creates a font file for use with groff and grops.  afmtodit is
       written in perl; you must have perl version 5.004 or newer installed in
       order to run afmtodit.

       afm_file is the AFM (Adobe Font Metric) file for the font.

       map_file  is a file that says which groff character names map onto each
       PostScript character name; this file should contain a sequence of lines
       of the form

              ps_char groff_char

       where ps_char is the PostScript name of the character and groff_char is
       the groff name of the character (as used in the groff font file).   The
       same ps_char can occur multiple times in the file; each groff_char must
       occur at most once.  Lines starting with # and blank lines are ignored.
       If the file isn't found in the current directory, it is searched in the
       `devps/generate' subdirectory of the default font directory.

       If a PostScript character is not named as uniXXXX (XXXX are four upper-
       case  hexadecimal  digits),  and  is  not  mentioned in map_file, and a
       generic groff glyph name can't be deduced using the  Adobe  Glyph  List
       (AGL, built into afmtodit), then afmtodit puts the PostScript character
       into the groff font file as an unnamed  character  which  can  only  be
       accessed by the \N escape sequence in troff.  If option -e is not spec-
       ified, the encoding defined in the AFM file (i.e.,  entries  with  non-
       negative character codes) is used.  Please refer to section `Using Sym-
       bols' in the groff info file which describes how groff glyph names  are
       constructed.

       Characters  not encoded in the AFM file (i.e., entries which have -1 as
       the character code) are still available in groff; they get glyph  index
       values  greater  than  255  (or greater than the biggest character code
       used in the AFM file in the unlikely case that it is greater than  255)
       in  the  groff  font file.  Glyph indices of unencoded characters don't
       have a specific order; it is best to access them with glyph names only.

       The groff font file will be output to a file called font.

       If  there is a downloadable font file for the font, it may be listed in
       the file /usr/share/groff/1.19.2/font/devps/download; see grops(1).

       If the -i option is  used,  afmtodit  will  automatically  generate  an
       italic  correction, a left italic correction and a subscript correction
       for each character (the significance of these parameters  is  explained
       in  groff_font(5));  these  parameters  may be specified for individual
       characters by adding to the afm_file lines of the form:

              italicCorrection ps_char n
              leftItalicCorrection ps_char n
              subscriptCorrection ps_char n

       where ps_char is the PostScript name of the character,  and  n  is  the
       desired  value  of the corresponding parameter in thousandths of an em.
       These parameters are normally  needed  only  for  italic  (or  oblique)
       fonts.

OPTIONS
       -an    Use  n  as the slant parameter in the font file; this is used by
              groff in the positioning of accents.  By default  afmtodit  uses
              the  negative of the ItalicAngle specified in the afm file; with
              true italic fonts it is sometimes desirable to use a slant  that
              is  less  than this.  If you find that characters from an italic
              font have accents placed too far to the right  over  them,  then
              use the -a option to give the font a smaller slant.

       -ddesc_file
              The device description file is desc_file rather than the default
              DESC.  If not found in the current directory, the `devps' subdi-
              rectory  of the default font directory is searched (this is true
              for both the default device description file and  a  file  given
              with option -d).

       -eenc_file
              The  PostScript  font  should  be  reencoded to use the encoding
              described in enc_file.  The format of enc_file is  described  in
              grops(1).   If  not  found in the current directory, the `devps'
              subdirectory of the default font directory is searched.

       -in    Generate an italic correction for each  character  so  that  the
              character's  width  plus  the  character's  italic correction is
              equal to n thousandths of an em plus the  amount  by  which  the
              right  edge  of  the character's bounding box is to the right of
              the character's origin.  If this  would  result  in  a  negative
              italic correction, use a zero italic correction instead.

              Also generate a subscript correction equal to the product of the
              tangent of the slant of the font and four fifths of the x-height
              of  the  font.   If  this would result in a subscript correction
              greater than the italic correction, use a  subscript  correction
              equal to the italic correction instead.

              Also  generate a left italic correction for each character equal
              to n thousandths of an em plus the amount by which the left edge
              of  the  character's  bounding box is to the left of the charac-
              ter's origin.  The left italic correction may be negative unless
              option -m is given.

              This  option  is  normally  needed only with italic (or oblique)
              fonts.  The font files distributed with groff were created using
              an option of -i50 for italic fonts.

       -m     Prevent  negative  left  italic  correction  values.  Roman font
              files distributed with groff were created with -i0 -m to improve
              spacing with eqn(1).

       -n     Don't  output  a ligatures command for this font.  Use this with
              constant-width fonts.

       -s     The font is special.  The effect of this option is  to  add  the
              special command to the font file.

       -v     Print version.

       -x     Don't use the built-in Adobe Glyph List.
