NAME
       perl5160delta - what is new for perl v5.16.0

DESCRIPTION
       This document describes differences between the 5.14.0 release and the
       5.16.0 release.

       If you are upgrading from an earlier release such as 5.12.0, first read
       perl5140delta, which describes differences between 5.12.0 and 5.14.0.

       Some bug fixes in this release have been backported to later releases
       of 5.14.x.  Those are indicated with the 5.14.x version in parentheses.

Notice
       With the release of Perl 5.16.0, the 5.12.x series of releases is now
       out of its support period.  There may be future 5.12.x releases, but
       only in the event of a critical security issue.  Users of Perl 5.12 or
       earlier should consider upgrading to a more recent release of Perl.

       This policy is described in greater detail in perlpolicy.

Core Enhancements
   "use VERSION"
       As of this release, version declarations like "use v5.16" now disable
       all features before enabling the new feature bundle.  This means that
       the following holds true:

           use 5.016;
           # only 5.16 features enabled here
           use 5.014;
           # only 5.14 features enabled here (not 5.16)

       "use v5.12" and higher continue to enable strict, but explicit "use
       strict" and "no strict" now override the version declaration, even when
       they come first:

           no strict;
           use 5.012;
           # no strict here

       There is a new ":default" feature bundle that represents the set of
       features enabled before any version declaration or "use feature" has
       been seen.  Version declarations below 5.10 now enable the ":default"
       feature set.  This does not actually change the behavior of "use v5.8",
       because features added to the ":default" set are those that were
       traditionally enabled by default, before they could be turned off.

       "no feature" now resets to the default feature set.  To disable all
       features (which is likely to be a pretty special-purpose request, since
       it presumably won't match any named set of semantics) you can now write
       "no feature ':all'".

       $[ is now disabled under "use v5.16".  It is part of the default
       feature set and can be turned on or off explicitly with "use feature
       'array_base'".

   "__SUB__"
       The new "__SUB__" token, available under the "current_sub" feature (see
       feature) or "use v5.16", returns a reference to the current subroutine,
       making it easier to write recursive closures.

   New and Improved Built-ins
       More consistent "eval"

       The "eval" operator sometimes treats a string argument as a sequence of
       characters and sometimes as a sequence of bytes, depending on the
       internal encoding.  The internal encoding is not supposed to make any
       difference, but there is code that relies on this inconsistency.

       The new "unicode_eval" and "evalbytes" features (enabled under "use
       5.16.0") resolve this.  The "unicode_eval" feature causes "eval
       $string" to treat the string always as Unicode.  The "evalbytes"
       features provides a function, itself called "evalbytes", which
       evaluates its argument always as a string of bytes.

       These features also fix oddities with source filters leaking to outer
       dynamic scopes.

       See feature for more detail.

       "substr" lvalue revamp

       When "substr" is called in lvalue or potential lvalue context with two
       or three arguments, a special lvalue scalar is returned that modifies
       the original string (the first argument) when assigned to.

       Previously, the offsets (the second and third arguments) passed to
       "substr" would be converted immediately to match the string, negative
       offsets being translated to positive and offsets beyond the end of the
       string being truncated.

       Now, the offsets are recorded without modification in the special
       lvalue scalar that is returned, and the original string is not even
       looked at by "substr" itself, but only when the returned lvalue is read
       or modified.

       These changes result in an incompatible change:

       If the original string changes length after the call to "substr" but
       before assignment to its return value, negative offsets will remember
       their position from the end of the string, affecting code like this:

           my $string = "string";
           my $lvalue = \substr $string, -4, 2;
           print $$lvalue, "\n"; # prints "ri"
           $string = "bailing twine";
           print $$lvalue, "\n"; # prints "wi"; used to print "il"

       The same thing happens with an omitted third argument.  The returned
       lvalue will always extend to the end of the string, even if the string
       becomes longer.

       Since this change also allowed many bugs to be fixed (see "The "substr"
       operator"), and since the behavior of negative offsets has never been
       specified, the change was deemed acceptable.

       Return value of "tied"

       The value returned by "tied" on a tied variable is now the actual
       scalar that holds the object to which the variable is tied.  This lets
       ties be weakened with "Scalar::Util::weaken(tied $tied_variable)".

   Unicode Support
       Supports (almost) Unicode 6.1

       Besides the addition of whole new scripts, and new characters in
       existing scripts, this new version of Unicode, as always, makes some
       changes to existing characters.  One change that may trip up some
       applications is that the General Category of two characters in the
       Latin-1 range, PILCROW SIGN and SECTION SIGN, has been changed from
       Other_Symbol to Other_Punctuation.  The same change has been made for a
       character in each of Tibetan, Ethiopic, and Aegean.  The code points
       U+3248..U+324F (CIRCLED NUMBER TEN ON BLACK SQUARE through CIRCLED
       NUMBER EIGHTY ON BLACK SQUARE) have had their General Category changed
       from Other_Symbol to Other_Numeric.  The Line Break property has
       changes for Hebrew and Japanese; and because of other changes in 6.1,
       the Perl regular expression construct "\X" now works differently for
       some characters in Thai and Lao.

       New aliases (synonyms) have been defined for many property values;
       these, along with the previously existing ones, are all cross-indexed
       in perluniprops.

       The return value of "charnames::viacode()" is affected by other
       changes:

        Code point      Old Name             New Name
          U+000A    LINE FEED (LF)        LINE FEED
          U+000C    FORM FEED (FF)        FORM FEED
          U+000D    CARRIAGE RETURN (CR)  CARRIAGE RETURN
          U+0085    NEXT LINE (NEL)       NEXT LINE
          U+008E    SINGLE-SHIFT 2        SINGLE-SHIFT-2
          U+008F    SINGLE-SHIFT 3        SINGLE-SHIFT-3
          U+0091    PRIVATE USE 1         PRIVATE USE-1
          U+0092    PRIVATE USE 2         PRIVATE USE-2
          U+2118    SCRIPT CAPITAL P      WEIERSTRASS ELLIPTIC FUNCTION

       Perl will accept any of these names as input, but
       "charnames::viacode()" now returns the new name of each pair.  The
       change for U+2118 is considered by Unicode to be a correction, that is
       the original name was a mistake (but again, it will remain forever
       valid to use it to refer to U+2118).  But most of these changes are the
       fallout of the mistake Unicode 6.0 made in naming a character used in
       Japanese cell phones to be "BELL", which conflicts with the
       longstanding industry use of (and Unicode's recommendation to use) that
       name to mean the ASCII control character at U+0007.  Therefore, that
       name has been deprecated in Perl since v5.14, and any use of it will
       raise a warning message (unless turned off).  The name "ALERT" is now
       the preferred name for this code point, with "BEL" an acceptable short
       form.  The name for the new cell phone character, at code point
       U+1F514, remains undefined in this version of Perl (hence we don't
       implement quite all of Unicode 6.1), but starting in v5.18, BELL will
       mean this character, and not U+0007.

       Unicode has taken steps to make sure that this sort of mistake does not
       happen again.  The Standard now includes all generally accepted names
       and abbreviations for control characters, whereas previously it didn't
       (though there were recommended names for most of them, which Perl
       used).  This means that most of those recommended names are now
       officially in the Standard.  Unicode did not recommend names for the
       four code points listed above between U+008E and U+008F, and in
       standardizing them Unicode subtly changed the names that Perl had
       previously given them, by replacing the final blank in each name by a
       hyphen.  Unicode also officially accepts names that Perl had
       deprecated, such as FILE SEPARATOR.  Now the only deprecated name is
       BELL.  Finally, Perl now uses the new official names instead of the old
       (now considered obsolete) names for the first four code points in the
       list above (the ones which have the parentheses in them).

       Now that the names have been placed in the Unicode standard, these
       kinds of changes should not happen again, though corrections, such as
       to U+2118, are still possible.

       Unicode also added some name abbreviations, which Perl now accepts: SP
       for SPACE; TAB for CHARACTER TABULATION; NEW LINE, END OF LINE, NL, and
       EOL for LINE FEED; LOCKING-SHIFT ONE for SHIFT OUT; LOCKING-SHIFT ZERO
       for SHIFT IN; and ZWNBSP for ZERO WIDTH NO-BREAK SPACE.

       More details on this version of Unicode are provided in
       <http://www.unicode.org/versions/Unicode6.1.0/>.

       "use charnames" is no longer needed for "\N{name}"

       When "\N{name}" is encountered, the "charnames" module is now
       automatically loaded when needed as if the ":full" and ":short" options
       had been specified.  See charnames for more information.

       "\N{...}" can now have Unicode loose name matching

       This is described in the "charnames" item in "Updated Modules and
       Pragmata" below.

       Unicode Symbol Names

       Perl now has proper support for Unicode in symbol names.  It used to be
       that "*{$foo}" would ignore the internal UTF8 flag and use the bytes of
       the underlying representation to look up the symbol.  That meant that
       "*{"\x{100}"}" and "*{"\xc4\x80"}" would return the same thing.  All
       these parts of Perl have been fixed to account for Unicode:

       o   Method names (including those passed to "use overload")

       o   Typeglob names (including names of variables, subroutines, and
           filehandles)

       o   Package names

       o   "goto"

       o   Symbolic dereferencing

       o   Second argument to "bless()" and "tie()"

       o   Return value of "ref()"

       o   Subroutine prototypes

       o   Attributes

       o   Various warnings and error messages that mention variable names or
           values, methods, etc.

       In addition, a parsing bug has been fixed that prevented "*{e}" from
       implicitly quoting the name, but instead interpreted it as "*{+e}",
       which would cause a strict violation.

       "*{"*a::b"}" automatically strips off the * if it is followed by an
       ASCII letter.  That has been extended to all Unicode identifier
       characters.

       One-character non-ASCII non-punctuation variables (like "$e") are now
       subject to "Used only once" warnings.  They used to be exempt, as they
       were treated as punctuation variables.

       Also, single-character Unicode punctuation variables (like $X) are now
       supported [perl #69032].

       Improved ability to mix locales and Unicode, including UTF-8 locales

       An optional parameter has been added to "use locale"

        use locale ':not_characters';

       which tells Perl to use all but the "LC_CTYPE" and "LC_COLLATE"
       portions of the current locale.  Instead, the character set is assumed
       to be Unicode.  This lets locales and Unicode be seamlessly mixed,
       including the increasingly frequent UTF-8 locales.  When using this
       hybrid form of locales, the ":locale" layer to the open pragma can be
       used to interface with the file system, and there are CPAN modules
       available for ARGV and environment variable conversions.

       Full details are in perllocale.

       New function "fc" and corresponding escape sequence "\F" for Unicode
       foldcase

       Unicode foldcase is an extension to lowercase that gives better results
       when comparing two strings case-insensitively.  It has long been used
       internally in regular expression "/i" matching.  Now it is available
       explicitly through the new "fc" function call (enabled by
       "use feature 'fc'", or "use v5.16", or explicitly callable via
       "CORE::fc") or through the new "\F" sequence in double-quotish strings.

       Full details are in "fc" in perlfunc.

       The Unicode "Script_Extensions" property is now supported.

       New in Unicode 6.0, this is an improved "Script" property.  Details are
       in "Scripts" in perlunicode.

   XS Changes
       Improved typemaps for Some Builtin Types

       Most XS authors will know there is a longstanding bug in the OUTPUT
       typemap for T_AVREF ("AV*"), T_HVREF ("HV*"), T_CVREF ("CV*"), and
       T_SVREF ("SVREF" or "\$foo") that requires manually decrementing the
       reference count of the return value instead of the typemap taking care
       of this.  For backwards-compatibility, this cannot be changed in the
       default typemaps.  But we now provide additional typemaps
       "T_AVREF_REFCOUNT_FIXED", etc. that do not exhibit this bug.  Using
       them in your extension is as simple as having one line in your
       "TYPEMAP" section:

         HV*   T_HVREF_REFCOUNT_FIXED

       "is_utf8_char()"

       The XS-callable function "is_utf8_char()", when presented with
       malformed UTF-8 input, can read up to 12 bytes beyond the end of the
       string.  This cannot be fixed without changing its API, and so its use
       is now deprecated.  Use "is_utf8_char_buf()" (described just below)
       instead.

       Added "is_utf8_char_buf()"

       This function is designed to replace the deprecated "is_utf8_char()"
       function.  It includes an extra parameter to make sure it doesn't read
       past the end of the input buffer.

       Other "is_utf8_foo()" functions, as well as "utf8_to_foo()", etc.

       Most other XS-callable functions that take UTF-8 encoded input
       implicitly assume that the UTF-8 is valid (not malformed) with respect
       to buffer length.  Do not do things such as change a character's case
       or see if it is alphanumeric without first being sure that it is valid
       UTF-8.  This can be safely done for a whole string by using one of the
       functions "is_utf8_string()", "is_utf8_string_loc()", and
       "is_utf8_string_loclen()".

       New Pad API

       Many new functions have been added to the API for manipulating lexical
       pads.  See "Pad Data Structures" in perlapi for more information.

   Changes to Special Variables
       $$ can be assigned to

       $$ was made read-only in Perl 5.8.0.  But only sometimes: "local $$"
       would make it writable again.  Some CPAN modules were using "local $$"
       or XS code to bypass the read-only check, so there is no reason to keep
       $$ read-only.  (This change also allowed a bug to be fixed while
       maintaining backward compatibility.)

       $^X converted to an absolute path on FreeBSD, OS X and Solaris

       $^X is now converted to an absolute path on OS X, FreeBSD (without
       needing /proc mounted) and Solaris 10 and 11.  This augments the
       previous approach of using /proc on Linux, FreeBSD, and NetBSD (in all
       cases, where mounted).

       This makes relocatable perl installations more useful on these
       platforms.  (See "Relocatable @INC" in INSTALL)

   Debugger Changes
       Features inside the debugger

       The current Perl's feature bundle is now enabled for commands entered
       in the interactive debugger.

       New option for the debugger's t command

       The t command in the debugger, which toggles tracing mode, now accepts
       a numeric argument that determines how many levels of subroutine calls
       to trace.

       "enable" and "disable"

       The debugger now has "disable" and "enable" commands for disabling
       existing breakpoints and re-enabling them.  See perldebug.

       Breakpoints with file names

       The debugger's "b" command for setting breakpoints now lets a line
       number be prefixed with a file name.  See "b [file]:[line] [condition]"
       in perldebug.

   The "CORE" Namespace
       The "CORE::" prefix

       The "CORE::" prefix can now be used on keywords enabled by feature.pm,
       even outside the scope of "use feature".

       Subroutines in the "CORE" namespace

       Many Perl keywords are now available as subroutines in the CORE
       namespace.  This lets them be aliased:

           BEGIN { *entangle = \&CORE::tie }
           entangle $variable, $package, @args;

       And for prototypes to be bypassed:

           sub mytie(\[%$*@]$@) {
               my ($ref, $pack, @args) = @_;
               ... do something ...
               goto &CORE::tie;
           }

       Some of these cannot be called through references or via &foo syntax,
       but must be called as barewords.

       See CORE for details.

   Other Changes
       Anonymous handles

       Automatically generated file handles are now named __ANONIO__ when the
       variable name cannot be determined, rather than $__ANONIO__.

       Autoloaded sort Subroutines

       Custom sort subroutines can now be autoloaded [perl #30661]:

           sub AUTOLOAD { ... }
           @sorted = sort foo @list; # uses AUTOLOAD

       "continue" no longer requires the "switch" feature

       The "continue" keyword has two meanings.  It can introduce a "continue"
       block after a loop, or it can exit the current "when" block.  Up to
       now, the latter meaning was valid only with the "switch" feature
       enabled, and was a syntax error otherwise.  Since the main purpose of
       feature.pm is to avoid conflicts with user-defined subroutines, there
       is no reason for "continue" to depend on it.

       DTrace probes for interpreter phase change

       The "phase-change" probes will fire when the interpreter's phase
       changes, which tracks the "${^GLOBAL_PHASE}" variable.  "arg0" is the
       new phase name; "arg1" is the old one.  This is useful for limiting
       your instrumentation to one or more of: compile time, run time, or
       destruct time.

       "__FILE__()" Syntax

       The "__FILE__", "__LINE__" and "__PACKAGE__" tokens can now be written
       with an empty pair of parentheses after them.  This makes them parse
       the same way as "time", "fork" and other built-in functions.

       The "\$" prototype accepts any scalar lvalue

       The "\$" and "\[$]" subroutine prototypes now accept any scalar lvalue
       argument.  Previously they accepted only scalars beginning with "$" and
       hash and array elements.  This change makes them consistent with the
       way the built-in "read" and "recv" functions (among others) parse their
       arguments.  This means that one can override the built-in functions
       with custom subroutines that parse their arguments the same way.

       "_" in subroutine prototypes

       The "_" character in subroutine prototypes is now allowed before "@" or
       "%".

Security
   Use "is_utf8_char_buf()" and not "is_utf8_char()"
       The latter function is now deprecated because its API is insufficient
       to guarantee that it doesn't read (up to 12 bytes in the worst case)
       beyond the end of its input string.  See is_utf8_char_buf().

   Malformed UTF-8 input could cause attempts to read beyond the end of the
       buffer
       Two new XS-accessible functions, "utf8_to_uvchr_buf()" and
       "utf8_to_uvuni_buf()" are now available to prevent this, and the Perl
       core has been converted to use them.  See "Internal Changes".

   "File::Glob::bsd_glob()" memory error with GLOB_ALTDIRFUNC (CVE-2011-2728).
       Calling "File::Glob::bsd_glob" with the unsupported flag
       GLOB_ALTDIRFUNC would cause an access violation / segfault.  A Perl
       program that accepts a flags value from an external source could expose
       itself to denial of service or arbitrary code execution attacks.  There
       are no known exploits in the wild.  The problem has been corrected by
       explicitly disabling all unsupported flags and setting unused function
       pointers to null.  Bug reported by Clement Lecigne. (5.14.2)

   Privileges are now set correctly when assigning to $(
       A hypothetical bug (probably unexploitable in practice) because the
       incorrect setting of the effective group ID while setting $( has been
       fixed.  The bug would have affected only systems that have
       "setresgid()" but not "setregid()", but no such systems are known to
       exist.

Deprecations
   Don't read the Unicode data base files in lib/unicore
       It is now deprecated to directly read the Unicode data base files.
       These are stored in the lib/unicore directory.  Instead, you should use
       the new functions in Unicode::UCD.  These provide a stable API, and
       give complete information.

       Perl may at some point in the future change or remove these files.  The
       file which applications were most likely to have used is
       lib/unicore/ToDigit.pl.  "prop_invmap()" in Unicode::UCD can be used to
       get at its data instead.

   XS functions "is_utf8_char()", "utf8_to_uvchr()" and "utf8_to_uvuni()"
       This function is deprecated because it could read beyond the end of the
       input string.  Use the new is_utf8_char_buf(), "utf8_to_uvchr_buf()"
       and "utf8_to_uvuni_buf()" instead.

Future Deprecations
       This section serves as a notice of features that are likely to be
       removed or deprecated in the next release of perl (5.18.0).  If your
       code depends on these features, you should contact the Perl 5 Porters
       via the mailing list <http://lists.perl.org/list/perl5-porters.html> or
       perlbug to explain your use case and inform the deprecation process.

   Core Modules
       These modules may be marked as deprecated from the core.  This only
       means that they will no longer be installed by default with the core
       distribution, but will remain available on the CPAN.

   Other Future Deprecations
       o   Swapping of $< and $>

           For more information about this future deprecation, see the
           relevant RT ticket
           <https://rt.perl.org/rt3/Ticket/Display.html?id=96212>.

       o   sfio, stdio

           Perl supports being built without PerlIO proper, using a stdio or
           sfio wrapper instead.  A perl build like this will not support IO
           layers and thus Unicode IO, making it rather handicapped.

           PerlIO supports a "stdio" layer if stdio use is desired, and
           similarly a sfio layer could be produced.

       o   Unescaped literal "{" in regular expressions.

           Starting with v5.20, it is planned to require a literal "{" to be
           escaped, for example by preceding it with a backslash.  In v5.18, a
           deprecated warning message will be emitted for all such uses.  This
           affects only patterns that are to match a literal "{".  Other uses
           of this character, such as part of a quantifier or sequence as in
           those below, are completely unaffected:

               /foo{3,5}/
               /\p{Alphabetic}/
               /\N{DIGIT ZERO}

           Removing this will permit extensions to Perl's pattern syntax and
           better error checking for existing syntax.  See "Quantifiers" in
           perlre for an example.

       o   Revamping "\Q" semantics in double-quotish strings when combined
           with other escapes.

           There are several bugs and inconsistencies involving combinations
           of "\Q" and escapes like "\x", "\L", etc., within a "\Q...\E" pair.
           These need to be fixed, and doing so will necessarily change
           current behavior.  The changes have not yet been settled.

Incompatible Changes
   Special blocks called in void context
       Special blocks ("BEGIN", "CHECK", "INIT", "UNITCHECK", "END") are now
       called in void context.  This avoids wasteful copying of the result of
       the last statement [perl #108794].

   The "overloading" pragma and regexp objects
       With "no overloading", regular expression objects returned by "qr//"
       are now stringified as "Regexp=REGEXP(0xbe600d)" instead of the regular
       expression itself [perl #108780].

   Two XS typemap Entries removed
       Two presumably unused XS typemap entries have been removed from the
       core typemap: T_DATAUNIT and T_CALLBACK.  If you are, against all odds,
       a user of these, please see the instructions on how to restore them in
       perlxstypemap.

   Unicode 6.1 has incompatibilities with Unicode 6.0
       These are detailed in "Supports (almost) Unicode 6.1" above.  You can
       compile this version of Perl to use Unicode 6.0.  See "Hacking Perl to
       work on earlier Unicode versions (for very serious hackers only)" in
       perlunicode.

   Borland compiler
       All support for the Borland compiler has been dropped.  The code had
       not worked for a long time anyway.

   Certain deprecated Unicode properties are no longer supported by default
       Perl should never have exposed certain Unicode properties that are used
       by Unicode internally and not meant to be publicly available.  Use of
       these has generated deprecated warning messages since Perl 5.12.  The
       removed properties are Other_Alphabetic,
       Other_Default_Ignorable_Code_Point, Other_Grapheme_Extend,
       Other_ID_Continue, Other_ID_Start, Other_Lowercase, Other_Math, and
       Other_Uppercase.

       Perl may be recompiled to include any or all of them; instructions are
       given in "Unicode character properties that are NOT accepted by Perl"
       in perluniprops.

   Dereferencing IO thingies as typeglobs
       The "*{...}" operator, when passed a reference to an IO thingy (as in
       "*{*STDIN{IO}}"), creates a new typeglob containing just that IO
       object.  Previously, it would stringify as an empty string, but some
       operators would treat it as undefined, producing an "uninitialized"
       warning.  Now it stringifies as __ANONIO__ [perl #96326].

   User-defined case-changing operations
       This feature was deprecated in Perl 5.14, and has now been removed.
       The CPAN module Unicode::Casing provides better functionality without
       the drawbacks that this feature had, as are detailed in the 5.14
       documentation:
       http://perldoc.perl.org/5.14.0/perlunicode.html#User-Defined-Case-Mappings-%28for-serious-hackers-only%29
       <http://perldoc.perl.org/5.14.0/perlunicode.html#User-Defined-Case-
       Mappings-%28for-serious-hackers-only%29>

   XSUBs are now 'static'
       XSUB C functions are now 'static', that is, they are not visible from
       outside the compilation unit.  Users can use the new
       "XS_EXTERNAL(name)" and "XS_INTERNAL(name)" macros to pick the desired
       linking behavior.  The ordinary "XS(name)" declaration for XSUBs will
       continue to declare non-'static' XSUBs for compatibility, but the XS
       compiler, ExtUtils::ParseXS ("xsubpp") will emit 'static' XSUBs by
       default.  ExtUtils::ParseXS's behavior can be reconfigured from XS
       using the "EXPORT_XSUB_SYMBOLS" keyword.  See perlxs for details.

   Weakening read-only references
       Weakening read-only references is no longer permitted.  It should never
       have worked anyway, and could sometimes result in crashes.

   Tying scalars that hold typeglobs
       Attempting to tie a scalar after a typeglob was assigned to it would
       instead tie the handle in the typeglob's IO slot.  This meant that it
       was impossible to tie the scalar itself.  Similar problems affected
       "tied" and "untie": "tied $scalar" would return false on a tied scalar
       if the last thing returned was a typeglob, and "untie $scalar" on such
       a tied scalar would do nothing.

       We fixed this problem before Perl 5.14.0, but it caused problems with
       some CPAN modules, so we put in a deprecation cycle instead.

       Now the deprecation has been removed and this bug has been fixed.  So
       "tie $scalar" will always tie the scalar, not the handle it holds.  To
       tie the handle, use "tie *$scalar" (with an explicit asterisk).  The
       same applies to "tied *$scalar" and "untie *$scalar".

   IPC::Open3 no longer provides "xfork()", "xclose_on_exec()" and
       "xpipe_anon()"
       All three functions were private, undocumented, and unexported.  They
       do not appear to be used by any code on CPAN.  Two have been inlined
       and one deleted entirely.

   $$ no longer caches PID
       Previously, if one called fork(3) from C, Perl's notion of $$ could go
       out of sync with what getpid() returns.  By always fetching the value
       of $$ via getpid(), this potential bug is eliminated.  Code that
       depends on the caching behavior will break.  As described in Core
       Enhancements, $$ is now writable, but it will be reset during a fork.

   $$ and "getppid()" no longer emulate POSIX semantics under LinuxThreads
       The POSIX emulation of $$ and "getppid()" under the obsolete
       LinuxThreads implementation has been removed.  This only impacts users
       of Linux 2.4 and users of Debian GNU/kFreeBSD up to and including 6.0,
       not the vast majority of Linux installations that use NPTL threads.

       This means that "getppid()", like $$, is now always guaranteed to
       return the OS's idea of the current state of the process, not perl's
       cached version of it.

       See the documentation for $$ for details.

   $<, $>, $( and $) are no longer cached
       Similarly to the changes to $$ and "getppid()", the internal caching of
       $<, $>, $( and $) has been removed.

       When we cached these values our idea of what they were would drift out
       of sync with reality if someone (e.g., someone embedding perl) called
       "sete?[ug]id()" without updating "PL_e?[ug]id".  Having to deal with
       this complexity wasn't worth it given how cheap the "gete?[ug]id()"
       system call is.

       This change will break a handful of CPAN modules that use the XS-level
       "PL_uid", "PL_gid", "PL_euid" or "PL_egid" variables.

       The fix for those breakages is to use "PerlProc_gete?[ug]id()" to
       retrieve them (e.g., "PerlProc_getuid()"), and not to assign to
       "PL_e?[ug]id" if you change the UID/GID/EUID/EGID.  There is no longer
       any need to do so since perl will always retrieve the up-to-date
       version of those values from the OS.

   Which Non-ASCII characters get quoted by "quotemeta" and "\Q" has changed
       This is unlikely to result in a real problem, as Perl does not attach
       special meaning to any non-ASCII character, so it is currently
       irrelevant which are quoted or not.  This change fixes bug [perl
       #77654] and brings Perl's behavior more into line with Unicode's
       recommendations.  See "quotemeta" in perlfunc.

Performance Enhancements
       o   Improved performance for Unicode properties in regular expressions

           Matching a code point against a Unicode property is now done via a
           binary search instead of linear.  This means for example that the
           worst case for a 1000 item property is 10 probes instead of 1000.
           This inefficiency has been compensated for in the past by
           permanently storing in a hash the results of a given probe plus the
           results for the adjacent 64 code points, under the theory that
           near-by code points are likely to be searched for.  A separate hash
           was used for each mention of a Unicode property in each regular
           expression.  Thus, "qr/\p{foo}abc\p{foo}/" would generate two
           hashes.  Any probes in one instance would be unknown to the other,
           and the hashes could expand separately to be quite large if the
           regular expression were used on many different widely-separated
           code points.  Now, however, there is just one hash shared by all
           instances of a given property.  This means that if "\p{foo}" is
           matched against "A" in one regular expression in a thread, the
           result will be known immediately to all regular expressions, and
           the relentless march of using up memory is slowed considerably.

       o   Version declarations with the "use" keyword (e.g., "use 5.012") are
           now faster, as they enable features without loading feature.pm.

       o   "local $_" is faster now, as it no longer iterates through magic
           that it is not going to copy anyway.

       o   Perl 5.12.0 sped up the destruction of objects whose classes define
           empty "DESTROY" methods (to prevent autoloading), by simply not
           calling such empty methods.  This release takes this optimization a
           step further, by not calling any "DESTROY" method that begins with
           a "return" statement.  This can be useful for destructors that are
           only used for debugging:

               use constant DEBUG => 1;
               sub DESTROY { return unless DEBUG; ... }

           Constant-folding will reduce the first statement to "return;" if
           DEBUG is set to 0, triggering this optimization.

       o   Assigning to a variable that holds a typeglob or copy-on-write
           scalar is now much faster.  Previously the typeglob would be
           stringified or the copy-on-write scalar would be copied before
           being clobbered.

       o   Assignment to "substr" in void context is now more than twice its
           previous speed.  Instead of creating and returning a special lvalue
           scalar that is then assigned to, "substr" modifies the original
           string itself.

       o   "substr" no longer calculates a value to return when called in void
           context.

       o   Due to changes in File::Glob, Perl's "glob" function and its
           "<...>" equivalent are now much faster.  The splitting of the
           pattern into words has been rewritten in C, resulting in speed-ups
           of 20% for some cases.

           This does not affect "glob" on VMS, as it does not use File::Glob.

       o   The short-circuiting operators "&&", "||", and "//", when chained
           (such as "$a || $b || $c"), are now considerably faster to short-
           circuit, due to reduced optree traversal.

       o   The implementation of "s///r" makes one fewer copy of the scalar's
           value.

       o   Recursive calls to lvalue subroutines in lvalue scalar context use
           less memory.

Modules and Pragmata
   Deprecated Modules
       Version::Requirements
           Version::Requirements is now DEPRECATED, use
           CPAN::Meta::Requirements, which is a drop-in replacement.  It will
           be deleted from perl.git blead in v5.17.0.

   New Modules and Pragmata
       o   arybase -- this new module implements the $[ variable.

       o   PerlIO::mmap 0.010 has been added to the Perl core.

           The "mmap" PerlIO layer is no longer implemented by perl itself,
           but has been moved out into the new PerlIO::mmap module.

   Updated Modules and Pragmata
       This is only an overview of selected module updates.  For a complete
       list of updates, run:

           $ corelist --diff 5.14.0 5.16.0

       You can substitute your favorite version in place of 5.14.0, too.

       o   Archive::Extract has been upgraded from version 0.48 to 0.58.

           Includes a fix for FreeBSD to only use "unzip" if it is located in
           "/usr/local/bin", as FreeBSD 9.0 will ship with a limited "unzip"
           in "/usr/bin".

       o   Archive::Tar has been upgraded from version 1.76 to 1.82.

           Adjustments to handle files >8gb (>0777777777777 octal) and a
           feature to return the MD5SUM of files in the archive.

       o   base has been upgraded from version 2.16 to 2.18.

           "base" no longer sets a module's $VERSION to "-1" when a module it
           loads does not define a $VERSION.  This change has been made
           because "-1" is not a valid version number under the new "lax"
           criteria used internally by "UNIVERSAL::VERSION".  (See version for
           more on "lax" version criteria.)

           "base" no longer internally skips loading modules it has already
           loaded and instead relies on "require" to inspect %INC.  This fixes
           a bug when "base" is used with code that clear %INC to force a
           module to be reloaded.

       o   Carp has been upgraded from version 1.20 to 1.26.

           It now includes last read filehandle info and puts a dot after the
           file and line number, just like errors from "die" [perl #106538].

       o   charnames has been updated from version 1.18 to 1.30.

           "charnames" can now be invoked with a new option, ":loose", which
           is like the existing ":full" option, but enables Unicode loose name
           matching.  Details are in "LOOSE MATCHES" in charnames.

       o   B::Deparse has been upgraded from version 1.03 to 1.14.  This fixes
           numerous deparsing bugs.

       o   CGI has been upgraded from version 3.52 to 3.59.

           It uses the public and documented FCGI.pm API in CGI::Fast.
           CGI::Fast was using an FCGI API that was deprecated and removed
           from documentation more than ten years ago.  Usage of this
           deprecated API with FCGI >= 0.70 or FCGI <= 0.73 introduces a
           security issue.
           <https://rt.cpan.org/Public/Bug/Display.html?id=68380>
           http://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2011-2766
           <http://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2011-2766>

           Things that may break your code:

           "url()" was fixed to return "PATH_INFO" when it is explicitly
           requested with either the "path=>1" or "path_info=>1" flag.

           If your code is running under mod_rewrite (or compatible) and you
           are calling "self_url()" or you are calling "url()" and passing
           "path_info=>1", these methods will actually be returning
           "PATH_INFO" now, as you have explicitly requested or "self_url()"
           has requested on your behalf.

           The "PATH_INFO" has been omitted in such URLs since the issue was
           introduced in the 3.12 release in December, 2005.

           This bug is so old your application may have come to depend on it
           or workaround it. Check for application before upgrading to this
           release.

           Examples of affected method calls:

             $q->url(-absolute => 1, -query => 1, -path_info => 1);
             $q->url(-path=>1);
             $q->url(-full=>1,-path=>1);
             $q->url(-rewrite=>1,-path=>1);
             $q->self_url();

           We no longer read from STDIN when the Content-Length is not set,
           preventing requests with no Content-Length from sometimes freezing.
           This is consistent with the CGI RFC 3875, and is also consistent
           with CGI::Simple.  However, the old behavior may have been expected
           by some command-line uses of CGI.pm.

           In addition, the DELETE HTTP verb is now supported.

       o   Compress::Zlib has been upgraded from version 2.035 to 2.048.

           IO::Compress::Zip and IO::Uncompress::Unzip now have support for
           LZMA (method 14).  There is a fix for a CRC issue in
           IO::Compress::Unzip and it supports Streamed Stored context now.
           And fixed a Zip64 issue in IO::Compress::Zip when the content size
           was exactly 0xFFFFFFFF.

       o   Digest::SHA has been upgraded from version 5.61 to 5.71.

           Added BITS mode to the addfile method and shasum.  This makes
           partial-byte inputs possible via files/STDIN and lets shasum check
           all 8074 NIST Msg vectors, where previously special programming was
           required to do this.

       o   Encode has been upgraded from version 2.42 to 2.44.

           Missing aliases added, a deep recursion error fixed and various
           documentation updates.

           Addressed 'decode_xs n-byte heap-overflow' security bug in
           Unicode.xs (CVE-2011-2939). (5.14.2)

       o   ExtUtils::CBuilder updated from version 0.280203 to 0.280206.

           The new version appends CFLAGS and LDFLAGS to their Config.pm
           counterparts.

       o   ExtUtils::ParseXS has been upgraded from version 2.2210 to 3.16.

           Much of ExtUtils::ParseXS, the module behind the XS compiler
           "xsubpp", was rewritten and cleaned up.  It has been made somewhat
           more extensible and now finally uses strictures.

           The typemap logic has been moved into a separate module,
           ExtUtils::Typemaps.  See "New Modules and Pragmata", above.

           For a complete set of changes, please see the ExtUtils::ParseXS
           changelog, available on the CPAN.

       o   File::Glob has been upgraded from version 1.12 to 1.17.

           On Windows, tilde (~) expansion now checks the "USERPROFILE"
           environment variable, after checking "HOME".

           It has a new ":bsd_glob" export tag, intended to replace ":glob".
           Like ":glob" it overrides "glob" with a function that does not
           split the glob pattern into words, but, unlike ":glob", it iterates
           properly in scalar context, instead of returning the last file.

           There are other changes affecting Perl's own "glob" operator (which
           uses File::Glob internally, except on VMS).  See "Performance
           Enhancements" and "Selected Bug Fixes".

       o   FindBin updated from version 1.50 to 1.51.

           It no longer returns a wrong result if a script of the same name as
           the current one exists in the path and is executable.

       o   HTTP::Tiny has been upgraded from version 0.012 to 0.017.

           Added support for using $ENV{http_proxy} to set the default proxy
           host.

           Adds additional shorthand methods for all common HTTP verbs, a
           "post_form()" method for POST-ing x-www-form-urlencoded data and a
           "www_form_urlencode()" utility method.

       o   IO has been upgraded from version 1.25_04 to 1.25_06, and
           IO::Handle from version 1.31 to 1.33.

           Together, these upgrades fix a problem with IO::Handle's "getline"
           and "getlines" methods.  When these methods are called on the
           special ARGV handle, the next file is automatically opened, as
           happens with the built-in "<>" and "readline" functions.  But,
           unlike the built-ins, these methods were not respecting the
           caller's use of the open pragma and applying the appropriate I/O
           layers to the newly-opened file [rt.cpan.org #66474].

       o   IPC::Cmd has been upgraded from version 0.70 to 0.76.

           Capturing of command output (both "STDOUT" and "STDERR") is now
           supported using IPC::Open3 on MSWin32 without requiring IPC::Run.

       o   IPC::Open3 has been upgraded from version 1.09 to 1.12.

           Fixes a bug which prevented use of "open3" on Windows when *STDIN,
           *STDOUT or *STDERR had been localized.

           Fixes a bug which prevented duplicating numeric file descriptors on
           Windows.

           "open3" with "-" for the program name works once more.  This was
           broken in version 1.06 (and hence in Perl 5.14.0) [perl #95748].

       o   Locale::Codes has been upgraded from version 3.16 to 3.21.

           Added Language Extension codes (langext) and Language Variation
           codes (langvar) as defined in the IANA language registry.

           Added language codes from ISO 639-5

           Added language/script codes from the IANA language subtag registry

           Fixed an uninitialized value warning [rt.cpan.org #67438].

           Fixed the return value for the all_XXX_codes and all_XXX_names
           functions [rt.cpan.org #69100].

           Reorganized modules to move Locale::MODULE to Locale::Codes::MODULE
           to allow for cleaner future additions.  The original four modules
           (Locale::Language, Locale::Currency, Locale::Country,
           Locale::Script) will continue to work, but all new sets of codes
           will be added in the Locale::Codes namespace.

           The code2XXX, XXX2code, all_XXX_codes, and all_XXX_names functions
           now support retired codes.  All codesets may be specified by a
           constant or by their name now.  Previously, they were specified
           only by a constant.

           The alias_code function exists for backward compatibility.  It has
           been replaced by rename_country_code.  The alias_code function will
           be removed some time after September, 2013.

           All work is now done in the central module (Locale::Codes).
           Previously, some was still done in the wrapper modules
           (Locale::Codes::*).  Added Language Family codes (langfam) as
           defined in ISO 639-5.

       o   Math::BigFloat has been upgraded from version 1.993 to 1.997.

           The "numify" method has been corrected to return a normalized Perl
           number (the result of "0 + $thing"), instead of a string
           [rt.cpan.org #66732].

       o   Math::BigInt has been upgraded from version 1.994 to 1.998.

           It provides a new "bsgn" method that complements the "babs" method.

           It fixes the internal "objectify" function's handling of "foreign
           objects" so they are converted to the appropriate class
           (Math::BigInt or Math::BigFloat).

       o   Math::BigRat has been upgraded from version 0.2602 to 0.2603.

           "int()" on a Math::BigRat object containing -1/2 now creates a
           Math::BigInt containing 0, rather than -0.  Math::BigInt does not
           even support negative zero, so the resulting object was actually
           malformed [perl #95530].

       o   Math::Complex has been upgraded from version 1.56 to 1.59 and
           Math::Trig from version 1.2 to 1.22.

           Fixes include: correct copy constructor usage; fix polarwise
           formatting with numeric format specifier; and more stable
           "great_circle_direction" algorithm.

       o   Module::CoreList has been upgraded from version 2.51 to 2.66.

           The "corelist" utility now understands the "-r" option for
           displaying Perl release dates and the "--diff" option to print the
           set of modlib changes between two perl distributions.

       o   Module::Metadata has been upgraded from version 1.000004 to
           1.000009.

           Adds "provides" method to generate a CPAN META provides data
           structure correctly; use of "package_versions_from_directory" is
           discouraged.

       o   ODBM_File has been upgraded from version 1.10 to 1.12.

           The XS code is now compiled with "PERL_NO_GET_CONTEXT", which will
           aid performance under ithreads.

       o   open has been upgraded from version 1.08 to 1.10.

           It no longer turns off layers on standard handles when invoked
           without the ":std" directive.  Similarly, when invoked with the
           ":std" directive, it now clears layers on STDERR before applying
           the new ones, and not just on STDIN and STDOUT [perl #92728].

       o   overload has been upgraded from version 1.13 to 1.18.

           "overload::Overloaded" no longer calls "can" on the class, but uses
           another means to determine whether the object has overloading.  It
           was never correct for it to call "can", as overloading does not
           respect AUTOLOAD.  So classes that autoload methods and implement
           "can" no longer have to account for overloading [perl #40333].

           A warning is now produced for invalid arguments.  See "New
           Diagnostics".

       o   PerlIO::scalar has been upgraded from version 0.11 to 0.14.

           (This is the module that implements "open $fh, '>', \$scalar".)

           It fixes a problem with "open my $fh, ">", \$scalar" not working if
           $scalar is a copy-on-write scalar. (5.14.2)

           It also fixes a hang that occurs with "readline" or "<$fh>" if a
           typeglob has been assigned to $scalar [perl #92258].

           It no longer assumes during "seek" that $scalar is a string
           internally.  If it didn't crash, it was close to doing so [perl
           #92706].  Also, the internal print routine no longer assumes that
           the position set by "seek" is valid, but extends the string to that
           position, filling the intervening bytes (between the old length and
           the seek position) with nulls [perl #78980].

           Printing to an in-memory handle now works if the $scalar holds a
           reference, stringifying the reference before modifying it.
           References used to be treated as empty strings.

           Printing to an in-memory handle no longer crashes if the $scalar
           happens to hold a number internally, but no string buffer.

           Printing to an in-memory handle no longer creates scalars that
           confuse the regular expression engine [perl #108398].

       o   Pod::Functions has been upgraded from version 1.04 to 1.05.

           Functions.pm is now generated at perl build time from annotations
           in perlfunc.pod.  This will ensure that Pod::Functions and perlfunc
           remain in synchronisation.

       o   Pod::Html has been upgraded from version 1.11 to 1.1502.

           This is an extensive rewrite of Pod::Html to use Pod::Simple under
           the hood.  The output has changed significantly.

       o   Pod::Perldoc has been upgraded from version 3.15_03 to 3.17.

           It corrects the search paths on VMS [perl #90640]. (5.14.1)

           The -v option now fetches the right section for $0.

           This upgrade has numerous significant fixes.  Consult its changelog
           on the CPAN for more information.

       o   POSIX has been upgraded from version 1.24 to 1.30.

           POSIX no longer uses AutoLoader.  Any code which was relying on
           this implementation detail was buggy, and may fail because of this
           change.  The module's Perl code has been considerably simplified,
           roughly halving the number of lines, with no change in
           functionality.  The XS code has been refactored to reduce the size
           of the shared object by about 12%, with no change in functionality.
           More POSIX functions now have tests.

           "sigsuspend" and "pause" now run signal handlers before returning,
           as the whole point of these two functions is to wait until a signal
           has arrived, and then return after it has been triggered.  Delayed,
           or "safe", signals were preventing that from happening, possibly
           resulting in race conditions [perl #107216].

           "POSIX::sleep" is now a direct call into the underlying OS "sleep"
           function, instead of being a Perl wrapper on "CORE::sleep".
           "POSIX::dup2" now returns the correct value on Win32 (i.e., the
           file descriptor).  "POSIX::SigSet" "sigsuspend" and "sigpending"
           and "POSIX::pause" now dispatch safe signals immediately before
           returning to their caller.

           "POSIX::Termios::setattr" now defaults the third argument to
           "TCSANOW", instead of 0. On most platforms "TCSANOW" is defined to
           be 0, but on some 0 is not a valid parameter, which caused a call
           with defaults to fail.

       o   Socket has been upgraded from version 1.94 to 2.001.

           It has new functions and constants for handling IPv6 sockets:

               pack_ipv6_mreq
               unpack_ipv6_mreq
               IPV6_ADD_MEMBERSHIP
               IPV6_DROP_MEMBERSHIP
               IPV6_MTU
               IPV6_MTU_DISCOVER
               IPV6_MULTICAST_HOPS
               IPV6_MULTICAST_IF
               IPV6_MULTICAST_LOOP
               IPV6_UNICAST_HOPS
               IPV6_V6ONLY

       o   Storable has been upgraded from version 2.27 to 2.34.

           It no longer turns copy-on-write scalars into read-only scalars
           when freezing and thawing.

       o   Sys::Syslog has been upgraded from version 0.27 to 0.29.

           This upgrade closes many outstanding bugs.

       o   Term::ANSIColor has been upgraded from version 3.00 to 3.01.

           Only interpret an initial array reference as a list of colors, not
           any initial reference, allowing the colored function to work
           properly on objects with stringification defined.

       o   Term::ReadLine has been upgraded from version 1.07 to 1.09.

           Term::ReadLine now supports any event loop, including unpublished
           ones and simple IO::Select, loops without the need to rewrite
           existing code for any particular framework [perl #108470].

       o   threads::shared has been upgraded from version 1.37 to 1.40.

           Destructors on shared objects used to be ignored sometimes if the
           objects were referenced only by shared data structures.  This has
           been mostly fixed, but destructors may still be ignored if the
           objects still exist at global destruction time [perl #98204].

       o   Unicode::Collate has been upgraded from version 0.73 to 0.89.

           Updated to CLDR 1.9.1

           Locales updated to CLDR 2.0: mk, mt, nb, nn, ro, ru, sk, sr, sv,
           uk, zh__pinyin, zh__stroke

           Newly supported locales: bn, fa, ml, mr, or, pa, sa, si,
           si__dictionary, sr_Latn, sv__reformed, ta, te, th, ur, wae.

           Tailored compatibility ideographs as well as unified ideographs for
           the locales: ja, ko, zh__big5han, zh__gb2312han, zh__pinyin,
           zh__stroke.

           Locale/*.pl files are now searched for in @INC.

       o   Unicode::Normalize has been upgraded from version 1.10 to 1.14.

           Fixes for the removal of unicore/CompositionExclusions.txt from
           core.

       o   Unicode::UCD has been upgraded from version 0.32 to 0.43.

           This adds four new functions:  "prop_aliases()" and
           "prop_value_aliases()", which are used to find all Unicode-approved
           synonyms for property names, or to convert from one name to
           another; "prop_invlist" which returns all code points matching a
           given Unicode binary property; and "prop_invmap" which returns the
           complete specification of a given Unicode property.

       o   Win32API::File has been upgraded from version 0.1101 to 0.1200.

           Added SetStdHandle and GetStdHandle functions

   Removed Modules and Pragmata
       As promised in Perl 5.14.0's release notes, the following modules have
       been removed from the core distribution, and if needed should be
       installed from CPAN instead.

       o   Devel::DProf has been removed from the Perl core.  Prior version
           was 20110228.00.

       o   Shell has been removed from the Perl core.  Prior version was
           0.72_01.

       o   Several old perl4-style libraries which have been deprecated with
           5.14 are now removed:

               abbrev.pl assert.pl bigfloat.pl bigint.pl bigrat.pl cacheout.pl
               complete.pl ctime.pl dotsh.pl exceptions.pl fastcwd.pl flush.pl
               getcwd.pl getopt.pl getopts.pl hostname.pl importenv.pl
               lib/find{,depth}.pl look.pl newgetopt.pl open2.pl open3.pl
               pwd.pl shellwords.pl stat.pl tainted.pl termcap.pl timelocal.pl

           They can be found on CPAN as Perl4::CoreLibs.

Documentation
   New Documentation
       perldtrace

       perldtrace describes Perl's DTrace support, listing the provided probes
       and gives examples of their use.

       perlexperiment

       This document is intended to provide a list of experimental features in
       Perl.  It is still a work in progress.

       perlootut

       This a new OO tutorial.  It focuses on basic OO concepts, and then
       recommends that readers choose an OO framework from CPAN.

       perlxstypemap

       The new manual describes the XS typemapping mechanism in unprecedented
       detail and combines new documentation with information extracted from
       perlxs and the previously unofficial list of all core typemaps.

   Changes to Existing Documentation
       perlapi

       o   The HV API has long accepted negative lengths to show that the key
           is in UTF8.  This is now documented.

       o   The "boolSV()" macro is now documented.

       perlfunc

       o   "dbmopen" treats a 0 mode as a special case, that prevents a
           nonexistent file from being created.  This has been the case since
           Perl 5.000, but was never documented anywhere.  Now the perlfunc
           entry mentions it [perl #90064].

       o   As an accident of history, "open $fh, '<:', ..." applies the
           default layers for the platform (":raw" on Unix, ":crlf" on
           Windows), ignoring whatever is declared by open.pm.  This seems
           such a useful feature it has been documented in perlfunc and open.

       o   The entry for "split" has been rewritten.  It is now far clearer
           than before.

       perlguts

       o   A new section, Autoloading with XSUBs, has been added, which
           explains the two APIs for accessing the name of the autoloaded sub.

       o   Some function descriptions in perlguts were confusing, as it was
           not clear whether they referred to the function above or below the
           description.  This has been clarified [perl #91790].

       perlobj

       o   This document has been rewritten from scratch, and its coverage of
           various OO concepts has been expanded.

       perlop

       o   Documentation of the smartmatch operator has been reworked and
           moved from perlsyn to perlop where it belongs.

           It has also been corrected for the case of "undef" on the left-hand
           side.  The list of different smart match behaviors had an item in
           the wrong place.

       o   Documentation of the ellipsis statement ("...") has been reworked
           and moved from perlop to perlsyn.

       o   The explanation of bitwise operators has been expanded to explain
           how they work on Unicode strings (5.14.1).

       o   More examples for "m//g" have been added (5.14.1).

       o   The "<<\FOO" here-doc syntax has been documented (5.14.1).

       perlpragma

       o   There is now a standard convention for naming keys in the "%^H",
           documented under Key naming.

       "Laundering and Detecting Tainted Data" in perlsec

       o   The example function for checking for taintedness contained a
           subtle error.  $@ needs to be localized to prevent its changing
           this global's value outside the function.  The preferred method to
           check for this remains "tainted" in Scalar::Util.

       perllol

       o   perllol has been expanded with examples using the new "push
           $scalar" syntax introduced in Perl 5.14.0 (5.14.1).

       perlmod

       o   perlmod now states explicitly that some types of explicit symbol
           table manipulation are not supported.  This codifies what was
           effectively already the case [perl #78074].

       perlpodstyle

       o   The tips on which formatting codes to use have been corrected and
           greatly expanded.

       o   There are now a couple of example one-liners for previewing POD
           files after they have been edited.

       perlre

       o   The "(*COMMIT)" directive is now listed in the right section (Verbs
           without an argument).

       perlrun

       o   perlrun has undergone a significant clean-up.  Most notably, the
           -0x... form of the -0 flag has been clarified, and the final
           section on environment variables has been corrected and expanded
           (5.14.1).

       perlsub

       o   The ($;) prototype syntax, which has existed for rather a long
           time, is now documented in perlsub.  It lets a unary function have
           the same precedence as a list operator.

       perltie

       o   The required syntax for tying handles has been documented.

       perlvar

       o   The documentation for $! has been corrected and clarified.  It used
           to state that $! could be "undef", which is not the case.  It was
           also unclear whether system calls set C's "errno" or Perl's $!
           [perl #91614].

       o   Documentation for $$ has been amended with additional cautions
           regarding changing the process ID.

       Other Changes

       o   perlxs was extended with documentation on inline typemaps.

       o   perlref has a new Circular References section explaining how
           circularities may not be freed and how to solve that with weak
           references.

       o   Parts of perlapi were clarified, and Perl equivalents of some C
           functions have been added as an additional mode of exposition.

       o   A few parts of perlre and perlrecharclass were clarified.

   Removed Documentation
       Old OO Documentation

       The old OO tutorials, perltoot, perltooc, and perlboot, have been
       removed.  The perlbot (bag of object tricks) document has been removed
       as well.

       Development Deltas

       The perldelta files for development releases are no longer packaged
       with perl.  These can still be found in the perl source code
       repository.

Diagnostics
       The following additions or changes have been made to diagnostic output,
       including warnings and fatal error messages.  For the complete list of
       diagnostic messages, see perldiag.

   New Diagnostics
       New Errors

       o   Cannot set tied @DB::args

           This error occurs when "caller" tries to set @DB::args but finds it
           tied.  Before this error was added, it used to crash instead.

       o   Cannot tie unreifiable array

           This error is part of a safety check that the "tie" operator does
           before tying a special array like @_.  You should never see this
           message.

       o   &CORE::%s cannot be called directly

           This occurs when a subroutine in the "CORE::" namespace is called
           with &foo syntax or through a reference.  Some subroutines in this
           package cannot yet be called that way, but must be called as
           barewords.  See "Subroutines in the "CORE" namespace", above.

       o   Source filters apply only to byte streams

           This new error occurs when you try to activate a source filter
           (usually by loading a source filter module) within a string passed
           to "eval" under the "unicode_eval" feature.

       New Warnings

       o   defined(@array) is deprecated

           The long-deprecated "defined(@array)" now also warns for package
           variables.  Previously it issued a warning for lexical variables
           only.

       o   length() used on %s

           This new warning occurs when "length" is used on an array or hash,
           instead of "scalar(@array)" or "scalar(keys %hash)".

       o   lvalue attribute %s already-defined subroutine

           attributes.pm now emits this warning when the :lvalue attribute is
           applied to a Perl subroutine that has already been defined, as
           doing so can have unexpected side-effects.

       o   overload arg '%s' is invalid

           This warning, in the "overload" category, is produced when the
           overload pragma is given an argument it doesn't recognize,
           presumably a mistyped operator.

       o   $[ used in %s (did you mean $] ?)

           This new warning exists to catch the mistaken use of $[ in version
           checks.  $], not $[, contains the version number.

       o   Useless assignment to a temporary

           Assigning to a temporary scalar returned from an lvalue subroutine
           now produces this warning [perl #31946].

       o   Useless use of \E

           "\E" does nothing unless preceded by "\Q", "\L" or "\U".

   Removed Errors
       o   "sort is now a reserved word"

           This error used to occur when "sort" was called without arguments,
           followed by ";" or ")".  (E.g., "sort;" would die, but "{sort}" was
           OK.)  This error message was added in Perl 3 to catch code like
           "close(sort)" which would no longer work.  More than two decades
           later, this message is no longer appropriate.  Now "sort" without
           arguments is always allowed, and returns an empty list, as it did
           in those cases where it was already allowed [perl #90030].

   Changes to Existing Diagnostics
       o   The "Applying pattern match..." or similar warning produced when an
           array or hash is on the left-hand side of the "=~" operator now
           mentions the name of the variable.

       o   The "Attempt to free non-existent shared string" has had the
           spelling of "non-existent" corrected to "nonexistent".  It was
           already listed with the correct spelling in perldiag.

       o   The error messages for using "default" and "when" outside a
           topicalizer have been standardized to match the messages for
           "continue" and loop controls.  They now read 'Can't "default"
           outside a topicalizer' and 'Can't "when" outside a topicalizer'.
           They both used to be 'Can't use when() outside a topicalizer' [perl
           #91514].

       o   The message, "Code point 0x%X is not Unicode, no properties match
           it; all inverse properties do" has been changed to "Code point 0x%X
           is not Unicode, all \p{} matches fail; all \P{} matches succeed".

       o   Redefinition warnings for constant subroutines used to be
           mandatory, even occurring under "no warnings".  Now they respect
           the warnings pragma.

       o   The "glob failed" warning message is now suppressible via "no
           warnings" [perl #111656].

       o   The Invalid version format error message now says "negative version
           number" within the parentheses, rather than "non-numeric data", for
           negative numbers.

       o   The two warnings Possible attempt to put comments in qw() list and
           Possible attempt to separate words with commas are no longer
           mutually exclusive: the same "qw" construct may produce both.

       o   The uninitialized warning for "y///r" when $_ is implicit and
           undefined now mentions the variable name, just like the non-/r
           variation of the operator.

       o   The 'Use of "foo" without parentheses is ambiguous' warning has
           been extended to apply also to user-defined subroutines with a (;$)
           prototype, and not just to built-in functions.

       o   Warnings that mention the names of lexical ("my") variables with
           Unicode characters in them now respect the presence or absence of
           the ":utf8" layer on the output handle, instead of outputting UTF8
           regardless.  Also, the correct names are included in the strings
           passed to $SIG{__WARN__} handlers, rather than the raw UTF8 bytes.

Utility Changes
       h2ph

       o   h2ph used to generate code of the form

             unless(defined(&FOO)) {
               sub FOO () {42;}
             }

           But the subroutine is a compile-time declaration, and is hence
           unaffected by the condition.  It has now been corrected to emit a
           string "eval" around the subroutine [perl #99368].

       splain

       o   splain no longer emits backtraces with the first line number
           repeated.

           This:

               Uncaught exception from user code:
                       Cannot fwiddle the fwuddle at -e line 1.
                at -e line 1
                       main::baz() called at -e line 1
                       main::bar() called at -e line 1
                       main::foo() called at -e line 1

           has become this:

               Uncaught exception from user code:
                       Cannot fwiddle the fwuddle at -e line 1.
                       main::baz() called at -e line 1
                       main::bar() called at -e line 1
                       main::foo() called at -e line 1

       o   Some error messages consist of multiple lines that are listed as
           separate entries in perldiag.  splain has been taught to find the
           separate entries in these cases, instead of simply failing to find
           the message.

       zipdetails

       o   This is a new utility, included as part of an IO::Compress::Base
           upgrade.

           zipdetails displays information about the internal record structure
           of the zip file.  It is not concerned with displaying any details
           of the compressed data stored in the zip file.

Configuration and Compilation
       o   regexp.h has been modified for compatibility with GCC's -Werror
           option, as used by some projects that include perl's header files
           (5.14.1).

       o   "USE_LOCALE{,_COLLATE,_CTYPE,_NUMERIC}" have been added the output
           of perl -V as they have affect the behavior of the interpreter
           binary (albeit in only a small area).

       o   The code and tests for IPC::Open2 have been moved from
           ext/IPC-Open2 into ext/IPC-Open3, as "IPC::Open2::open2()" is
           implemented as a thin wrapper around "IPC::Open3::_open3()", and
           hence is very tightly coupled to it.

       o   The magic types and magic vtables are now generated from data in a
           new script regen/mg_vtable.pl, instead of being maintained by hand.
           As different EBCDIC variants can't agree on the code point for '~',
           the character to code point conversion is done at build time by
           generate_uudmap to a new generated header mg_data.h.  "PL_vtbl_bm"
           and "PL_vtbl_fm" are now defined by the pre-processor as
           "PL_vtbl_regexp", instead of being distinct C variables.
           "PL_vtbl_sig" has been removed.

       o   Building with "-DPERL_GLOBAL_STRUCT" works again.  This
           configuration is not generally used.

       o   Perl configured with MAD now correctly frees "MADPROP" structures
           when OPs are freed.  "MADPROP"s are now allocated with
           "PerlMemShared_malloc()"

       o   makedef.pl has been refactored.  This should have no noticeable
           affect on any of the platforms that use it as part of their build
           (AIX, VMS, Win32).

       o   "useperlio" can no longer be disabled.

       o   The file global.sym is no longer needed, and has been removed.  It
           contained a list of all exported functions, one of the files
           generated by regen/embed.pl from data in embed.fnc and
           regen/opcodes.  The code has been refactored so that the only user
           of global.sym, makedef.pl, now reads embed.fnc and regen/opcodes
           directly, removing the need to store the list of exported functions
           in an intermediate file.

           As global.sym was never installed, this change should not be
           visible outside the build process.

       o   pod/buildtoc, used by the build process to build perltoc, has been
           refactored and simplified.  It now contains only code to build
           perltoc; the code to regenerate Makefiles has been moved to
           Porting/pod_rules.pl.  It's a bug if this change has any material
           effect on the build process.

       o   pod/roffitall is now built by pod/buildtoc, instead of being
           shipped with the distribution.  Its list of manpages is now
           generated (and therefore current).  See also RT #103202 for an
           unresolved related issue.

       o   The man page for "XS::Typemap" is no longer installed.
           "XS::Typemap" is a test module which is not installed, hence
           installing its documentation makes no sense.

       o   The -Dusesitecustomize and -Duserelocatableinc options now work
           together properly.

Platform Support
   Platform-Specific Notes
       Cygwin

       o   Since version 1.7, Cygwin supports native UTF-8 paths.  If Perl is
           built under that environment, directory and filenames will be UTF-8
           encoded.

       o   Cygwin does not initialize all original Win32 environment
           variables.  See README.cygwin for a discussion of the newly-added
           "Cygwin::sync_winenv()" function [perl #110190] and for further
           links.

       HP-UX

       o   HP-UX PA-RISC/64 now supports gcc-4.x

           A fix to correct the socketsize now makes the test suite pass on
           HP-UX PA-RISC for 64bitall builds. (5.14.2)

       VMS

       o   Remove unnecessary includes, fix miscellaneous compiler warnings
           and close some unclosed comments on vms/vms.c.

       o   Remove sockadapt layer from the VMS build.

       o   Explicit support for VMS versions before v7.0 and DEC C versions
           before v6.0 has been removed.

       o   Since Perl 5.10.1, the home-grown "stat" wrapper has been unable to
           distinguish between a directory name containing an underscore and
           an otherwise-identical filename containing a dot in the same
           position (e.g., t/test_pl as a directory and t/test.pl as a file).
           This problem has been corrected.

       o   The build on VMS now permits names of the resulting symbols in C
           code for Perl longer than 31 characters.  Symbols like
           "Perl__it_was_the_best_of_times_it_was_the_worst_of_times" can now
           be created freely without causing the VMS linker to seize up.

       GNU/Hurd

       o   Numerous build and test failures on GNU/Hurd have been resolved
           with hints for building DBM modules, detection of the library
           search path, and enabling of large file support.

       OpenVOS

       o   Perl is now built with dynamic linking on OpenVOS, the minimum
           supported version of which is now Release 17.1.0.

       SunOS

       The CC workshop C++ compiler is now detected and used on systems that
       ship without cc.

Internal Changes
       o   The compiled representation of formats is now stored via the
           "mg_ptr" of their "PERL_MAGIC_fm".  Previously it was stored in the
           string buffer, beyond "SvLEN()", the regular end of the string.
           "SvCOMPILED()" and "SvCOMPILED_{on,off}()" now exist solely for
           compatibility for XS code.  The first is always 0, the other two
           now no-ops. (5.14.1)

       o   Some global variables have been marked "const", members in the
           interpreter structure have been re-ordered, and the opcodes have
           been re-ordered.  The op "OP_AELEMFAST" has been split into
           "OP_AELEMFAST" and "OP_AELEMFAST_LEX".

       o   When empting a hash of its elements (e.g., via undef(%h), or
           %h=()), HvARRAY field is no longer temporarily zeroed.  Any
           destructors called on the freed elements see the remaining
           elements.  Thus, %h=() becomes more like "delete $h{$_} for keys
           %h".

       o   Boyer-Moore compiled scalars are now PVMGs, and the Boyer-Moore
           tables are now stored via the mg_ptr of their "PERL_MAGIC_bm".
           Previously they were PVGVs, with the tables stored in the string
           buffer, beyond "SvLEN()".  This eliminates the last place where the
           core stores data beyond "SvLEN()".

       o   Simplified logic in "Perl_sv_magic()" introduces a small change of
           behavior for error cases involving unknown magic types.
           Previously, if "Perl_sv_magic()" was passed a magic type unknown to
           it, it would

           1.  Croak "Modification of a read-only value attempted" if read
               only

           2.  Return without error if the SV happened to already have this
               magic

           3.  otherwise croak "Don't know how to handle magic of type \\%o"

           Now it will always croak "Don't know how to handle magic of type
           \\%o", even on read-only values, or SVs which already have the
           unknown magic type.

       o   The experimental "fetch_cop_label" function has been renamed to
           "cop_fetch_label".

       o   The "cop_store_label" function has been added to the API, but is
           experimental.

       o   embedvar.h has been simplified, and one level of macro indirection
           for PL_* variables has been removed for the default (non-
           multiplicity) configuration.  PERLVAR*() macros now directly expand
           their arguments to tokens such as "PL_defgv", instead of expanding
           to "PL_Idefgv", with embedvar.h defining a macro to map "PL_Idefgv"
           to "PL_defgv".  XS code which has unwarranted chumminess with the
           implementation may need updating.

       o   An API has been added to explicitly choose whether to export XSUB
           symbols.  More detail can be found in the comments for commit
           e64345f8.

       o   The "is_gv_magical_sv" function has been eliminated and merged with
           "gv_fetchpvn_flags".  It used to be called to determine whether a
           GV should be autovivified in rvalue context.  Now it has been
           replaced with a new "GV_ADDMG" flag (not part of the API).

       o   The returned code point from the function "utf8n_to_uvuni()" when
           the input is malformed UTF-8, malformations are allowed, and "utf8"
           warnings are off is now the Unicode REPLACEMENT CHARACTER whenever
           the malformation is such that no well-defined code point can be
           computed.  Previously the returned value was essentially garbage.
           The only malformations that have well-defined values are a zero-
           length string (0 is the return), and overlong UTF-8 sequences.

       o   Padlists are now marked "AvREAL"; i.e., reference-counted.  They
           have always been reference-counted, but were not marked real,
           because pad.c did its own clean-up, instead of using the usual
           clean-up code in sv.c.  That caused problems in thread cloning, so
           now the "AvREAL" flag is on, but is turned off in pad.c right
           before the padlist is freed (after pad.c has done its custom
           freeing of the pads).

       o   All C files that make up the Perl core have been converted to
           UTF-8.

       o   These new functions have been added as part of the work on Unicode
           symbols:

               HvNAMELEN
               HvNAMEUTF8
               HvENAMELEN
               HvENAMEUTF8
               gv_init_pv
               gv_init_pvn
               gv_init_pvsv
               gv_fetchmeth_pv
               gv_fetchmeth_pvn
               gv_fetchmeth_sv
               gv_fetchmeth_pv_autoload
               gv_fetchmeth_pvn_autoload
               gv_fetchmeth_sv_autoload
               gv_fetchmethod_pv_flags
               gv_fetchmethod_pvn_flags
               gv_fetchmethod_sv_flags
               gv_autoload_pv
               gv_autoload_pvn
               gv_autoload_sv
               newGVgen_flags
               sv_derived_from_pv
               sv_derived_from_pvn
               sv_derived_from_sv
               sv_does_pv
               sv_does_pvn
               sv_does_sv
               whichsig_pv
               whichsig_pvn
               whichsig_sv
               newCONSTSUB_flags

           The gv_fetchmethod_*_flags functions, like gv_fetchmethod_flags,
           are experimental and may change in a future release.

       o   The following functions were added.  These are not part of the API:

               GvNAMEUTF8
               GvENAMELEN
               GvENAME_HEK
               CopSTASH_flags
               CopSTASH_flags_set
               PmopSTASH_flags
               PmopSTASH_flags_set
               sv_sethek
               HEKfARG

           There is also a "HEKf" macro corresponding to "SVf", for
           interpolating HEKs in formatted strings.

       o   "sv_catpvn_flags" takes a couple of new internal-only flags,
           "SV_CATBYTES" and "SV_CATUTF8", which tell it whether the char
           array to be concatenated is UTF8.  This allows for more efficient
           concatenation than creating temporary SVs to pass to "sv_catsv".

       o   For XS AUTOLOAD subs, $AUTOLOAD is set once more, as it was in
           5.6.0.  This is in addition to setting "SvPVX(cv)", for
           compatibility with 5.8 to 5.14.  See "Autoloading with XSUBs" in
           perlguts.

       o   Perl now checks whether the array (the linearized isa) returned by
           a MRO plugin begins with the name of the class itself, for which
           the array was created, instead of assuming that it does.  This
           prevents the first element from being skipped during method lookup.
           It also means that "mro::get_linear_isa" may return an array with
           one more element than the MRO plugin provided [perl #94306].

       o   "PL_curstash" is now reference-counted.

       o   There are now feature bundle hints in "PL_hints" ($^H) that version
           declarations use, to avoid having to load feature.pm.  One setting
           of the hint bits indicates a "custom" feature bundle, which means
           that the entries in "%^H" still apply.  feature.pm uses that.

           The "HINT_FEATURE_MASK" macro is defined in perl.h along with other
           hints.  Other macros for setting and testing features and bundles
           are in the new feature.h.  "FEATURE_IS_ENABLED" (which has moved to
           feature.h) is no longer used throughout the codebase, but more
           specific macros, e.g., "FEATURE_SAY_IS_ENABLED", that are defined
           in feature.h.

       o   lib/feature.pm is now a generated file, created by the new
           regen/feature.pl script, which also generates feature.h.

       o   Tied arrays are now always "AvREAL".  If @_ or "DB::args" is tied,
           it is reified first, to make sure this is always the case.

       o   Two new functions "utf8_to_uvchr_buf()" and "utf8_to_uvuni_buf()"
           have been added.  These are the same as "utf8_to_uvchr" and
           "utf8_to_uvuni" (which are now deprecated), but take an extra
           parameter that is used to guard against reading beyond the end of
           the input string.  See "utf8_to_uvchr_buf" in perlapi and
           "utf8_to_uvuni_buf" in perlapi.

       o   The regular expression engine now does TRIE case insensitive
           matches under Unicode. This may change the output of "use re
           'debug';", and will speed up various things.

       o   There is a new "wrap_op_checker()" function, which provides a
           thread-safe alternative to writing to "PL_check" directly.

Selected Bug Fixes
   Array and hash
       o   A bug has been fixed that would cause a "Use of freed value in
           iteration" error if the next two hash elements that would be
           iterated over are deleted [perl #85026]. (5.14.1)

       o   Deleting the current hash iterator (the hash element that would be
           returned by the next call to "each") in void context used not to
           free it [perl #85026].

       o   Deletion of methods via "delete $Class::{method}" syntax used to
           update method caches if called in void context, but not scalar or
           list context.

       o   When hash elements are deleted in void context, the internal hash
           entry is now freed before the value is freed, to prevent
           destructors called by that latter freeing from seeing the hash in
           an inconsistent state.  It was possible to cause double-frees if
           the destructor freed the hash itself [perl #100340].

       o   A "keys" optimization in Perl 5.12.0 to make it faster on empty
           hashes caused "each" not to reset the iterator if called after the
           last element was deleted.

       o   Freeing deeply nested hashes no longer crashes [perl #44225].

       o   It is possible from XS code to create hashes with elements that
           have no values.  The hash element and slice operators used to crash
           when handling these in lvalue context.  They now produce a
           "Modification of non-creatable hash value attempted" error message.

       o   If list assignment to a hash or array triggered destructors that
           freed the hash or array itself, a crash would ensue.  This is no
           longer the case [perl #107440].

       o   It used to be possible to free the typeglob of a localized array or
           hash (e.g., "local @{"x"}; delete $::{x}"), resulting in a crash on
           scope exit.

       o   Some core bugs affecting Hash::Util have been fixed: locking a hash
           element that is a glob copy no longer causes the next assignment to
           it to corrupt the glob (5.14.2), and unlocking a hash element that
           holds a copy-on-write scalar no longer causes modifications to that
           scalar to modify other scalars that were sharing the same string
           buffer.

   C API fixes
       o   The "newHVhv" XS function now works on tied hashes, instead of
           crashing or returning an empty hash.

       o   The "SvIsCOW" C macro now returns false for read-only copies of
           typeglobs, such as those created by:

             $hash{elem} = *foo;
             Hash::Util::lock_value %hash, 'elem';

           It used to return true.

       o   The "SvPVutf8" C function no longer tries to modify its argument,
           resulting in errors [perl #108994].

       o   "SvPVutf8" now works properly with magical variables.

       o   "SvPVbyte" now works properly non-PVs.

       o   When presented with malformed UTF-8 input, the XS-callable
           functions "is_utf8_string()", "is_utf8_string_loc()", and
           "is_utf8_string_loclen()" could read beyond the end of the input
           string by up to 12 bytes.  This no longer happens.  [perl #32080].
           However, currently, "is_utf8_char()" still has this defect, see
           "is_utf8_char()" above.

       o   The C-level "pregcomp" function could become confused about whether
           the pattern was in UTF8 if the pattern was an overloaded, tied, or
           otherwise magical scalar [perl #101940].

   Compile-time hints
       o   Tying "%^H" no longer causes perl to crash or ignore the contents
           of "%^H" when entering a compilation scope [perl #106282].

       o   "eval $string" and "require" used not to localize "%^H" during
           compilation if it was empty at the time the "eval" call itself was
           compiled.  This could lead to scary side effects, like "use re
           "/m"" enabling other flags that the surrounding code was trying to
           enable for its caller [perl #68750].

       o   "eval $string" and "require" no longer localize hints ($^H and
           "%^H") at run time, but only during compilation of the $string or
           required file.  This makes "BEGIN { $^H{foo}=7 }" equivalent to
           "BEGIN { eval '$^H{foo}=7' }" [perl #70151].

       o   Creating a BEGIN block from XS code (via "newXS" or "newATTRSUB")
           would, on completion, make the hints of the current compiling code
           the current hints.  This could cause warnings to occur in a non-
           warning scope.

   Copy-on-write scalars
       Copy-on-write or shared hash key scalars were introduced in 5.8.0, but
       most Perl code did not encounter them (they were used mostly
       internally).  Perl 5.10.0 extended them, such that assigning
       "__PACKAGE__" or a hash key to a scalar would make it copy-on-write.
       Several parts of Perl were not updated to account for them, but have
       now been fixed.

       o   "utf8::decode" had a nasty bug that would modify copy-on-write
           scalars' string buffers in place (i.e., skipping the copy).  This
           could result in hashes having two elements with the same key [perl
           #91834]. (5.14.2)

       o   Lvalue subroutines were not allowing COW scalars to be returned.
           This was fixed for lvalue scalar context in Perl 5.12.3 and 5.14.0,
           but list context was not fixed until this release.

       o   Elements of restricted hashes (see the fields pragma) containing
           copy-on-write values couldn't be deleted, nor could such hashes be
           cleared ("%hash = ()"). (5.14.2)

       o   Localizing a tied variable used to make it read-only if it
           contained a copy-on-write string. (5.14.2)

       o   Assigning a copy-on-write string to a stash element no longer
           causes a double free.  Regardless of this change, the results of
           such assignments are still undefined.

       o   Assigning a copy-on-write string to a tied variable no longer stops
           that variable from being tied if it happens to be a PVMG or PVLV
           internally.

       o   Doing a substitution on a tied variable returning a copy-on-write
           scalar used to cause an assertion failure or an "Attempt to free
           nonexistent shared string" warning.

       o   This one is a regression from 5.12: In 5.14.0, the bitwise
           assignment operators "|=", "^=" and "&=" started leaving the left-
           hand side undefined if it happened to be a copy-on-write string
           [perl #108480].

       o   Storable, Devel::Peek and PerlIO::scalar had similar problems.  See
           "Updated Modules and Pragmata", above.

   The debugger
       o   dumpvar.pl, and therefore the "x" command in the debugger, have
           been fixed to handle objects blessed into classes whose names
           contain "=".  The contents of such objects used not to be dumped
           [perl #101814].

       o   The "R" command for restarting a debugger session has been fixed to
           work on Windows, or any other system lacking a
           "POSIX::_SC_OPEN_MAX" constant [perl #87740].

       o   The "#line 42 foo" directive used not to update the arrays of lines
           used by the debugger if it occurred in a string eval.  This was
           partially fixed in 5.14, but it worked only for a single "#line 42
           foo" in each eval.  Now it works for multiple.

       o   When subroutine calls are intercepted by the debugger, the name of
           the subroutine or a reference to it is stored in $DB::sub, for the
           debugger to access.  Sometimes (such as "$foo = *bar; undef *bar;
           &$foo") $DB::sub would be set to a name that could not be used to
           find the subroutine, and so the debugger's attempt to call it would
           fail.  Now the check to see whether a reference is needed is more
           robust, so those problems should not happen anymore [rt.cpan.org
           #69862].

       o   Every subroutine has a filename associated with it that the
           debugger uses.  The one associated with constant subroutines used
           to be misallocated when cloned under threads.  Consequently,
           debugging threaded applications could result in memory corruption
           [perl #96126].

   Dereferencing operators
       o   "defined(${"..."})", "defined(*{"..."})", etc., used to return true
           for most, but not all built-in variables, if they had not been used
           yet.  This bug affected "${^GLOBAL_PHASE}" and "${^UTF8CACHE}",
           among others.  It also used to return false if the package name was
           given as well ("${"::!"}") [perl #97978, #97492].

       o   Perl 5.10.0 introduced a similar bug: "defined(*{"foo"})" where
           "foo" represents the name of a built-in global variable used to
           return false if the variable had never been used before, but only
           on the first call.  This, too, has been fixed.

       o   Since 5.6.0, "*{ ... }" has been inconsistent in how it treats
           undefined values.  It would die in strict mode or lvalue context
           for most undefined values, but would be treated as the empty string
           (with a warning) for the specific scalar return by "undef()"
           (&PL_sv_undef internally).  This has been corrected.  "undef()" is
           now treated like other undefined scalars, as in Perl 5.005.

   Filehandle, last-accessed
       Perl has an internal variable that stores the last filehandle to be
       accessed.  It is used by $. and by "tell" and "eof" without arguments.

       o   It used to be possible to set this internal variable to a glob copy
           and then modify that glob copy to be something other than a glob,
           and still have the last-accessed filehandle associated with the
           variable after assigning a glob to it again:

               my $foo = *STDOUT;  # $foo is a glob copy
               <$foo>;             # $foo is now the last-accessed handle
               $foo = 3;           # no longer a glob
               $foo = *STDERR;     # still the last-accessed handle

           Now the "$foo = 3" assignment unsets that internal variable, so
           there is no last-accessed filehandle, just as if "<$foo>" had never
           happened.

           This also prevents some unrelated handle from becoming the last-
           accessed handle if $foo falls out of scope and the same internal SV
           gets used for another handle [perl #97988].

       o   A regression in 5.14 caused these statements not to set that
           internal variable:

               my $fh = *STDOUT;
               tell $fh;
               eof  $fh;
               seek $fh, 0,0;
               tell     *$fh;
               eof      *$fh;
               seek     *$fh, 0,0;
               readline *$fh;

           This is now fixed, but "tell *{ *$fh }" still has the problem, and
           it is not clear how to fix it [perl #106536].

   Filetests and "stat"
       The term "filetests" refers to the operators that consist of a hyphen
       followed by a single letter: "-r", "-x", "-M", etc.  The term "stacked"
       when applied to filetests means followed by another filetest operator
       sharing the same operand, as in "-r -x -w $fooo".

       o   "stat" produces more consistent warnings.  It no longer warns for
           "_" [perl #71002] and no longer skips the warning at times for
           other unopened handles.  It no longer warns about an unopened
           handle when the operating system's "fstat" function fails.

       o   "stat" would sometimes return negative numbers for large inode
           numbers, because it was using the wrong internal C type. [perl
           #84590]

       o   "lstat" is documented to fall back to "stat" (with a warning) when
           given a filehandle.  When passed an IO reference, it was actually
           doing the equivalent of "stat _" and ignoring the handle.

       o   "-T _" with no preceding "stat" used to produce a confusing
           "uninitialized" warning, even though there is no visible
           uninitialized value to speak of.

       o   "-T", "-B", "-l" and "-t" now work when stacked with other filetest
           operators [perl #77388].

       o   In 5.14.0, filetest ops ("-r", "-x", etc.) started calling FETCH on
           a tied argument belonging to the previous argument to a list
           operator, if called with a bareword argument or no argument at all.
           This has been fixed, so "push @foo, $tied, -r" no longer calls
           FETCH on $tied.

       o   In Perl 5.6, "-l" followed by anything other than a bareword would
           treat its argument as a file name.  That was changed in 5.8 for
           glob references ("\*foo"), but not for globs themselves (*foo).
           "-l" started returning "undef" for glob references without setting
           the last stat buffer that the "_" handle uses, but only if warnings
           were turned on.  With warnings off, it was the same as 5.6.  In
           other words, it was simply buggy and inconsistent.  Now the 5.6
           behavior has been restored.

       o   "-l" followed by a bareword no longer "eats" the previous argument
           to the list operator in whose argument list it resides.  Hence,
           "print "bar", -l foo" now actually prints "bar", because "-l" on
           longer eats it.

       o   Perl keeps several internal variables to keep track of the last
           stat buffer, from which file(handle) it originated, what type it
           was, and whether the last stat succeeded.

           There were various cases where these could get out of synch,
           resulting in inconsistent or erratic behavior in edge cases (every
           mention of "-T" applies to "-B" as well):

           o   "-T HANDLE", even though it does a "stat", was not resetting
               the last stat type, so an "lstat _" following it would merrily
               return the wrong results.  Also, it was not setting the success
               status.

           o   Freeing the handle last used by "stat" or a filetest could
               result in "-T _" using an unrelated handle.

           o   "stat" with an IO reference would not reset the stat type or
               record the filehandle for "-T _" to use.

           o   Fatal warnings could cause the stat buffer not to be reset for
               a filetest operator on an unopened filehandle or "-l" on any
               handle.  Fatal warnings also stopped "-T" from setting $!.

           o   When the last stat was on an unreadable file, "-T _" is
               supposed to return "undef", leaving the last stat buffer
               unchanged.  But it was setting the stat type, causing "lstat _"
               to stop working.

           o   "-T FILENAME" was not resetting the internal stat buffers for
               unreadable files.

           These have all been fixed.

   Formats
       o   Several edge cases have been fixed with formats and "formline"; in
           particular, where the format itself is potentially variable (such
           as with ties and overloading), and where the format and data differ
           in their encoding.  In both these cases, it used to possible for
           the output to be corrupted [perl #91032].

       o   "formline" no longer converts its argument into a string in-place.
           So passing a reference to "formline" no longer destroys the
           reference [perl #79532].

       o   Assignment to $^A (the format output accumulator) now recalculates
           the number of lines output.

   "given" and "when"
       o   "given" was not scoping its implicit $_ properly, resulting in
           memory leaks or "Variable is not available" warnings [perl #94682].

       o   "given" was not calling set-magic on the implicit lexical $_ that
           it uses.  This meant, for example, that "pos" would be remembered
           from one execution of the same "given" block to the next, even if
           the input were a different variable [perl #84526].

       o   "when" blocks are now capable of returning variables declared
           inside the enclosing "given" block [perl #93548].

   The "glob" operator
       o   On OSes other than VMS, Perl's "glob" operator (and the "<...>"
           form) use File::Glob underneath.  File::Glob splits the pattern
           into words, before feeding each word to its "bsd_glob" function.

           There were several inconsistencies in the way the split was done.
           Now quotation marks (' and ") are always treated as shell-style
           word delimiters (that allow whitespace as part of a word) and
           backslashes are always preserved, unless they exist to escape
           quotation marks.  Before, those would only sometimes be the case,
           depending on whether the pattern contained whitespace.  Also,
           escaped whitespace at the end of the pattern is no longer stripped
           [perl #40470].

       o   "CORE::glob" now works as a way to call the default globbing
           function.  It used to respect overrides, despite the "CORE::"
           prefix.

       o   Under miniperl (used to configure modules when perl itself is
           built), "glob" now clears %ENV before calling csh, since the latter
           croaks on some systems if it does not like the contents of the
           LS_COLORS environment variable [perl #98662].

   Lvalue subroutines
       o   Explicit return now returns the actual argument passed to return,
           instead of copying it [perl #72724, #72706].

       o   Lvalue subroutines used to enforce lvalue syntax (i.e., whatever
           can go on the left-hand side of "=") for the last statement and the
           arguments to return.  Since lvalue subroutines are not always
           called in lvalue context, this restriction has been lifted.

       o   Lvalue subroutines are less restrictive about what values can be
           returned.  It used to croak on values returned by "shift" and
           "delete" and from other subroutines, but no longer does so [perl
           #71172].

       o   Empty lvalue subroutines ("sub :lvalue {}") used to return @_ in
           list context.  All subroutines used to do this, but regular subs
           were fixed in Perl 5.8.2.  Now lvalue subroutines have been
           likewise fixed.

       o   Autovivification now works on values returned from lvalue
           subroutines [perl #7946], as does returning "keys" in lvalue
           context.

       o   Lvalue subroutines used to copy their return values in rvalue
           context.  Not only was this a waste of CPU cycles, but it also
           caused bugs.  A "($)" prototype would cause an lvalue sub to copy
           its return value [perl #51408], and "while(lvalue_sub() =~ m/.../g)
           { ... }" would loop endlessly [perl #78680].

       o   When called in potential lvalue context (e.g., subroutine arguments
           or a list passed to "for"), lvalue subroutines used to copy any
           read-only value that was returned.  E.g., " sub :lvalue { $] } "
           would not return $], but a copy of it.

       o   When called in potential lvalue context, an lvalue subroutine
           returning arrays or hashes used to bind the arrays or hashes to
           scalar variables, resulting in bugs.  This was fixed in 5.14.0 if
           an array were the first thing returned from the subroutine (but not
           for "$scalar, @array" or hashes being returned).  Now a more
           general fix has been applied [perl #23790].

       o   Method calls whose arguments were all surrounded with "my()" or
           "our()" (as in "$object->method(my($a,$b))") used to force lvalue
           context on the subroutine.  This would prevent lvalue methods from
           returning certain values.

       o   Lvalue sub calls that are not determined to be such at compile time
           (&$name or &{"name"}) are no longer exempt from strict refs if they
           occur in the last statement of an lvalue subroutine [perl #102486].

       o   Sub calls whose subs are not visible at compile time, if they
           occurred in the last statement of an lvalue subroutine, would
           reject non-lvalue subroutines and die with "Can't modify non-lvalue
           subroutine call" [perl #102486].

           Non-lvalue sub calls whose subs are visible at compile time
           exhibited the opposite bug.  If the call occurred in the last
           statement of an lvalue subroutine, there would be no error when the
           lvalue sub was called in lvalue context.  Perl would blindly assign
           to the temporary value returned by the non-lvalue subroutine.

       o   "AUTOLOAD" routines used to take precedence over the actual sub
           being called (i.e., when autoloading wasn't needed), for sub calls
           in lvalue or potential lvalue context, if the subroutine was not
           visible at compile time.

       o   Applying the ":lvalue" attribute to an XSUB or to an aliased
           subroutine stub with "sub foo :lvalue;" syntax stopped working in
           Perl 5.12.  This has been fixed.

       o   Applying the :lvalue attribute to subroutine that is already
           defined does not work properly, as the attribute changes the way
           the sub is compiled.  Hence, Perl 5.12 began warning when an
           attempt is made to apply the attribute to an already defined sub.
           In such cases, the attribute is discarded.

           But the change in 5.12 missed the case where custom attributes are
           also present: that case still silently and ineffectively applied
           the attribute.  That omission has now been corrected.  "sub foo
           :lvalue :Whatever" (when "foo" is already defined) now warns about
           the :lvalue attribute, and does not apply it.

       o   A bug affecting lvalue context propagation through nested lvalue
           subroutine calls has been fixed.  Previously, returning a value in
           nested rvalue context would be treated as lvalue context by the
           inner subroutine call, resulting in some values (such as read-only
           values) being rejected.

   Overloading
       o   Arithmetic assignment ("$left += $right") involving overloaded
           objects that rely on the 'nomethod' override no longer segfault
           when the left operand is not overloaded.

       o   Errors that occur when methods cannot be found during overloading
           now mention the correct package name, as they did in 5.8.x, instead
           of erroneously mentioning the "overload" package, as they have
           since 5.10.0.

       o   Undefining %overload:: no longer causes a crash.

   Prototypes of built-in keywords
       o   The "prototype" function no longer dies for the "__FILE__",
           "__LINE__" and "__PACKAGE__" directives.  It now returns an empty-
           string prototype for them, because they are syntactically
           indistinguishable from nullary functions like "time".

       o   "prototype" now returns "undef" for all overridable infix
           operators, such as "eq", which are not callable in any way
           resembling functions.  It used to return incorrect prototypes for
           some and die for others [perl #94984].

       o   The prototypes of several built-in functions--"getprotobynumber",
           "lock", "not" and "select"--have been corrected, or at least are
           now closer to reality than before.

   Regular expressions
       o   "/[[:ascii:]]/" and "/[[:blank:]]/" now use locale rules under "use
           locale" when the platform supports that.  Previously, they used the
           platform's native character set.

       o   "m/[[:ascii:]]/i" and "/\p{ASCII}/i" now match identically (when
           not under a differing locale).  This fixes a regression introduced
           in 5.14 in which the first expression could match characters
           outside of ASCII, such as the KELVIN SIGN.

       o   "/.*/g" would sometimes refuse to match at the end of a string that
           ends with "\n".  This has been fixed [perl #109206].

       o   Starting with 5.12.0, Perl used to get its internal bookkeeping
           muddled up after assigning "${ qr// }" to a hash element and
           locking it with Hash::Util.  This could result in double frees,
           crashes, or erratic behavior.

       o   The new (in 5.14.0) regular expression modifier "/a" when repeated
           like "/aa" forbids the characters outside the ASCII range that
           match characters inside that range from matching under "/i".  This
           did not work under some circumstances, all involving alternation,
           such as:

            "\N{KELVIN SIGN}" =~ /k|foo/iaa;

           succeeded inappropriately.  This is now fixed.

       o   5.14.0 introduced some memory leaks in regular expression character
           classes such as "[\w\s]", which have now been fixed. (5.14.1)

       o   An edge case in regular expression matching could potentially loop.
           This happened only under "/i" in bracketed character classes that
           have characters with multi-character folds, and the target string
           to match against includes the first portion of the fold, followed
           by another character that has a multi-character fold that begins
           with the remaining portion of the fold, plus some more.

            "s\N{U+DF}" =~ /[\x{DF}foo]/i

           is one such case.  "\xDF" folds to "ss". (5.14.1)

       o   A few characters in regular expression pattern matches did not
           match correctly in some circumstances, all involving "/i".  The
           affected characters are: COMBINING GREEK YPOGEGRAMMENI, GREEK
           CAPITAL LETTER IOTA, GREEK CAPITAL LETTER UPSILON, GREEK
           PROSGEGRAMMENI, GREEK SMALL LETTER IOTA WITH DIALYTIKA AND OXIA,
           GREEK SMALL LETTER IOTA WITH DIALYTIKA AND TONOS, GREEK SMALL
           LETTER UPSILON WITH DIALYTIKA AND OXIA, GREEK SMALL LETTER UPSILON
           WITH DIALYTIKA AND TONOS, LATIN SMALL LETTER LONG S, LATIN SMALL
           LIGATURE LONG S T, and LATIN SMALL LIGATURE ST.

       o   A memory leak regression in regular expression compilation under
           threading has been fixed.

       o   A regression introduced in 5.14.0 has been fixed.  This involved an
           inverted bracketed character class in a regular expression that
           consisted solely of a Unicode property.  That property wasn't
           getting inverted outside the Latin1 range.

       o   Three problematic Unicode characters now work better in regex
           pattern matching under "/i".

           In the past, three Unicode characters: LATIN SMALL LETTER SHARP S,
           GREEK SMALL LETTER IOTA WITH DIALYTIKA AND TONOS, and GREEK SMALL
           LETTER UPSILON WITH DIALYTIKA AND TONOS, along with the sequences
           that they fold to (including "ss" for LATIN SMALL LETTER SHARP S),
           did not properly match under "/i".  5.14.0 fixed some of these
           cases, but introduced others, including a panic when one of the
           characters or sequences was used in the "(?(DEFINE)" regular
           expression predicate.  The known bugs that were introduced in 5.14
           have now been fixed; as well as some other edge cases that have
           never worked until now.  These all involve using the characters and
           sequences outside bracketed character classes under "/i".  This
           closes [perl #98546].

           There remain known problems when using certain characters with
           multi-character folds inside bracketed character classes, including
           such constructs as "qr/[\N{LATIN SMALL LETTER SHARP}a-z]/i".  These
           remaining bugs are addressed in [perl #89774].

       o   RT #78266: The regex engine has been leaking memory when accessing
           named captures that weren't matched as part of a regex ever since
           5.10 when they were introduced; e.g., this would consume over a
           hundred MB of memory:

               for (1..10_000_000) {
                   if ("foo" =~ /(foo|(?<capture>bar))?/) {
                       my $capture = $+{capture}
                   }
               }
               system "ps -o rss $$"'

       o   In 5.14, "/[[:lower:]]/i" and "/[[:upper:]]/i" no longer matched
           the opposite case.  This has been fixed [perl #101970].

       o   A regular expression match with an overloaded object on the right-
           hand side would sometimes stringify the object too many times.

       o   A regression has been fixed that was introduced in 5.14, in "/i"
           regular expression matching, in which a match improperly fails if
           the pattern is in UTF-8, the target string is not, and a Latin-1
           character precedes a character in the string that should match the
           pattern.  [perl #101710]

       o   In case-insensitive regular expression pattern matching, no longer
           on UTF-8 encoded strings does the scan for the start of match look
           only at the first possible position.  This caused matches such as
           ""f\x{FB00}" =~ /ff/i" to fail.

       o   The regexp optimizer no longer crashes on debugging builds when
           merging fixed-string nodes with inconvenient contents.

       o   A panic involving the combination of the regular expression
           modifiers "/aa" and the "\b" escape sequence introduced in 5.14.0
           has been fixed [perl #95964]. (5.14.2)

       o   The combination of the regular expression modifiers "/aa" and the
           "\b" and "\B" escape sequences did not work properly on UTF-8
           encoded strings.  All non-ASCII characters under "/aa" should be
           treated as non-word characters, but what was happening was that
           Unicode rules were used to determine wordness/non-wordness for non-
           ASCII characters.  This is now fixed [perl #95968].

       o   "(?foo: ...)" no longer loses passed in character set.

       o   The trie optimization used to have problems with alternations
           containing an empty "(?:)", causing ""x" =~
           /\A(?>(?:(?:)A|B|C?x))\z/" not to match, whereas it should [perl
           #111842].

       o   Use of lexical ("my") variables in code blocks embedded in regular
           expressions will no longer result in memory corruption or crashes.

           Nevertheless, these code blocks are still experimental, as there
           are still problems with the wrong variables being closed over (in
           loops for instance) and with abnormal exiting (e.g., "die") causing
           memory corruption.

       o   The "\h", "\H", "\v" and "\V" regular expression metacharacters
           used to cause a panic error message when trying to match at the end
           of the string [perl #96354].

       o   The abbreviations for four C1 control characters "MW" "PM", "RI",
           and "ST" were previously unrecognized by "\N{}", vianame(), and
           string_vianame().

       o   Mentioning a variable named "&" other than $& (i.e., "@&" or "%&")
           no longer stops $& from working.  The same applies to variables
           named "'" and "`" [perl #24237].

       o   Creating a "UNIVERSAL::AUTOLOAD" sub no longer stops "%+", "%-" and
           "%!" from working some of the time [perl #105024].

   Smartmatching
       o   "~~" now correctly handles the precedence of Any~~Object, and is
           not tricked by an overloaded object on the left-hand side.

       o   In Perl 5.14.0, "$tainted ~~ @array" stopped working properly.
           Sometimes it would erroneously fail (when $tainted contained a
           string that occurs in the array after the first element) or
           erroneously succeed (when "undef" occurred after the first element)
           [perl #93590].

   The "sort" operator
       o   "sort" was not treating "sub {}" and "sub {()}" as equivalent when
           such a sub was provided as the comparison routine.  It used to
           croak on "sub {()}".

       o   "sort" now works once more with custom sort routines that are
           XSUBs.  It stopped working in 5.10.0.

       o   "sort" with a constant for a custom sort routine, although it
           produces unsorted results, no longer crashes.  It started crashing
           in 5.10.0.

       o   Warnings emitted by "sort" when a custom comparison routine returns
           a non-numeric value now contain "in sort" and show the line number
           of the "sort" operator, rather than the last line of the comparison
           routine.  The warnings also now occur only if warnings are enabled
           in the scope where "sort" occurs.  Previously the warnings would
           occur if enabled in the comparison routine's scope.

       o   "sort { $a <=> $b }", which is optimized internally, now produces
           "uninitialized" warnings for NaNs (not-a-number values), since
           "<=>" returns "undef" for those.  This brings it in line with
           "sort { 1; $a <=> $b }" and other more complex cases, which are not
           optimized [perl #94390].

   The "substr" operator
       o   Tied (and otherwise magical) variables are no longer exempt from
           the "Attempt to use reference as lvalue in substr" warning.

       o   That warning now occurs when the returned lvalue is assigned to,
           not when "substr" itself is called.  This makes a difference only
           if the return value of "substr" is referenced and later assigned
           to.

       o   Passing a substring of a read-only value or a typeglob to a
           function (potential lvalue context) no longer causes an immediate
           "Can't coerce" or "Modification of a read-only value" error.  That
           error occurs only if the passed value is assigned to.

           The same thing happens with the "substr outside of string" error.
           If the lvalue is only read from, not written to, it is now just a
           warning, as with rvalue "substr".

       o   "substr" assignments no longer call FETCH twice if the first
           argument is a tied variable, just once.

   Support for embedded nulls
       Some parts of Perl did not work correctly with nulls ("chr 0") embedded
       in strings.  That meant that, for instance, "$m = "a\0b"; foo->$m"
       would call the "a" method, instead of the actual method name contained
       in $m.  These parts of perl have been fixed to support nulls:

       o   Method names

       o   Typeglob names (including filehandle and subroutine names)

       o   Package names, including the return value of "ref()"

       o   Typeglob elements (*foo{"THING\0stuff"})

       o   Signal names

       o   Various warnings and error messages that mention variable names or
           values, methods, etc.

       One side effect of these changes is that blessing into "\0" no longer
       causes "ref()" to return false.

   Threading bugs
       o   Typeglobs returned from threads are no longer cloned if the parent
           thread already has a glob with the same name.  This means that
           returned subroutines will now assign to the right package variables
           [perl #107366].

       o   Some cases of threads crashing due to memory allocation during
           cloning have been fixed [perl #90006].

       o   Thread joining would sometimes emit "Attempt to free unreferenced
           scalar" warnings if "caller" had been used from the "DB" package
           before thread creation [perl #98092].

       o   Locking a subroutine (via "lock &sub") is no longer a compile-time
           error for regular subs.  For lvalue subroutines, it no longer tries
           to return the sub as a scalar, resulting in strange side effects
           like "ref \$_" returning "CODE" in some instances.

           "lock &sub" is now a run-time error if threads::shared is loaded (a
           no-op otherwise), but that may be rectified in a future version.

   Tied variables
       o   Various cases in which FETCH was being ignored or called too many
           times have been fixed:

           o   "PerlIO::get_layers" [perl #97956]

           o   "$tied =~ y/a/b/", "chop $tied" and "chomp $tied" when $tied
               holds a reference.

           o   When calling "local $_" [perl #105912]

           o   Four-argument "select"

           o   A tied buffer passed to "sysread"

           o   "$tied .= <>"

           o   Three-argument "open", the third being a tied file handle (as
               in "open $fh, ">&", $tied")

           o   "sort" with a reference to a tied glob for the comparison
               routine.

           o   ".." and "..." in list context [perl #53554].

           o   "${$tied}", "@{$tied}", "%{$tied}" and "*{$tied}" where the
               tied variable returns a string ("&{}" was unaffected)

           o   "defined ${ $tied_variable }"

           o   Various functions that take a filehandle argument in rvalue
               context ("close", "readline", etc.) [perl #97482]

           o   Some cases of dereferencing a complex expression, such as "${
               (), $tied } = 1", used to call "FETCH" multiple times, but now
               call it once.

           o   "$tied->method" where $tied returns a package name--even
               resulting in a failure to call the method, due to memory
               corruption

           o   Assignments like "*$tied = \&{"..."}" and "*glob = $tied"

           o   "chdir", "chmod", "chown", "utime", "truncate", "stat", "lstat"
               and the filetest ops ("-r", "-x", etc.)

       o   "caller" sets @DB::args to the subroutine arguments when called
           from the DB package.  It used to crash when doing so if @DB::args
           happened to be tied.  Now it croaks instead.

       o   Tying an element of %ENV or "%^H" and then deleting that element
           would result in a call to the tie object's DELETE method, even
           though tying the element itself is supposed to be equivalent to
           tying a scalar (the element is, of course, a scalar) [perl #67490].

       o   When Perl autovivifies an element of a tied array or hash (which
           entails calling STORE with a new reference), it now calls FETCH
           immediately after the STORE, instead of assuming that FETCH would
           have returned the same reference.  This can make it easier to
           implement tied objects [perl #35865, #43011].

       o   Four-argument "select" no longer produces its "Non-string passed as
           bitmask" warning on tied or tainted variables that are strings.

       o   Localizing a tied scalar that returns a typeglob no longer stops it
           from being tied till the end of the scope.

       o   Attempting to "goto" out of a tied handle method used to cause
           memory corruption or crashes.  Now it produces an error message
           instead [perl #8611].

       o   A bug has been fixed that occurs when a tied variable is used as a
           subroutine reference:  if the last thing assigned to or returned
           from the variable was a reference or typeglob, the "\&$tied" could
           either crash or return the wrong subroutine.  The reference case is
           a regression introduced in Perl 5.10.0.  For typeglobs, it has
           probably never worked till now.

   Version objects and vstrings
       o   The bitwise complement operator (and possibly other operators, too)
           when passed a vstring would leave vstring magic attached to the
           return value, even though the string had changed.  This meant that
           "version->new(~v1.2.3)" would create a version looking like
           "v1.2.3" even though the string passed to "version->new" was
           actually "\376\375\374".  This also caused B::Deparse to deparse
           "~v1.2.3" incorrectly, without the "~" [perl #29070].

       o   Assigning a vstring to a magic (e.g., tied, $!) variable and then
           assigning something else used to blow away all magic.  This meant
           that tied variables would come undone, $! would stop getting
           updated on failed system calls, $| would stop setting autoflush,
           and other mischief would take place.  This has been fixed.

       o   "version->new("version")" and "printf "%vd", "version"" no longer
           crash [perl #102586].

       o   Version comparisons, such as those that happen implicitly with "use
           v5.43", no longer cause locale settings to change [perl #105784].

       o   Version objects no longer cause memory leaks in boolean context
           [perl #109762].

   Warnings, redefinition
       o   Subroutines from the "autouse" namespace are once more exempt from
           redefinition warnings.  This used to work in 5.005, but was broken
           in 5.6 for most subroutines.  For subs created via XS that redefine
           subroutines from the "autouse" package, this stopped working in
           5.10.

       o   New XSUBs now produce redefinition warnings if they overwrite
           existing subs, as they did in 5.8.x.  (The "autouse" logic was
           reversed in 5.10-14.  Only subroutines from the "autouse" namespace
           would warn when clobbered.)

       o   "newCONSTSUB" used to use compile-time warning hints, instead of
           run-time hints.  The following code should never produce a
           redefinition warning, but it used to, if "newCONSTSUB" redefined an
           existing subroutine:

               use warnings;
               BEGIN {
                   no warnings;
                   some_XS_function_that_calls_new_CONSTSUB();
               }

       o   Redefinition warnings for constant subroutines are on by default
           (what are known as severe warnings in perldiag).  This occurred
           only when it was a glob assignment or declaration of a Perl
           subroutine that caused the warning.  If the creation of XSUBs
           triggered the warning, it was not a default warning.  This has been
           corrected.

       o   The internal check to see whether a redefinition warning should
           occur used to emit "uninitialized" warnings in cases like this:

               use warnings "uninitialized";
               use constant {u => undef, v => undef};
               sub foo(){u}
               sub foo(){v}

   Warnings, "Uninitialized"
       o   Various functions that take a filehandle argument in rvalue context
           ("close", "readline", etc.) used to warn twice for an undefined
           handle [perl #97482].

       o   "dbmopen" now only warns once, rather than three times, if the mode
           argument is "undef" [perl #90064].

       o   The "+=" operator does not usually warn when the left-hand side is
           "undef", but it was doing so for tied variables.  This has been
           fixed [perl #44895].

       o   A bug fix in Perl 5.14 introduced a new bug, causing
           "uninitialized" warnings to report the wrong variable if the
           operator in question had two operands and one was "%{...}" or
           "@{...}".  This has been fixed [perl #103766].

       o   ".." and "..." in list context now mention the name of the variable
           in "uninitialized" warnings for string (as opposed to numeric)
           ranges.

   Weak references
       o   Weakening the first argument to an automatically-invoked "DESTROY"
           method could result in erroneous "DESTROY created new reference"
           errors or crashes.  Now it is an error to weaken a read-only
           reference.

       o   Weak references to lexical hashes going out of scope were not going
           stale (becoming undefined), but continued to point to the hash.

       o   Weak references to lexical variables going out of scope are now
           broken before any magical methods (e.g., DESTROY on a tie object)
           are called.  This prevents such methods from modifying the variable
           that will be seen the next time the scope is entered.

       o   Creating a weak reference to an @ISA array or accessing the array
           index ($#ISA) could result in confused internal bookkeeping for
           elements later added to the @ISA array.  For instance, creating a
           weak reference to the element itself could push that weak reference
           on to @ISA; and elements added after use of $#ISA would be ignored
           by method lookup [perl #85670].

   Other notable fixes
       o   "quotemeta" now quotes consistently the same non-ASCII characters
           under "use feature 'unicode_strings'", regardless of whether the
           string is encoded in UTF-8 or not, hence fixing the last vestiges
           (we hope) of the notorious "The "Unicode Bug"" in perlunicode.
           [perl #77654].

           Which of these code points is quoted has changed, based on
           Unicode's recommendations.  See "quotemeta" in perlfunc for
           details.

       o   "study" is now a no-op, presumably fixing all outstanding bugs
           related to study causing regex matches to behave incorrectly!

       o   When one writes "open foo || die", which used to work in Perl 4, a
           "Precedence problem" warning is produced.  This warning used
           erroneously to apply to fully-qualified bareword handle names not
           followed by "||".  This has been corrected.

       o   After package aliasing ("*foo:: = *bar::"), "select" with 0 or 1
           argument would sometimes return a name that could not be used to
           refer to the filehandle, or sometimes it would return "undef" even
           when a filehandle was selected.  Now it returns a typeglob
           reference in such cases.

       o   "PerlIO::get_layers" no longer ignores some arguments that it
           thinks are numeric, while treating others as filehandle names.  It
           is now consistent for flat scalars (i.e., not references).

       o   Unrecognized switches on "#!" line

           If a switch, such as -x, that cannot occur on the "#!" line is used
           there, perl dies with "Can't emulate...".

           It used to produce the same message for switches that perl did not
           recognize at all, whether on the command line or the "#!" line.

           Now it produces the "Unrecognized switch" error message [perl
           #104288].

       o   "system" now temporarily blocks the SIGCHLD signal handler, to
           prevent the signal handler from stealing the exit status [perl
           #105700].

       o   The %n formatting code for "printf" and "sprintf", which causes the
           number of characters to be assigned to the next argument, now
           actually assigns the number of characters, instead of the number of
           bytes.

           It also works now with special lvalue functions like "substr" and
           with nonexistent hash and array elements [perl #3471, #103492].

       o   Perl skips copying values returned from a subroutine, for the sake
           of speed, if doing so would make no observable difference.  Because
           of faulty logic, this would happen with the result of "delete",
           "shift" or "splice", even if the result was referenced elsewhere.
           It also did so with tied variables about to be freed [perl #91844,
           #95548].

       o   "utf8::decode" now refuses to modify read-only scalars [perl
           #91850].

       o   Freeing $_ inside a "grep" or "map" block, a code block embedded in
           a regular expression, or an @INC filter (a subroutine returned by a
           subroutine in @INC) used to result in double frees or crashes [perl
           #91880, #92254, #92256].

       o   "eval" returns "undef" in scalar context or an empty list in list
           context when there is a run-time error.  When "eval" was passed a
           string in list context and a syntax error occurred, it used to
           return a list containing a single undefined element.  Now it
           returns an empty list in list context for all errors [perl #80630].

       o   "goto &func" no longer crashes, but produces an error message, when
           the unwinding of the current subroutine's scope fires a destructor
           that undefines the subroutine being "goneto" [perl #99850].

       o   Perl now holds an extra reference count on the package that code is
           currently compiling in.  This means that the following code no
           longer crashes [perl #101486]:

               package Foo;
               BEGIN {*Foo:: = *Bar::}
               sub foo;

       o   The "x" repetition operator no longer crashes on 64-bit builds with
           large repeat counts [perl #94560].

       o   Calling "require" on an implicit $_ when *CORE::GLOBAL::require has
           been overridden does not segfault anymore, and $_ is now passed to
           the overriding subroutine [perl #78260].

       o   "use" and "require" are no longer affected by the I/O layers active
           in the caller's scope (enabled by open.pm) [perl #96008].

       o   "our $::e; $e" (which is invalid) no longer produces the
           "Compilation error at lib/utf8_heavy.pl..." error message, which it
           started emitting in 5.10.0 [perl #99984].

       o   On 64-bit systems, "read()" now understands large string offsets
           beyond the 32-bit range.

       o   Errors that occur when processing subroutine attributes no longer
           cause the subroutine's op tree to leak.

       o   Passing the same constant subroutine to both "index" and "formline"
           no longer causes one or the other to fail [perl #89218]. (5.14.1)

       o   List assignment to lexical variables declared with attributes in
           the same statement ("my ($x,@y) : blimp = (72,94)") stopped working
           in Perl 5.8.0.  It has now been fixed.

       o   Perl 5.10.0 introduced some faulty logic that made "U*" in the
           middle of a pack template equivalent to "U0" if the input string
           was empty.  This has been fixed [perl #90160]. (5.14.2)

       o   Destructors on objects were not called during global destruction on
           objects that were not referenced by any scalars.  This could happen
           if an array element were blessed (e.g., "bless \$a[0]") or if a
           closure referenced a blessed variable ("bless \my @a; sub foo { @a
           }").

           Now there is an extra pass during global destruction to fire
           destructors on any objects that might be left after the usual
           passes that check for objects referenced by scalars [perl #36347].

       o   Fixed a case where it was possible that a freed buffer may have
           been read from when parsing a here document [perl #90128]. (5.14.1)

       o   "each(ARRAY)" is now wrapped in "defined(...)", like "each(HASH)",
           inside a "while" condition [perl #90888].

       o   A problem with context propagation when a "do" block is an argument
           to "return" has been fixed.  It used to cause "undef" to be
           returned in certain cases of a "return" inside an "if" block which
           itself is followed by another "return".

       o   Calling "index" with a tainted constant no longer causes constants
           in subsequently compiled code to become tainted [perl #64804].

       o   Infinite loops like "1 while 1" used to stop "strict 'subs'" mode
           from working for the rest of the block.

       o   For list assignments like "($a,$b) = ($b,$a)", Perl has to make a
           copy of the items on the right-hand side before assignment them to
           the left.  For efficiency's sake, it assigns the values on the
           right straight to the items on the left if no one variable is
           mentioned on both sides, as in "($a,$b) = ($c,$d)".  The logic for
           determining when it can cheat was faulty, in that "&&" and "||" on
           the right-hand side could fool it.  So "($a,$b) = $some_true_value
           && ($b,$a)" would end up assigning the value of $b to both scalars.

       o   Perl no longer tries to apply lvalue context to the string in
           "("string", $variable) ||= 1" (which used to be an error).  Since
           the left-hand side of "||=" is evaluated in scalar context, that's
           a scalar comma operator, which gives all but the last item void
           context.  There is no such thing as void lvalue context, so it was
           a mistake for Perl to try to force it [perl #96942].

       o   "caller" no longer leaks memory when called from the DB package if
           @DB::args was assigned to after the first call to "caller".  Carp
           was triggering this bug [perl #97010]. (5.14.2)

       o   "close" and similar filehandle functions, when called on built-in
           global variables (like $+), used to die if the variable happened to
           hold the undefined value, instead of producing the usual "Use of
           uninitialized value" warning.

       o   When autovivified file handles were introduced in Perl 5.6.0,
           "readline" was inadvertently made to autovivify when called as
           "readline($foo)" (but not as "<$foo>").  It has now been fixed
           never to autovivify.

       o   Calling an undefined anonymous subroutine (e.g., what $x holds
           after "undef &{$x = sub{}}") used to cause a "Not a CODE reference"
           error, which has been corrected to "Undefined subroutine called"
           [perl #71154].

       o   Causing @DB::args to be freed between uses of "caller" no longer
           results in a crash [perl #93320].

       o   "setpgrp($foo)" used to be equivalent to "($foo, setpgrp)", because
           "setpgrp" was ignoring its argument if there was just one.  Now it
           is equivalent to "setpgrp($foo,0)".

       o   "shmread" was not setting the scalar flags correctly when reading
           from shared memory, causing the existing cached numeric
           representation in the scalar to persist [perl #98480].

       o   "++" and "--" now work on copies of globs, instead of dying.

       o   "splice()" doesn't warn when truncating

           You can now limit the size of an array using "splice(@a,MAX_LEN)"
           without worrying about warnings.

       o   $$ is no longer tainted.  Since this value comes directly from
           "getpid()", it is always safe.

       o   The parser no longer leaks a filehandle if STDIN was closed before
           parsing started [perl #37033].

       o   "die;" with a non-reference, non-string, or magical (e.g., tainted)
           value in $@ now properly propagates that value [perl #111654].

Known Problems
       o   On Solaris, we have two kinds of failure.

           If make is Sun's make, we get an error about a badly formed macro
           assignment in the Makefile.  That happens when ./Configure tries to
           make depends.  Configure then exits 0, but further make-ing fails.

           If make is gmake, Configure completes, then we get errors related
           to /usr/include/stdbool.h

       o   On Win32, a number of tests hang unless STDERR is redirected.  The
           cause of this is still under investigation.

       o   When building as root with a umask that prevents files from being
           other-readable, t/op/filetest.t will fail.  This is a test bug, not
           a bug in perl's behavior.

       o   Configuring with a recent gcc and link-time-optimization, such as
           "Configure -Doptimize='-O2 -flto'" fails because the optimizer
           optimizes away some of Configure's tests.  A workaround is to omit
           the "-flto" flag when running Configure, but add it back in while
           actually building, something like

               sh Configure -Doptimize=-O2
               make OPTIMIZE='-O2 -flto'

       o   The following CPAN modules have test failures with perl 5.16.
           Patches have been submitted for all of these, so hopefully there
           will be new releases soon:

           o   Date::Pcalc version 6.1

           o   Module::CPANTS::Analyse version 0.85

               This fails due to problems in Module::Find 0.10 and
               File::MMagic 1.27.

           o   PerlIO::Util version 0.72

       The list above is almost certainly incomplete as it is automatically
       generated from version control history.  In particular, it does not
       include the names of the (very much appreciated) contributors who
       reported issues to the Perl bug tracker.

       Many of the changes included in this version originated in the CPAN
       modules included in Perl's core.  We're grateful to the entire CPAN
       community for helping Perl to flourish.

Reporting Bugs
       If you find what you think is a bug, you might check the articles
       recently posted to the comp.lang.perl.misc newsgroup and the perl bug
       database at <http://rt.perl.org/perlbug/>.  There may also be
       information at <http://www.perl.org/>, the Perl Home Page.

       If you believe you have an unreported bug, please run the perlbug
       program included with your release.  Be sure to trim your bug down to a
       tiny but sufficient test case.  Your bug report, along with the output
       of "perl -V", will be sent off to perlbug@perl.org to be analysed by
       the Perl porting team.

       If the bug you are reporting has security implications, which make it
       inappropriate to send to a publicly archived mailing list, then please
       send it to perl5-security-report@perl.org.  This points to a closed
       subscription unarchived mailing list, which includes all core
       committers, who will be able to help assess the impact of issues,
       figure out a resolution, and help co-ordinate the release of patches to
       mitigate or fix the problem across all platforms on which Perl is
       supported.  Please use this address only for security issues in the
       Perl core, not for modules independently distributed on CPAN.
