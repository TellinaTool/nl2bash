SNMPCMD(1)                         Net-SNMP                         SNMPCMD(1)



NAME
       snmpcmd - options and behaviour common to most of the Net-SNMP command-
       line tools

SYNOPSIS
       snmpcmd [OPTIONS] AGENT [PARAMETERS]

DESCRIPTION
       This manual page describes the common options for  the  SNMP  commands:
       snmpbulkget,  snmpbulkwalk,  snmpdelta,  snmpget, snmpgetnext, snmpnet-
       stat, snmpset, snmpstatus, snmptable, snmptest, snmptrap,  snmpdf, snm-
       pusm  , snmpwalk .  The command line applications use the SNMP protocol
       to communicate with an SNMP capable network entity, an agent.  Individ-
       ual applications typically (but not necessarily) take additional param-
       eters that are given after the agent specification.   These  parameters
       are documented in the manual pages for each application.

COMMAND-LINE CONFIG OPTIONS
       In  addition  to  the options described in this manual page, all of the
       tokens described in the snmp.conf and other .conf manual pages  can  be
       used  on the command line of Net-SNMP applications as well by prefixing
       them with "--".  EG, specifying --dontLoadHostConfig=true on  the  com-
       mand  line  will  turn  of  loading  of the host specific configuration
       files.

       The snmp.conf file settings and the double-dash arguments over-ride the
       single-dash  arguments.   So it's important to note that if single-dash
       arguments aren't working because you have  settings  in  the  snmp.conf
       file  that  conflict  with them then you'll need to use the longer-form
       double-dash arguments to successfully trump  the  snmp.conf  file  set-
       tings.

Generic Options
       Thes  options  control  how  the Net-SNMP commands behave regardless of
       what version of SNMP you are using.  See further below for options that
       control specific versions or sub-modules of the SNMP protocol.

       -d     Dump (in hexadecimal) the raw SNMP packets sent and received.

       -D[TOKEN[,...]]
              Turn  on  debugging  output for the given TOKEN(s).  Try ALL for
              extremely verbose output.


       -h, --help
              Display a brief usage message and then exit.

       -H     Display a list of configuration  file  directives  under-
              stood by the command and then exit.

       -I [brRhu]
              Specifies input parsing options. See INPUT OPTIONS below.

       -L [eEfFoOsS]
              Specifies output logging  options.  See  LOGGING  OPTIONS
              below.

       -m MIBLIST
              Specifies  a  colon  separated  list  of MIB modules (not
              files) to load for this application.  This overrides  (or
              augments)  the  environment  variable MIBS, the snmp.conf
              directive mibs, and the list of MIBs hardcoded  into  the
              Net-SNMP library.

              If  MIBLIST  has a leading '-' or '+' character, then the
              MIB modules listed are loaded in addition to the  default
              list,  coming  before  or  after  this list respectively.
              Otherwise, the specified MIBs are loaded instead of  this
              default list.

              The  special  keyword ALL is used to load all MIB modules
              in the MIB directory search list.  Every file whose  name
              does  not  begin  with "." will be parsed as if it were a
              MIB file.

       -M DIRLIST
              Specifies a colon separated list of directories to search
              for  MIBs.   This overrides (or augments) the environment
              variable MIBDIRS, the snmp.conf  directive  mibdirs,  and
              the default directory hardcoded into the Net-SNMP library
              (/usr/share/snmp/mibs).

              If DIRLIST has a leading '-' or '+' character,  then  the
              given  directories  are  added to the default list, being
              searched before or after the  directories  on  this  list
              respectively.   Otherwise,  the specified directories are
              searched instead of this default list.

              Note that the directories appearing  later  in  the  list
              have have precedence over earlier ones.  To avoid search-
              ing any MIB  directories,  set  the  MIBDIRS  environment
              variable to the empty string ("").

              Note  that MIBs specified using the -m option or the mibs
              configuration directive will be loaded from  one  of  the
              directories  listed  by  the  -M option (or equivalents).
              The mibfile directive takes a full path to the  specified
              MIB  file,  so this does not need to be in the MIB direc-
              tory search list.

       -v 1 | 2c | 3
              Specifies  the  protocol  version   to   use:   1   (RFCs
              1155-1157),  2c  (RFCs 1901-1908), or 3 (RFCs 2571-2574).
              The  default  is  typically  version  3.   Overrides  the
              defVersion token in the snmp.conf file.  -O [abeEfnqQsSt-
              TuUvxX] Specifies output  printing  options.  See  OUTPUT
              OPTIONS below.

       -P [cdeRuwW]
              Specifies  MIB  parsing options.  See MIB PARSING OPTIONS
              below.

       -r retries
              Specifies the  number  of  retries  to  be  used  in  the
              requests. The default is 5.

       -t timeout
              Specifies  the  timeout  in  seconds between retries. The
              default is 1.  Floating point  numbers  can  be  used  to
              specify fractions of seconds.

       -V, --version
              Display  version information for the application and then
              exit.

       -Yname="value"

       --name="value"
              Allows to specify any token  ("name")  supported  in  the
              snmp.conf  file  and sets its value to "value". Overrides
              the  corresponding  token  in  the  snmp.conf  file.  See
              snmp.conf(5) for the full list of tokens.



SNMPv3 Options
       The  following  options  are  generic  to  all  forms of SNMPv3,
       regardless of whether it's the original SNMPv3 with USM  or  the
       newer SNMPv3 over (D)TLS support.


       -l secLevel
              Set the securityLevel used for SNMPv3 messages (noAuthNo-
              Priv|authNoPriv|authPriv).   Appropriate  pass  phrase(s)
              must  provided when using any level higher than noAuthNo-
              Priv.   Overrides  the  defSecurityLevel  token  in   the
              snmp.conf file.

       -n contextName
              Set  the  contextName  used  for  SNMPv3  messages.   The
              default contextName is the empty  string  "".   Overrides
              the defContext token in the snmp.conf file.


SNMPv3 over TLS Options
       These  options  pass  transport-specific  parameters  to the TLS
       layer.  If you're using SNMP over TLS or  DTLS  you'll  need  to
       pass  a  combination  of these either through these command line
       options or through snmp.conf configuration tokens.

       A note about <certificate-specifier>s : Net-SNMP looks for X.509
       certificates  in each of the normal SNMP configuration directory
       search paths under a "tls" subdirectory.  IE, it  will  look  in
       ~/.snmp/tls  and  in /usr/local/share/snmp/tls for certificates.
       The certificate components (eg, the public and  private  halves)
       are stored in sub-directories underneath this root set of direc-
       tories.  See the net-snmp-cert tool for help in importing,  cre-
       ating  and  managing Net-SNMP certificates.  <certificate-speci-
       fier>s can reference either a fingerprint of the certificate  to
       use (the net-snmp-cert tool can help you figure out the certifi-
       cates) or the filename's prefix can be used.   For  example,  if
       you  had  a  "snmpd.crt"  certificate file then you could simply
       refer to the certificate via the "snmpd" specifier.

       -T our_identity=<certificate-specifier>
              Indicates to the transport which key should  be  used  to
              initiate (D)TLS client connections.  This would typically
              be a certificate found using  the  application  name  (eg
              snmpd, snmptrapd, perl, python) or genericized name "snm-
              papp" if using one of the generic applications  (snmpget,
              snmpwalk,   etc).    This  can  also  be  set  using  the
              clientCert specifier in a snmp.conf configuration file.

       -T their_identity=<certificate-specifier>
              If you expect a particular certificate to be presented by
              the  other  side then you can use this specifier to indi-
              cate the certificate it should present.  If it  fails  to
              present  the  expected certificate the client will refuse
              to open the connection  (because  doing  otherwise  could
              lead to man-in-the-middle attacks).  This can also be set
              using the serverCert specifier in a snmp.conf  configura-
              tion file.

       -T trust_cert=<certificate-specifier>
              If  you  have a trusted CA certificate you wish to anchor
              trust with, you can use this flag to load  a  given  cer-
              tificate  as  a  trust anchor.  A copy of the certificate
              must exist within the Net-SNMP certificate storage system
              or this must point to a complete path name.  Also see the
              "trustCert" snmp.conf configuration token.

       -T their_hostname=<name>
              If the server's presented certificate can  be  validating
              using  a trust anchor then their hostname will be checked
              to ensure their presented hostname matches  one  that  is
              expected  (you  don't  want  to connect to goodhost.exam-
              ple.com  and  accept  a  certificate  presented  by  bad-
              host.example.com  do  you?).   This token can specify the
              exact host name expected to be presented  by  the  remote
              side,  either in a subjectAltName field or in the Common-
              Name field of the server's X.509 certificate.

SNMPv3 with USM Options
       These options are specific to using  SNMPv3  with  the  original
       User-based Security Model (USM).

       -3[MmKk]  0xHEXKEY
              Sets  the keys to be used for SNMPv3 transactions.  These
              options allow you to set the  master  authentication  and
              encryption  keys  (-3m  and  -3M respectively) or set the
              localized authentication and encryption keys (-3k and -3K
              respectively).   SNMPv3  keys  can be either passed in by
              hand using these flags, or by the use of  keys  generated
              from passwords using the -A and -X flags discussed below.
              For further details on SNMPv3 and  its  usage  of  keying
              information,   see  the  Net-SNMP  tutorial  web  site  (
              http://www.Net-SNMP.org/tutorial-5/commands/  ).    Over-
              rides the defAuthMasterKey (-3m), defPrivMasterKey (-3M),
              defAuthLocalizedKey (-3k)  or  defPrivLocalizedKey  (-3K)
              tokens,   respectively,   in   the  snmp.conf  file,  see
              snmp.conf(5).

       -a authProtocol
              Set the authentication protocol (MD5  or  SHA)  used  for
              authenticated  SNMPv3 messages. Overrides the defAuthType
              token in the snmp.conf file.

       -A authPassword
              Set the authentication pass phrase used for authenticated
              SNMPv3  messages.   Overrides the defAuthPassphrase token
              in the snmp.conf file. It is  insecure  to  specify  pass
              phrases on the command line, see snmp.conf(5).

       -e engineID
              Set the authoritative (security) engineID used for SNMPv3
              REQUEST messages, given as a hexadecimal string  (option-
              ally prefixed by "0x").  It is typically not necessary to
              specify this engine ID, as it will usually be  discovered
              automatically.

       -E engineID
              Set the context engineID used for SNMPv3 REQUEST messages
              scopedPdu, given as a hexadecimal string.  If not  speci-
              fied, this will default to the authoritative engineID.

       -u secName
              Set  the  securityName used for authenticated SNMPv3 mes-
              sages.   Overrides  the  defSecurityName  token  in   the
              snmp.conf file.

       -x privProtocol
              Set  the privacy protocol (DES or AES) used for encrypted
              SNMPv3 messages.  Overrides the defPrivType token in  the
              snmp.conf file. This option is only valid if the Net-SNMP
              software was build to use OpenSSL.

       -X privPassword
              Set the privacy pass phrase  used  for  encrypted  SNMPv3
              messages.   Overrides  the defPrivPassphrase token in the
              snmp.conf file.  It is insecure to specify  pass  phrases
              on the command line, see snmp.conf(5).

       -Z boots,time
              Set the engineBoots and engineTime used for authenticated
              SNMPv3 messages.  This will initialize the  local  notion
              of  the  agents  boots/time  with  an authenticated value
              stored in the LCD.  It  is  typically  not  necessary  to
              specify this option, as these values will usually be dis-
              covered automatically.



SNMPv1 and SNMPv2c Options
       -c community
              Set the community  string  for  SNMPv1/v2c  transactions.
              Overrides the defCommunity token in the snmp.conf file.


AGENT SPECIFICATION
       The string AGENT in the SYNOPSIS above specifies the remote SNMP
       entity with which to communicate.  This specification takes  the
       form:

              [<transport-specifier>:]<transport-address>

       At  its simplest, the AGENT specification may consist of a host-
       name, or an IPv4 address in the standard "dotted quad" notation.
       In  this case, communication will be attempted using UDP/IPv4 to
       port 161 of the given host.  Otherwise, the  <transport-address>
       part  of  the specification is parsed according to the following
       table:

           <transport-specifier>       <transport-address> format

           udp                         hostname[:port]               or
                                       IPv4-address[:port]

           tcp                         hostname[:port]               or
                                       IPv4-address[:port]

           unix                        pathname

           ipx                         [network]:node[/port]

           aal5pvc or pvc              [interface.][VPI.]VCI

           udp6 or udpv6 or udpipv6    hostname[:port]               or
                                       IPv6-address:port or
                                        '['IPv6-address']'[:port]

           tcp6 or tcpv6 or tcpipv6    hostname[:port]               or
                                       IPv6-address:port or
                                        '['IPv6-address']'[:port]

       Note that <transport-specifier> strings are case-insensitive  so
       that,  for  example,  "tcp"  and "TCP" are equivalent.  Here are
       some examples, along with their interpretation:

       hostname:161            perform query using  UDP/IPv4  datagrams
                               to  hostname on port 161.  The ":161" is
                               redundant here since that is the default
                               SNMP port in any case.

       udp:hostname            identical to the previous specification.
                               The  "udp:"  is  redundant  here   since
                               UDP/IPv4 is the default transport.

       TCP:hostname:1161       connect  to  hostname on port 1161 using
                               TCP/IPv4 and  perform  query  over  that
                               connection.  udp6:hostname:10161 perform
                               the query using  UDP/IPv6  datagrams  to
                               port  10161  on  hostname (which will be
                               looked up as an AAAA record).

       UDP6:[fe80::2d0:b7ff:fe21:c6c0]
                               perform the query using  UDP/IPv6  data-
                               grams    to    port   161   at   address
                               fe80::2d0:b7ff:fe21:c6c0.

       tcpipv6:[::1]:1611      connect to port 1611 on the  local  host
                               (::1  in  IPv6  parlance) using TCP/IPv6
                               and perform query over that  connection.

       tls:hostname:10161

       dtls:hostname:10161     Connects  using SNMP over DTLS or TLS as
                               documented by  the  ISMS  working  group
                               (RFCs  not  yet  published  as  of  this
                               date).  This will require (and automati-
                               cally  ensures)  that  the  TSM security
                               model is in use.  You'll  also  need  to
                               set  up trust paths for the certificates
                               presented by the server (see  above  for
                               descriptions of this).

       ssh:hostname:22         Connects  using  SNMP  over SSH as docu-
                               mented by the ISMS working  group  (RFCs

       /tmp/local-agent        identical to the previous specification,

                               myname udp:127.0.0.1:9161 ".   Any  type
                               of  transport  definition can be used as
                               the alias expansion parameter.   Aliases
                               are   particularly   useful   for  using
                               repeated complex transport strings.

                               ATM adapter in the machine.

                               on the permanent  virtual  circuit  with

                               the second ATM adapter in  the  machine.
                               Note   that   "PVC"  is  a  synonym  for
                               "AAL5PVC".

       Note that not all the transport domains listed above will always
       be  available; for instance, hosts with no IPv6 support will not
       be able to use udp6 transport addresses, and attempts to  do  so
       will  result  in the error "Unknown host".  Likewise, since AAL5
       PVC support is only currently available on Linux, it  will  fail
       with the same error on other platforms.

MIB PARSING OPTIONS
       The  Net-SNMP MIB parser mostly adheres to the Structure of Man-
       agement Information (SMI).  As that  specification  has  changed
       through time, and in recognition of the (ahem) diversity in com-
       pliance expressed in MIB files, additional options provide  more
       flexibility in reading MIB files.

       -Pc    Toggles  whether  ASN.1 comments should extend to the end
              of the MIB source  line.   Strictly  speaking,  a  second
              appearance of "--" should terminate the comment, but this
              breaks some MIB files.  The default behaviour (to  inter-
              pret comments correctly) can also be set with the config-
              uration token commentToEOL.

       -Pd    Disables the loading  of  MIB  object  DESCRIPTIONs  when
              parsing  MIB  files.   This  reduces the amount of memory
              used by the running application.

       -Pe    Toggles whether to show errors encountered  when  parsing
              MIB  files.  These include references to IMPORTed modules
              and MIB objects that cannot be located in the MIB  direc-
              tory  search list.  The default behaviour can also be set
              with the configuration token showMibErrors.

       -PR    If the same MIB object (parent name  and  sub-identifier)
              appears  multiple  times  in  the list of MIB definitions
              loaded, use the last version to be read in.  By  default,
              the  first  version will be used, and any duplicates dis-
              carded.  This behaviour can also be set with the configu-
              ration token mibReplaceWithLatest.

              Such  ordering is normally only relevant if there are two
              MIB files with conflicting  object  definitions  for  the
              same  OID  (or  different revisions of the same basic MIB
              object).

       -Pu    Toggles whether to allow the underline character  in  MIB
              object  names and other symbols.  Strictly speaking, this
              is not valid SMI syntax, but some vendor MIB files define
              such  names.   The default behaviour can also be set with
              the configuration token mibAllowUnderline.

       -Pw    Show various warning messages in parsing  MIB  files  and
              building the overall OID tree.  This can also be set with
              the configuration directive mibWarningLevel 1

       -PW    Show some additional warning messages, mostly relating to
              parsing  individual  MIB  objects.   This can also be set
              with the configuration directive mibWarningLevel 2


OUTPUT OPTIONS
       The format of the output from SNMP commands  can  be  controlled
       using  various  parameters of the -O flag.  The effects of these
       sub-options can be seen by comparison with the following default
       output (unless otherwise specified):
              $ snmpget -c public -v 1 localhost sysUpTime.0
              SNMPv2-MIB::sysUpTime.0 = Timeticks: (14096763) 1 day, 15:09:27.63


       -Oa    Display string values as ASCII strings (unless there is a
              DISPLAY-HINT defined for the corresponding  MIB  object).
              By default, the library attempts to determine whether the
              value is a printable or binary string,  and  displays  it
              accordingly.

              This  option  does not affect objects that do have a Dis-
              play Hint.

       -Ob    Display table indexes numerically, rather than trying  to
              interpret  the  instance  subidentifiers as string or OID
              values:
                  $ snmpgetnext -c public -v 1 localhost vacmSecurityModel
                  SNMP-VIEW-BASED-ACM-MIB::vacmSecurityModel.0."wes" = xxx
                  $ snmpgetnext -c public -v 1 -Ob localhost vacmSecurityModel
                  SNMP-VIEW-BASED-ACM-MIB::vacmSecurityModel.0.3.119.101.115 = xxx

       -Oe    Removes the symbolic labels from enumeration values:
                  $ snmpget -c public -v 1 localhost ipForwarding.0
                  IP-MIB::ipForwarding.0 = INTEGER: forwarding(1)
                  $ snmpget -c public -v 1 -Oe localhost ipForwarding.0
                  IP-MIB::ipForwarding.0 = INTEGER: 1

       -OE    Modifies index strings to escape the quote characters:
                  $ snmpgetnext -c public -v 1 localhost vacmSecurityModel
                  SNMP-VIEW-BASED-ACM-MIB::vacmSecurityModel.0."wes" = xxx
                  $ snmpgetnext -c public -v 1 -OE localhost vacmSecurityModel
                  SNMP-VIEW-BASED-ACM-MIB::vacmSecurityModel.0.\"wes\" = xxx

              This allows the output to be reused in shell commands.

       -Of    Include the full list of MIB objects when  displaying  an
              OID:
                  .iso.org.dod.internet.mgmt.mib-2.system.sysUpTime.0 =
                             Timeticks: (14096763) 1 day, 15:09:27.63

       -On    Displays the OID numerically:
                  .1.3.6.1.2.1.1.3.0 =  Timeticks:  (14096763)  1  day,
              15:09:27.63

       -Oq    Removes the equal sign and type information when display-
              ing varbind values:
                  SNMPv2-MIB::sysUpTime.0 1:15:09:27.63

       -OQ    Removes the type information when displaying varbind val-
              ues:
                  SNMPv2-MIB::sysUpTime.0 = 1:15:09:27.63

       -Os    Display  the  MIB object name (plus any instance or other
              subidentifiers):
                  sysUpTime.0   =   Timeticks:   (14096763)   1    day,
              15:09:27.63

       -OS    Display the name of the MIB, as well as the object name:
                  SNMPv2-MIB::sysUpTime.0  =  Timeticks:  (14096763)  1
              day, 15:09:27.63

              This is the default OID output format.

       -Ot    Display TimeTicks values as raw numbers:
                  SNMPv2-MIB::sysUpTime.0 = 14096763

       -OT    If values are printed as Hex strings, display a printable
              version as well.

       -Ou    Display  the  OID in the traditional UCD-style (inherited
              from the original  CMU  code).   That  means  removing  a
              series  of "standard" prefixes from the OID, and display-
              ing the remaining list of  MIB  object  names  (plus  any
              other subidentifiers):
                  system.sysUpTime.0  =  Timeticks:  (14096763)  1 day,
              15:09:27.63

       -OU    Do not print the UNITS suffix at the end of the value.

       -Ov    Display the varbind value only, not the OID:
                  $ snmpget -c public -v 1 -Ov localhost ipForwarding.0
                  INTEGER: forwarding(1)

       -Ox    Display string values as Hex strings (unless there  is  a
              DISPLAY-HINT  defined  for the corresponding MIB object).
              By default, the library attempts to determine whether the
              value  is  a  printable or binary string, and displays it
              accordingly.

              This option does not affect objects that do have  a  Dis-
              play Hint.

       -OX    Display  table  indexes  in a more "program like" output,
              imitating a traditional array-style index format:
                  $ snmpgetnext -c public -v 1 localhost ipv6RouteTable
                  IPv6-MIB::ipv6RouteIfIndex.63.254.1.0.255.0.0.0.0.0.0.0.0.0.0.0.64.1 = INTEGER: 2
                  $ snmpgetnext -c public -v 1 -OX localhost ipv6RouteTable
                  IPv6-MIB::ipv6RouteIfIndex[3ffe:100:ff00:0:0:0:0:0][64][1] = INTEGER: 2

       Most of these options can also be configured  via  configuration
       tokens.  See the snmp.conf(5) manual page for details.


LOGGING OPTIONS
       The  mechanism and destination to use for logging of warning and
       error messages can be controlled by passing  various  parameters
       to the -L flag.

       -Le    Log messages to the standard error stream.

       -Lf FILE
              Log messages to the specified file.

       -Lo    Log messages to the standard output stream.

       -Ls FACILITY
              Log  messages  via  syslog,  using the specified facility
              ('d' for LOG_DAEMON, 'u' for  LOG_USER,  or  '0'-'7'  for
              LOG_LOCAL0 through LOG_LOCAL7).


       There  are  also "upper case" versions of each of these options,
       which allow the corresponding logging mechanism to be restricted
       to  certain priorities of message.  Using standard error logging
       as an example:

       -LE pri
              will log messages of priority 'pri' and above to standard
              error.

       -LE p1-p2
              will  log  messages  with  priority between 'p1' and 'p2'
              (inclusive) to standard error.

       For -LF and -LS the priority specification comes before the file
       or facility token.  The priorities recognised are:

              0 or !  for LOG_EMERG,
              1 or a for LOG_ALERT,
              2 or c for LOG_CRIT,
              3 or e for LOG_ERR,
              4 or w for LOG_WARNING,
              5 or n for LOG_NOTICE,
              6 or i for LOG_INFO, and
              7 or d for LOG_DEBUG.

       Normal  output  is  (or  will be!) logged at a priority level of
       LOG_NOTICE


INPUT OPTIONS
       The interpretation of input object names and the  values  to  be
       assigned  can  be  controlled using various parameters of the -I
       flag.  The default behaviour will be described  at  the  end  of
       this section.

       -Ib    specifies  that  the  given  name should be regarded as a
              regular expression, to match (case-insensitively) against
              object  names  in the MIB tree.  The "best" match will be
              used - calculated as the one that matches the closest  to
              the  beginning  of  the  node name and the highest in the
              tree.  For  example,  the  MIB  object  vacmSecurityModel
              could  be  matched  by  the  expression vacmsecuritymodel
              (full name, but different case), or  vacm.*model  (regexp
              pattern).

              Note  that  '.' is a special character in regular expres-
              sion patterns, so the expression cannot specify  instance
              subidentifiers  or  more  than  one object name.  A "best
              match" expression will only be applied against single MIB
              object  names.   For example, the expression sys*ontact.0
              would  not  match  the  instance  sysContact.0  (although
              sys*ontact  would match sysContact).  Similarly, specify-
              ing  a   MIB   module   name   will   not   succeed   (so
              SNMPv2-MIB::sys.*ontact would not match either).

       -Ih    disables the use of DISPLAY-HINT information when assign-
              ing values.  This would then require  providing  the  raw
              value:
                  snmpset ... HOST-RESOURCES-MIB::hrSystemDate.0
                                  x "07 D2 0C 0A 02 04 06 08"
              instead of a formatted version:
                  snmpset ... HOST-RESOURCES-MIB::hrSystemDate.0
                                  = 2002-12-10,2:4:6.8

       -Ir    disables  checking  table  indexes  and  the  value to be
              assigned against the relevant MIB definitions.  This will
              (hopefully)  result  in  the  remote  agent  reporting an
              invalid request, rather  than  checking  (and  rejecting)
              this before it is sent to the remote agent.

              Local checks are more efficient (and the diagnostics pro-
              vided also tend to be more precise), but  disabling  this
              behaviour  is particularly useful when testing the remote
              agent.

       -IR    enables "random access" lookup of MIB names.  Rather than
              providing  a  full OID path to the desired MIB object (or
              qualifying this object with an explicit MIB module name),
              the  MIB  tree  will  be searched for the matching object
              name.  Thus .iso.org.dod.internet.mib-2.system.sysDescr.0
              (or  SNMPv2-MIB::sysDescr.0)  can  be specified simply as
              sysDescr.0.

              Warning:
                     Since MIB object names are  not  globally  unique,
                     this  approach  may  return a different MIB object
                     depending on which MIB files have been loaded.

              The MIB-MODULE::objectName syntax has  the  advantage  of
              uniquely  identifying a particular MIB object, as well as
              being slightly more efficient (and automatically  loading
              the necessary MIB file if necessary).

       -Is SUFFIX
              adds  the  specified  suffix to each textual OID given on
              the command line.  This can be used to retrieve  multiple
              objects  from  the  same  row of a table, by specifying a
              common index value.

       -IS PREFIX
              adds the specified prefix to each textual  OID  given  on
              the  command  line.   This  can  be  used  to  specify an
              explicit MIB module name for all objects being  retrieved
              (or for incurably lazy typists).

       -Iu    enables  the traditional UCD-style approach to interpret-
              ing input OIDs.  This assumes that OIDs are rooted at the
              'mib-2'  point  in  the  tree  (unless they start with an
              explicit '.' or include a MIB module name).  So the  sys-
              Descr instance above would be referenced as system.sysDe-
              scr.0.


       Object names specified with a leading '.' are always interpreted
       as  "fully  qualified" OIDs, listing the sequence of MIB objects
       from the root of the MIB tree.  Such objects and those qualified
       by  an  explicit  MIB module name are unaffected by the -Ib, -IR
       and -Iu flags.

       Otherwise, if none of the above input options are specified, the
       default  behaviour  for a "relative" OID is to try and interpret
       it as an (implicitly) fully qualified OID,  then  apply  "random
       access"  lookup (-IR), followed by "best match" pattern matching
