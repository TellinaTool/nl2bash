ECHO(1)                   BSD General Commands Manual                  ECHO(1)

NAME
     echo -- write arguments to the standard output

SYNOPSIS
     echo [-n] [string ...]

DESCRIPTION
     The echo utility writes any specified operands, separated by single blank
     (` ') characters and followed by a newline (`\n') character, to the stan-
     dard output.

     The following option is available:

     -n    Do not print the trailing newline character.  This may also be
           achieved by appending `\c' to the end of the string, as is done by
           iBCS2 compatible systems.  Note that this option as well as the
           effect of `\c' are implementation-defined in IEEE Std 1003.1-2001
           (``POSIX.1'') as amended by Cor. 1-2002.  Applications aiming for
           maximum portability are strongly encouraged to use printf(1) to
           suppress the newline character.

     Some shells may provide a builtin echo command which is similar or iden-
     tical to this utility.  Most notably, the builtin echo in sh(1) does not
     accept the -n option.  Consult the builtin(1) manual page.

EXIT STATUS
     The echo utility exits 0 on success, and >0 if an error occurs.

STANDARDS

     amended by Cor. 1-2002.
