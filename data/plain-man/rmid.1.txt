NAME
       rmid - RMI activation system daemon

SYNOPSIS
       rmid [ options ]

DESCRIPTION
       The  rmid  tool starts the activation system daemon. Before activatable
       objects can be either registered with the activation  system  or  acti-
       vated  in a Java VM, the activation system daemon must be started.  See
       the RMI Specification and Activation Tutorials for details  on  how  to
       write programs that use activatable remote objects.

       The daemon can be started by executing the rmid command, and specifying
       a security policy file, as follows:

            example% rmid -J-Djava.security.policy=rmid.policy

       Note: When running Sun's implementation of rmid, by  default  you  will
       need  to specify a security policy file so that rmid can verify whether
       or not the information in each ActivationGroupDesc  is  allowed  to  be
       used  to  launch a JVM for an activation group.  Specifically, the com-
       mand and options specified by the CommandEnvironment and any Properties
       passed  to  an ActivationGroupDesc's constructor must now be explicitly
       allowed in the security  policy  file  for  rmid.   The  value  of  the
       sun.rmi.activation.execPolicy  property  dictates  the policy that rmid
       uses to determine whether or not  the  information  in  an  Activation-
       GroupDesc may be used to launch a JVM for an activation group.

       Executing rmid by default

              o starts  the  Activator and an internal registry on the default
                port, 1098, and
              o binds  an  ActivationSystem  to  the   name   java.rmi.activa-
                tion.ActivationSystem in this internal registry.

       To  specify  an  alternate  port for the registry, you must specify the
       -port option when starting up rmid.  For example,

            rmid -J-Djava.security.policy=rmid.policy -port 1099

       starts the activation system daemon and a registry  on  the  registry's
       default port, 1099.

   Starting rmid from inetd/xinetd
       An  alternative  to starting rmid from the command line is to configure
       inetd (Solaris) or xinetd (Linux) to start rmid on demand.

       When rmid starts up, it attempts to obtain an inherited channel (inher-
       ited from inetd/xinetd) by invoking the System.inheritedChannel method.
       If the inherited channel is null, then rmid was started from  the  com-
       mand line, and it starts up as described above.

       If the inherited channel is not an instance of java.io.channels.Server-
       SocketChannel, rmid exits.

       If the inherited channel is a ServerSocketChannel instance,  then  rmid
       uses the java.net.ServerSocket obtained from the ServerSocketChannel as
       the server socket that accepts  requests  for  the  remote  objects  it
       exports,  namely  the registry in which the java.rmi.activation.Activa-
       tionSystem  is  bound  and  the  java.rmi.activation.Activator   remote
       object.

       The rmid tool, when started from inetd/xinetd, behaves the same as when
       it is started from the command line, except:

       o Output printed to System.err is redirected
         to a file. This file is located in the  directory  specified  by  the
         java.io.tmpdir  system property (typically /var/tmp or /tmp) with the
         prefix "rmid-err" and the suffix "tmp".

       o The -port option is disallowed. If this
         option is specified, rmid will exit with an error message.

       o The -log option is required. If this option
         is not specified, rmid will exit with an error message.

       See the man pages for inetd (Solaris) or xinetd (Linux) for details  on
       how to configure services to be started on demand.

OPTIONS
       -CsomeCommandLineOption
              Specifies an option that is passed as a command-line argument to
              each child process (activation group) of rmid when that  process
              is created.  For example, you could pass a property to each Java
              virtual machine spawned by the activation system daemon:

                   rmid -C-Dsome.property=value

              This ability to pass command-line arguments  o  child  processes
              can  be  useful  for debugging.  For example, the following com-
              mand:

                   rmid -C-Djava.rmi.server.logCalls=true

              will enable server-call logging in all child JVMs.

       -JsomeCommandLineOption
              Specifies an option that is passed to the java interpreter  run-
              ning  rmid.  For example, to specify that rmid use a policy file
              named rmid.policy, the -J option  can  be  used  to  define  the
              java.security.policy property on rmid's command line.  For exam-
              ple:

                   rmid -J-Djava.security.policy=rmid.policy

       -J-Dsun.rmi.activation.execPolicy=policy
              Specifies the policy that rmid employs  to  check  commands  and
              command-line  options used to launch the JVM in which an activa-
              tion group runs.  Please note that this option  exists  only  in
              Sun's  implementation  of  the  RMI  activation daemon.  If this
              property is not specified on the command line, the result is the
              same as if -J-Dsun.rmi.activation.execPolicy=default were speci-
              fied.  The possible values of policy  can  be  default,  policy-
              ClassName, or none:

              o default  (or  if  this  property  is  unspecified) The default
                execPolicy allows rmid to execute commands with specific  com-
                mand-line  options only if rmid has been granted permission to
                execute those commands and options in the security policy file
                that rmid uses.  Only the default activation group implementa-
                tion can be used with the default execution policy.

                rmid launches a JVM for an activation group using the informa-
                tion in the group's registered activation group descriptor, an
                ActivationGroupDesc.   The  group  descriptor   specifies   an
                optional ActivationGroupDesc.CommandEnvironment which includes
                the command to execute to start the activation group  as  well
                as  any  command line options to be added to the command line.
                By default, rmid uses the java  command  found  in  java.home.
                The  group  descriptor also contains properties overrides that
                are added to the command line as options defined as:

                     -Dproperty=value

                The  permission  com.sun.rmi.rmid.ExecPermission  is  used  to
                grant  rmid  permission to execute a command, specified in the
                group descriptor's CommandEnvironment to launch an  activation
                group.   The  permission com.sun.rmi.rmid.ExecOptionPermission
                is used to allow rmid to use command-line  options,  specified
                as  properties overrides in the group descriptor or as options
                in  the  CommandEnvironment,  when  launching  the  activation
                group.

                When  granting rmid permission to execute various commands and
                options, the permissions ExecPermission and  ExecOptionPermis-
                sion  need  to be granted universally (that is, granted to all
                code sources).

                ExecPermission
                       The ExecPermission class represents permission for rmid
                       to  execute  a specific command to launch an activation
                       group.

                       Syntax
                       The name of an ExecPermission is the  path  name  of  a
                       command  to  grant  rmid permission to execute.  A path
                       name that ends in "/*" indicates  all  the  files  con-
                       tained in that directory (where "/" is the file-separa-
                       tor character, File.separatorChar).  A path  name  that
                       ends  with  "/-" indicates all files and subdirectories
                       contained in that directory (recursively).  A path name
                       consisting of the special token "<<ALL FILES>>" matches
                       any file.

                       Note: A path name consisting of a single "*"  indicates
                       all  the  files  in the current directory, while a path
                       name consisting of a single "-" indicates all the files
                       in  the  current  directory and (recursively) all files
                       and subdirectories contained in the current  directory.

                ExecOptionPermission
                       The  ExecOptionPermission  class  represents permission
                       for rmid to use a  specific  command-line  option  when
                       launching  an activation group.  The name of an ExecOp-
                       tionPermission is the value of a command line option.

                       Syntax
                       Options support a limited wildcard scheme.  An asterisk
                       signifies  a  wildcard  match, and it may appear as the
                       option name itself (that is, it matches any option), or
                       an  asterisk  may  appear at the end of the option name
                       only if the asterisk follows either a "." or "=".

                       For example: "*" or "-Dfoo.*" or "-Da.b.c=*" is  valid;
                       "*foo" or "-Da*b" or "ab*" is not.

              Policy file for rmid
                When  granting rmid permission to execute various commands and
                options, the permissions ExecPermission and  ExecOptionPermis-
                sion  need  to be granted universally (that is, granted to all
                code sources).  It is safe to grant these permissions  univer-
                sally because only rmid checks these permissions.

                An example policy file that grants various execute permissions
                to rmid is:

                grant {
                    permission com.sun.rmi.rmid.ExecPermission
                        "/files/apps/java/jdk1.2.2/bin/java";

                    permission com.sun.rmi.rmid.ExecPermission
                        "/files/apps/rmidcmds/*";

                    permission com.sun.rmi.rmid.ExecOptionPermission
                        "-Djava.security.policy=/files/policies/group.policy";

                    permission com.sun.rmi.rmid.ExecOptionPermission
                        "-Djava.security.debug=*";

                    permission com.sun.rmi.rmid.ExecOptionPermission
                        "-Dsun.rmi.*";
                };

                The first permission granted allow rmid to execute  the  1.2.2
                version  of  the  java command, specified by its explicit path
                names.  Note that by default, the version of the java  command
                found  in java.home is used (the same one that rmid uses), and
                does not need to be specified in the policy file.   The  third
                permission allows rmid to execute any command in the directory
                /files/apps/rmidcmds.

                The fourth permission granted, an ExecOptionPermission, allows
                rmid  to  launch an activation group that defines the security
                policy file to be /files/policies/group.policy.  The next per-
                mission  allows the java.security.debug property to be used by
                an activation group.  The last permission allows any  property
                in  the  sun.rmi property name hierarchy to be used by activa-
                tion groups.

                To start rmid with a  policy  file,  the  java.security.policy
                property  needs  to  be specified on rmid's command line.  For
                example:

                     rmid -J-Djava.security.policy=rmid.policy

              o policyClassName

                If the default behavior is not flexible enough, an administra-
                tor can provide, when starting rmid, the name of a class whose
                checkExecCommand method is executed in order to check commands
                to be executed by rmid.

                The  policyClassName  specifies  a public class with a public,
                no-argument constructor and an implementation of the following
                checkExecCommand method:

                     public void checkExecCommand(ActivationGroupDesc desc,
                                                              String[] command)
                                     throws SecurityException;

                Before  launching an activation group, rmid calls the policy's
                checkExecCommand  method,  passing  it  the  activation  group
                descriptor  and  an  array  containing the complete command to
                launch the activation group.  If the checkExecCommand throws a
                SecurityException,  rmid  will not launch the activation group
                and an  ActivationException  will  be  thrown  to  the  caller
                attempting to activate the object.

              o none

                If the sun.rmi.activation.execPolicy property value is "none",
                then rmid will not  perform  any  validation  of  commands  to
                launch activation groups.

       -log dir
              Specifies the name of the directory the activation system daemon
              uses to write its database and associated information.  The  log
              directory  defaults  to creating a directory, log, in the direc-
              tory in which the rmid command was executed.

       -port port
              Specifies the port rmid's registry uses.  The activation  system
              daemon  binds the ActivationSystem, with the name java.rmi.acti-
              vation.ActivationSystem, in this registry.   Thus,  the  Activa-
              tionSystem  on  the local machine can be obtained using the fol-
              lowing Naming.lookup method call:

              import java.rmi.*;
              import java.rmi.activation.*;

              ActivationSystem system;
              system = (ActivationSystem)
              Naming.lookup("//:port/java.rmi.activation.ActivationSystem");

       -stop  Stops the current invocation of rmid, for a  port  specified  by
              the  -port  option.   If  no port is specified, it will stop the
              rmid running on port 1098.
