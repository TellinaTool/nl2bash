LEAVE(1)                  BSD General Commands Manual                 LEAVE(1)

NAME
     leave -- remind you when you have to leave

SYNOPSIS
     leave [[+]hhmm]

DESCRIPTION
     The leave utility waits until the specified time, then reminds you that
     you have to leave.  You are reminded 5 minutes and 1 minute before the
     actual time, at the time, and every minute thereafter.  When you log off,
     leave exits just before it would have printed the next message.

     The following options are available:

     hhmm    The time of day is in the form hhmm where hh is a time in hours
             (on a 12 or 24 hour clock), and mm are minutes.  All times are
             converted to a 12 hour clock, and assumed to be in the next 12
             hours.

     +       If the time is preceded by `+', the alarm will go off in hours
             and minutes from the current time.

     If no argument is given, leave prompts with "When do you have to leave?".
     A reply of newline causes leave to exit, otherwise the reply is assumed
     to be a time.  This form is suitable for inclusion in a .login or
     .profile.

     To get rid of leave you should either log off or use `kill -s KILL' giv-
     ing its process id.
