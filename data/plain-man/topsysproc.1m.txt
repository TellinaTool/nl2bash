NAME
       topsysproc - top syscalls by process name. Uses DTrace.

SYNOPSIS
       topsysproc [-Cs] [interval [count]]

DESCRIPTION
       This  program continually prints a report of the number of system calls
       by process name, and refreshes the display every 1 second or as  speci-
       fied at the command line. Similar data can be fetched with "prstat -m".

       Since this uses DTrace, only users with root privileges  can  run  this
       command.

       -s     print per second values

       Print every 5 seconds,
              # topsysproc 5

       Print a scrolling output,
              # topsysproc -C
