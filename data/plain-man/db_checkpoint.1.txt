NAME
     db_checkpoint

SYNOPSIS
     db_checkpoint [-1Vv] [-h home] [-k kbytes] [-L file] [-P password]
                   [-p min]

DESCRIPTION
     The db_checkpoint utility is a daemon process that monitors the database
     log, and periodically calls DB_ENV->txn_checkpoint to checkpoint it.

     The options are as follows:

     -1
        Checkpoint the log once, regardless of whether or not there has been
        activity since the last checkpoint and then exit.

     -h
        Specify a home directory for the database environment; by default, the
        current working directory is used.

     -k
        Checkpoint the database at least as often as every kbytes of log file
        are written.

     -L
        Log the execution of the db_checkpoint utility to the specified file
        in the following format, where ### is the process ID, and the date is
        the time the utility was started.

              db_checkpoint: ### Wed Jun 15 01:23:45 EDT 1995

        This file will be removed if the db_checkpoint utility exits grace-
        fully.

     -P
        Specify an environment password. Although Berkeley DB utilities over-
        write password strings as soon as possible, be aware there may be a
        window of vulnerability on systems where unprivileged users can see
        command-line arguments or where utilities are not able to overwrite
        the memory containing the command-line arguments.

     -p
        Checkpoint the database at least every min minutes if there has been
        any activity since the last checkpoint.

     -V
        Write the library version number to the standard output, and exit.

     -v
        Write the time of each checkpoint attempt to the standard output.

     At least one of the -1, -k, and -p options must be specified.

     The db_checkpoint utility uses a Berkeley DB environment (as described
     for the -h option, the environment variable DB_HOME, or because the util-
     ity was run in a directory containing a Berkeley DB environment). In
     order to avoid environment corruption when using a Berkeley DB environ-
     ment, db_checkpoint should always be given the chance to detach from the
     environment and exit gracefully. To cause db_checkpoint to release all
     environment resources and exit cleanly, send it an interrupt signal (SIG-
     INT).

     The db_checkpoint utility does not attempt to create the Berkeley DB
     shared memory regions if they do not already exist. The application that
     creates the region should be started first, and once the region is cre-
     ated, the db_checkpoint utility should be started.

     The DB_ENV->txn_checkpoint method is the underlying method used by the
     db_checkpoint utility. See the db_checkpoint utility source code for an
     example of using DB_ENV->txn_checkpoint in a IEEE/ANSI Std 1003.1 (POSIX)
     environment.

     The db_checkpoint utility exits 0 on success, and >0 if an error occurs.

ENVIRONMENT
     DB_HOME  If the -h option is not specified and the environment variable
              DB_HOME is set, it is used as the path of the database home, as
              described in DB_ENV->open.
