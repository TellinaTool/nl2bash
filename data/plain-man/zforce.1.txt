ZFORCE(1)                 BSD General Commands Manual                ZFORCE(1)

NAME
     zforce -- force gzip files to have a .gz suffix

SYNOPSIS
     zforce file ...

DESCRIPTION
     The zforce utility renames gzip(1) files to have a `.gz' suffix, so that
     gzip(1) will not compress them twice.  This can be useful if file names
     were truncated during a file transfer.  Files that have an existing
     `.gz', `-gz', `_gz', `.tgz' or `.taz' suffix, or that have not been com-
     pressed by gzip(1), are ignored.

SEE ALSO
     gzip(1)

CAVEATS
     zforce overwrites existing files without warning.
