NAME
     base64 -- Encode and decode using Base64 representation

SYNOPSIS
     base64 [-h | -D] [-b count] [-i input_file] [-o output_file]

DESCRIPTION
     base64 encodes and decodes Base64 data, as specified in RFC 4648. With no
     options, base64 reads raw data from stdin and writes encoded data as a
     continuous block to stdout.

OPTIONS
     The following options are available:
     -b count
     --break=count        Insert line breaks every count characters. Default
                          is 0, which generates an unbroken stream.

     -D
     --decode             Decode incoming Base64 stream into binary data.

     -h
     --help               Print usage summary and exit.

     -i input_file
     --input=input_file   Read input from input_file.  Default is stdin; pass-
                          ing - also represents stdin.

     -o output_file
     --output=output_file
                          Write output to output_file.  Default is stdout;
                          passing - also represents stdout.
