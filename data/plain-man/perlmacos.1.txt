NAME
       perlmacos - Perl under Mac OS (Classic)

SYNOPSIS
       For Mac OS X see README.macosx

       Perl under Mac OS Classic has not been supported since before Perl 5.10
       (April 2004).

       When we say "Mac OS" below, we mean Mac OS 7, 8, and 9, and not Mac OS
       X.

DESCRIPTION
       The port of Perl to to Mac OS was officially removed as of Perl 5.12,
       though the last official production release of MacPerl corresponded to
       Perl 5.6. While Perl 5.10 included the port to Mac OS,
       ExtUtils::MakeMaker, a core part of Perl's module installation
       infrastructure officially dropped support for Mac OS in April 2004.

AUTHOR
       Perl was ported to Mac OS by Matthias Neeracher <neeracher@mac.com>.
       Chris Nandor <pudge@pobox.com> continued development and maintenance
       for the duration of the port's life.
