NAME
       infocmp - compare or print out terminfo descriptions

SYNOPSIS
       infocmp [-1CEFGILTUVcdegilnpqrtux]
             [-v n] [-s d| i| l| c] [-R subset]
             [-w width] [-A directory] [-B directory]
             [termname...]

DESCRIPTION
       infocmp  can be used to compare a binary terminfo entry with other ter-
       minfo entries, rewrite a terminfo description to take advantage of  the
       use=  terminfo  field,  or  print  out  a terminfo description from the
       binary file (term) in a variety of formats.  In all cases, the  boolean
       fields  will be printed first, followed by the numeric fields, followed
       by the string fields.

   Default Options
       If no options are specified and zero or one  termnames  are  specified,
       the -I option will be assumed.  If more than one termname is specified,
       the -d option will be assumed.

   Comparison Options [-d] [-c] [-n]
       infocmp  compares  the  terminfo  description  of  the  first  terminal
       termname  with  each  of  the descriptions given by the entries for the
       other terminal's termnames.  If a capability is defined for only one of
       the  terminals, the value returned will depend on the type of the capa-
       bility: F for boolean variables, -1 for integer variables, and NULL for
       string variables.

       The  -d  option  produces  a  list of each capability that is different
       between two entries.  This option is  useful  to  show  the  difference
       between two entries, created by different people, for the same or simi-
       lar terminals.

       The -c option produces a list of each capability that is common between
       two  entries.   Capabilities that are not set are ignored.  This option
       can be used as a quick check to see if the -u option is worth using.

       The -n option produces a list of each capability  that  is  in  neither
       entry.   If  no termnames are given, the environment variable TERM will
       be used for both of the termnames.  This can be used as a  quick  check
       to see if anything was left out of a description.

   Source Listing Options [-I] [-L] [-C] [-r]
       The  -I, -L, and -C options will produce a source listing for each ter-
       minal named.

            -I   use the terminfo names
            -L   use the long C variable name listed in <term.h>
            -C   use the termcap names
            -r   when using -C, put out all capabilities in termcap form

       If no termnames are given, the environment variable TERM will  be  used
       for the terminal name.

       The  source produced by the -C option may be used directly as a termcap
       entry, but not all parameterized strings can be changed to the  termcap
       format.   infocmp  will  attempt  to  convert most of the parameterized
       information, and anything not converted will be plainly marked  in  the
       output and commented out.  These should be edited by hand.

       All  padding  information  for  strings  will be collected together and
       placed at the beginning of the string where termcap expects it.  Manda-
       tory  padding  (padding  information  with  a trailing '/') will become
       optional.

       All termcap variables no longer supported by terminfo,  but  which  are
       derivable  from other terminfo variables, will be output.  Not all ter-
       minfo capabilities will be translated; only those variables which  were
       part of termcap will normally be output.  Specifying the -r option will
       take off this restriction, allowing all capabilities to  be  output  in
       termcap form.

       Note that because padding is collected to the beginning of the capabil-
       ity, not all capabilities are output.  Mandatory padding  is  not  sup-
       ported.   Because termcap strings are not as flexible, it is not always
       possible to convert a terminfo string  capability  into  an  equivalent
       termcap  format.  A subsequent conversion of the termcap file back into
       terminfo format will not necessarily reproduce  the  original  terminfo
       source.

       Some  common  terminfo  parameter sequences, their termcap equivalents,
       and some terminal types which commonly have such sequences, are:

           terminfo                    termcap   Representative Terminals

   Use= Option [-u]
       The -u option produces a terminfo source description of the first  ter-
       minal  termname  which is relative to the sum of the descriptions given
       by the entries for the other terminals termnames.  It does this by ana-
       lyzing  the  differences  between  the  first  termname  and  the other
       termnames and producing a description with use= fields  for  the  other
       terminals.  In this manner, it is possible to retrofit generic terminfo
       entries into a terminal's description.  Or, if  two  similar  terminals
       exist, but were coded at different times or by different people so that
       each description is a full description, using infocmp  will  show  what
       can be done to change one description to be relative to the other.

       A  capability  will  get  printed  with  an at-sign (@) if it no longer
       exists in the first termname, but one of  the  other  termname  entries
       contains  a  value  for  it.   A capability's value gets printed if the
       value in the first termname is not found in any of the  other  termname
       entries,  or  if  the first of the other termname entries that has this
       capability gives a different value for the capability than that in  the
       first termname.

       The order of the other termname entries is significant.  Since the ter-
       minfo compiler tic does a left-to-right scan of the capabilities, spec-
       ifying  two  use=  entries  that contain differing entries for the same
       capabilities will produce different results depending on the order that
       the  entries  are given in.  infocmp will flag any such inconsistencies
       between the other termname entries as they are found.

       Alternatively, specifying a capability after a use= entry that contains
       that  capability  will  cause  the  second specification to be ignored.
       Using infocmp to recreate a description can be a useful check  to  make
       sure  that  everything  was  specified correctly in the original source
       description.

       Another error that does not cause incorrect compiled  files,  but  will
       slow  down  the  compilation time, is specifying extra use= fields that
       are superfluous.  infocmp will flag any other termname use= fields that
       were not needed.

   Changing Databases [-A directory] [-B directory]
       The  location of the compiled terminfo database is taken from the envi-
       ronment variable TERMINFO .  If the variable is  not  defined,  or  the
       terminal  is  not found in that location, the system terminfo database,
       in /usr/share/terminfo, will be used.  The options -A  and  -B  may  be
       used  to  override  this location.  The -A option will set TERMINFO for
       the first termname and the -B option will set TERMINFO  for  the  other
       termnames.   With  this,  it  is possible to compare descriptions for a
       terminal with the same name located in two different  databases.   This
       is  useful  for comparing descriptions for the same terminal created by
       different people.

   Other Options
       -1   causes the fields to be printed out one to a line.  Otherwise, the
            fields  will be printed several to a line to a maximum width of 60
            characters.

       -a   tells infocmp to retain  commented-out  capabilities  rather  than
            discarding  them.   Capabilities  are  commented by prefixing them
            with a period.

       -E   Dump the capabilities of the given terminal as tables,  needed  in
            the  C initializer for a TERMTYPE structure (the terminal capabil-
            ity structure in the <term.h>).  This option is useful for prepar-
            ing  versions of the curses library hardwired for a given terminal
            type.  The tables are all declared static, and are named according
            to the type and the name of the corresponding terminal entry.

            Before  ncurses  5.0,  the split between the -e and -E options was
            not needed; but support for extended  names  required  making  the
            arrays  of terminal capabilities separate from the TERMTYPE struc-
            ture.

       -e   Dump the capabilities of the given terminal as a C initializer for
            a  TERMTYPE  structure  (the  terminal capability structure in the
            <term.h>).  This option is useful for preparing  versions  of  the
            curses library hardwired for a given terminal type.

       -F   compare terminfo files.  This assumes that two following arguments
            are filenames.   The  files  are  searched  for  pairwise  matches
            between  entries,  with  two entries considered to match if any of
            their names do.  The  report  printed  to  standard  output  lists
            entries  with  no matches in the other file, and entries with more
            than one match.  For entries with exactly one match it includes  a
            difference  report.  Normally, to reduce the volume of the report,
            use references are not resolved before  looking  for  differences,
            but resolution can be forced by also specifying -r.

       -f   Display  complex terminfo strings which contain if/then/else/endif
            expressions indented for readability.

       -G   Display constant literals in decimal form rather than their  char-
            acter equivalents.

       -g   Display  constant  character  literals  in quoted form rather than
            their decimal equivalents.

       -i   Analyze the initialization (is1, is2, is3), and reset  (rs1,  rs2,
            rs3),  strings  in  the entry.  For each string, the code tries to
            analyze it into actions in terms of the other capabilities in  the
            entry,  certain  X3.64/ISO  6429/ECMA-48 capabilities, and certain
            DEC  VT-series  private  modes  (the  set  of  recognized  special
            sequences  has  been  selected  for completeness over the existing
            terminfo database).  Each report line consists of  the  capability
            name,  followed  by  a  colon  and  space, followed by a printable
            expansion of the capability string with sections  matching  recog-
            nized  actions translated into {}-bracketed descriptions.  Here is
            a list of the DEC/ANSI special sequences recognized: i.

                         DEC[+-]ARM    auto-repeat mode

            It  also  recognizes  a  SGR  action  corresponding  to   ANSI/ISO
            6429/ECMA  Set  Graphics  Rendition, with the values NORMAL, BOLD,
            UNDERLINE, BLINK, and REVERSE.  All but  NORMAL  may  be  prefixed
            with `+' (turn on) or `-' (turn off).

       An SGR0 designates an empty highlight sequence (equivalent to {SGR:NOR-
       MAL}).

       -l   Set output format to terminfo.

       -p   Ignore padding specifications when comparing strings.

       -q   Make the comparison listing shorter by omitting  subheadings,  and
            using  "-"  for  absent capabilities, "@" for canceled rather than
            "NULL".

       -Rsubset
            Restrict output to a given subset.  This option is  for  use  with
            archaic  versions of terminfo like those on SVr1, Ultrix, or HP/UX
            that do not support the full set of SVR4/XSI Curses terminfo;  and
            variants  such  as AIX that have their own extensions incompatible
            with SVr4/XSI.  Available terminfo subsets are  "SVr1",  "Ultrix",
            "HP", and "AIX"; see terminfo(5) for details.  You can also choose
            the subset "BSD" which  selects  only  capabilities  with  termcap
            equivalents recognized by 4.4BSD.

       -s [d|i|l|c]
            The  -s  option sorts the fields within each type according to the
            argument below:

            d    leave fields in the order that they are stored  in  the  ter-
                 minfo database.

            i    sort by terminfo name.

            l    sort by the long C variable name.

            c    sort by the termcap name.

            If  the  -s  option  is  not given, the fields printed out will be
            sorted alphabetically by  the  terminfo  name  within  each  type,
            except  in  the  case of the -C or the -L options, which cause the
            sorting to be done by the termcap name  or  the  long  C  variable
            name, respectively.

       -T   eliminates  size-restrictions  on  the  generated  text.   This is
            mainly  useful  for  testing  and  analysis,  since  the  compiled
            descriptions  are  limited  (e.g., 1023 for termcap, 4096 for ter-
            minfo).

       -t   tells tic to discard commented-out  capabilities.   Normally  when
            translating  from terminfo to termcap, untranslatable capabilities
            are commented-out.

       -U   tells infocmp to not  post-process  the  data  after  parsing  the
            source  file.   This  feature helps when comparing the actual con-
            tents of two source files, since it excludes the  inferences  that
            infocmp makes to fill in missing data.

       -V   reports the version of ncurses which was used in this program, and
            exits.

       -v n prints out tracing information on standard error  as  the  program
            runs.  Higher values of n induce greater verbosity.

       -w width
            changes the output to width characters.

       -x   print information for user-defined capabilities.  These are exten-
            sions to the terminfo repertoire which can be loaded using the  -x
            option of tic.

FILES

EXTENSIONS
       The  -E,  -F,  -G,  -R,  -T,  -V, -a, -e, -f, -g, -i, -l, -p, -q and -t
       options are not supported in SVr4 curses.

       The -r option's notion of `termcap' capabilities is  System  V  Release
       4's.   Actual  BSD curses versions will have a more restricted set.  To
       see only the 4.4BSD set, use -r -RBSD.

BUGS
       The -F option of infocmp(1M) should be a toe(1M) mode.
