SUMMARY
       apxs  is  a  tool for building and installing extension modules for the
       Apache HyperText Transfer Protocol (HTTP) server. This is  achieved  by
       building  a  dynamic  shared  object  (DSO)  from one or more source or
       object files which then can be loaded into the Apache server under run-
       time via the LoadModule directive from mod_so.


       So to use this extension mechanism your platform has to support the DSO
       feature and your Apache httpd binary has to be built  with  the  mod_so
       module.  The apxs tool automatically complains if this is not the case.
       You can check this yourself by manually running the command


             $ httpd -l



       The module mod_so should be  part  of  the  displayed  list.  If  these
       requirements  are  fulfilled you can easily extend your Apache server's
       functionality by installing your own modules with the DSO mechanism  by
       the help of this apxs tool:


             $ apxs -i -a -c mod_foo.c
             gcc -fpic -DSHARED_MODULE -I/path/to/apache/include -c mod_foo.c
             ld -Bshareable -o mod_foo.so mod_foo.o
             cp mod_foo.so /path/to/apache/modules/mod_foo.so
             chmod 755 /path/to/apache/modules/mod_foo.so
             [activating module `foo' in /path/to/apache/etc/httpd.conf]
             $ apachectl restart
             /path/to/apache/sbin/apachectl restart: httpd not running, trying to start
             [Tue Mar 31 11:27:55 1998] [debug] mod_so.c(303): loaded module foo_module
             /path/to/apache/sbin/apachectl restart: httpd started
             $ _



       The  arguments  files can be any C source file (.c), a object file (.o)
       or even a library archive (.a). The apxs tool automatically  recognizes
       these extensions and automatically used the C source files for compila-
       tion while just using the object and  archive  files  for  the  linking
       phase. But when using such pre-compiled objects make sure they are com-
       piled for position independent code (PIC) to be able to use them for  a
       dynamically loaded shared object. For instance with GCC you always just
       have to use -fpic. For other C compilers consult its manual page or  at
       watch for the flags apxs uses to compile the object files.


       For  more details about DSO support in Apache read the documentation of
       mod_so or perhaps even read  the  src/modules/standard/mod_so.c  source
       file.



OPTIONS
   Common Options
       -n modname
              This explicitly sets the module name for the -i (install) and -g
              (template generation) option. Use this to explicitly specify the
              module  name.  For option -g this is required, for option -i the
              apxs tool tries to determine the name from the source or  (as  a
              fallback) at least by guessing it from the filename.


   Query Options
       -q     Performs  a query for variables and environment settings used to
              build httpd. When invoked without query  parameters,  it  prints
              all  known variables and their values. The optional -v parameter
              formats the list output. .PP Use this to manually determine set-
              tings  used  to  build the httpd that will load your module. For
              instance use INC=-I`apxs -q  INCLUDEDIR`  .PP  inside  your  own
              Makefiles  if you need manual access to Apache's C header files.


   Configuration Options
       -S name=value
              This option changes the apxs settings described above.


   Template Generation Options
       -g     This generates a subdirectory name (see option -n) and there two
              files: A sample module source file named mod_name.c which can be
              used as a template for creating your own modules or as  a  quick
              start  for  playing with the apxs mechanism. And a corresponding
              Makefile for even easier build and installing of this module.


   DSO Compilation Options
       -c     This indicates the compilation operation. It first compiles  the
              C  source  files  (.c)  of files into corresponding object files
              (.o) and then builds a dynamically shared object in  dsofile  by
              linking  these  object files plus the remaining object files (.o
              and .a) of files. If no -o option is specified the  output  file
              is  guessed  from  the  first filename in files and thus usually
              defaults to mod_name.so.

       -o dsofile
              Explicitly specifies the filename  of  the  created  dynamically
              shared  object.  If not specified and the name cannot be guessed
              from the files list, the fallback name mod_unknown.so is used.

       -D name=value
              This option is directly passed through to the  compilation  com-
              mand(s).  Use this to add your own defines to the build process.

       -I incdir
              This option is directly passed through to the  compilation  com-
              mand(s).  Use this to add your own include directories to search
              to the build process.

       -L libdir
              This option is directly passed through to  the  linker  command.
              Use  this  to  add your own library directories to search to the
              build process.

       -l libname
              This option is directly passed through to  the  linker  command.
              Use  this  to  add  your  own  libraries  to search to the build
              process.

       -Wc,compiler-flags
              This option passes compiler-flags as  additional  flags  to  the
              libtool  --mode=compile command. Use this to add local compiler-
              specific options.

       -Wl,linker-flags
              This option passes  linker-flags  as  additional  flags  to  the
              libtool  --mode=link  command. Use this to add local linker-spe-
              cific options.

       -p     This  option  causes  apxs  to  link  against  the  apr/apr-util
              libraries.  This  is  useful when compiling helper programs that
              use the apr/apr-util libraries.


   DSO Installation and Configuration Options
       -i     This indicates the installation operation and  installs  one  or
              more dynamically shared objects into the server's modules direc-
              tory.

       -a     This activates the module by automatically adding a  correspond-
              ing  LoadModule  line to Apache's httpd.conf configuration file,
              or by enabling it if it already exists.

       -A     Same as option -a but the created LoadModule directive  is  pre-
              fixed  with  a  hash sign (#), i.e., the module is just prepared
              for later activation but initially disabled.

       -e     This indicates the editing operation, which can be used with the
              -a and -A options similarly to the -i operation to edit Apache's
              httpd.conf configuration file without attempting to install  the
              module.


EXAMPLES
       Assume you have an Apache module named mod_foo.c available which should
       extend Apache's server functionality. To accomplish this you first have
       to  compile the C source into a shared object suitable for loading into
       the Apache server under runtime via the following command:


             $ apxs -c mod_foo.c
             /path/to/libtool --mode=compile gcc ... -c mod_foo.c
             /path/to/libtool --mode=link gcc ... -o mod_foo.la mod_foo.slo
             $ _



       Then you have to update the Apache configuration by making sure a Load-
       Module  directive  is  present  to load this shared object. To simplify
       this step apxs provides an automatic way to install the  shared  object
       in  its  "modules"  directory  and updating the httpd.conf file accord-
       ingly. This can be achieved by running:


             $ apxs -i -a mod_foo.la
             /path/to/instdso.sh mod_foo.la /path/to/apache/modules
             /path/to/libtool --mode=install cp mod_foo.la /path/to/apache/modules
             ...
             chmod 755 /path/to/apache/modules/mod_foo.so
             [activating module `foo' in /path/to/apache/conf/httpd.conf]
             $ _



       This way a line named


             LoadModule foo_module modules/mod_foo.so



       is added to the configuration file if still not present. If you want to
       have this disabled per default use the -A option, i.e.


             $ apxs -i -A mod_foo.c



       For  a  quick test of the apxs mechanism you can create a sample Apache
       module template plus a corresponding Makefile via:


             $ apxs -g -n foo
             Creating [DIR]  foo
             Creating [FILE] foo/Makefile
             Creating [FILE] foo/modules.mk
             Creating [FILE] foo/mod_foo.c
             Creating [FILE] foo/.deps
             $ _



       Then you can immediately compile  this  sample  module  into  a  shared
       object and load it into the Apache server:


             $ cd foo
             $ make all reload
             apxs -c mod_foo.c
             /path/to/libtool --mode=compile gcc ... -c mod_foo.c
             /path/to/libtool --mode=link gcc ... -o mod_foo.la mod_foo.slo
             apxs -i -a -n "foo" mod_foo.la
             /path/to/instdso.sh mod_foo.la /path/to/apache/modules
             /path/to/libtool --mode=install cp mod_foo.la /path/to/apache/modules
             ...
             chmod 755 /path/to/apache/modules/mod_foo.so
             [activating module `foo' in /path/to/apache/conf/httpd.conf]
             apachectl restart
             /path/to/apache/sbin/apachectl restart: httpd not running, trying to start
             [Tue Mar 31 11:27:55 1998] [debug] mod_so.c(303): loaded module foo_module
             /path/to/apache/sbin/apachectl restart: httpd started
             $ _
