OSASCRIPT(1)              BSD General Commands Manual             OSASCRIPT(1)

NAME
     osascript -- execute OSA scripts (AppleScript, JavaScript, etc.)

SYNOPSIS
     osascript [-l language] [-i] [-s flags] [-e statement | programfile]
               [argument ...]

DESCRIPTION
     osascript executes the given OSA script, which may be plain text or a
     compiled script (.scpt) created by Script Editor or osacompile(1).  By
     default, osascript treats plain text as AppleScript, but you can change
     this using the -l option.  To get a list of the OSA languages installed
     on your system, use osalang(1).

     osascript will look for the script in one of the following three places:

     1.   Specified line by line using -e switches on the command line.

     2.   Contained in the file specified by the first filename on the command
          line.  This file may be plain text or a compiled script.

     3.   Passed in using standard input.  This works only if there are no
          filename arguments; to pass arguments to a STDIN-read script, you
          must explicitly specify ``-'' for the script name.

     Any arguments following the script will be passed as a list of strings to
     the direct parameter of the ``run'' handler.  For example, in Apple-
     Script:

           a.scpt:
           on run argv
               return "hello, " & item 1 of argv & "."
           end run

           % osascript a.scpt world
           hello, world.

     The options are as follows:

     -e statement
           Enter one line of a script.  If -e is given, osascript will not
           look for a filename in the argument list.  Multiple -e options may
           be given to build up a multi-line script.  Because most scripts use
           characters that are special to many shell programs (for example,
           AppleScript uses single and double quote marks, ``('', ``)'', and
           ``*''), the statement will have to be correctly quoted and escaped
           to get it past the shell intact.

     -i    Interactive mode: osascript will prompt for one line at a time, and
           print the result, if applicable, after each line.  Any script sup-
           plied as a command argument using -e or programfile will be loaded,
           but not executed, before starting the interactive prompt.

     -l language
           Override the language for any plain text files.  Normally, plain
           text files are compiled as AppleScript.

     -s flags
           Modify the output style.  The flags argument is a string consisting
           of any of the modifier characters e, h, o, and s.  Multiple modi-
           fiers can be concatenated in the same string, and multiple -s
           options can be specified.  The modifiers come in exclusive pairs;
           if conflicting modifiers are specified, the last one takes prece-
           dence.  The meanings of the modifier characters are as follows:

           h  Print values in human-readable form (default).
           s  Print values in recompilable source form.

              osascript normally prints its results in human-readable form:
              strings do not have quotes around them, characters are not
              escaped, braces for lists and records are omitted, etc.  This is
              generally more useful, but can introduce ambiguities.  For exam-
              ple, the lists `{"foo", "bar"}' and `{{"foo", {"bar"}}}' would
              both be displayed as `foo, bar'.  To see the results in an unam-
              biguous form that could be recompiled into the same value, use
              the s modifier.

           e  Print script errors to stderr (default).
           o  Print script errors to stdout.

              osascript normally prints script errors to stderr, so downstream
              clients only see valid results.  When running automated tests,
              however, using the o modifier lets you distinguish script
              errors, which you care about matching, from other diagnostic
              output, which you don't.

HISTORY
     osascript in Mac OS X 10.0 would translate `\r' characters in the output
     to `\n' and provided c and r modifiers for the -s option to change this.
     osascript now always leaves the output alone; pipe through tr(1) if nec-
     essary.

     Prior to Mac OS X 10.4, osascript did not allow passing arguments to the
     script.
