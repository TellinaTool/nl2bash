SNTP(1)                       Programmer's Manual                      SNTP(1)



NAME
       sntp - standard SNTP program

SYNOPSIS
       sntp [-flag [value]]... [--opt-name [[=| ]value]]...
               hostname-or-IP ...

DESCRIPTION
       This  manual page briefly documents the sntp command.  sntp can be used
       as a SNTP client to query a NTP or SNTP server and either  display  the
       time or set the local system's time (given suitable privilege).  It can
       be run as an interactive command or in a cron job.

       NTP (the Network Time Protocol) and SNTP (the Simple Network Time  Pro-
       tocol)  are  defined  and  described  by draft-ietf-ntp-ntpv4-proto-13,
       which should become a full RFC any month now.


       The default is to write the estimated correct local date and time (i.e.
       not  UTC)  to  the  standard  output  in  a  format  like  '1996 Oct 15
       20:17:25.123 +4.567 +/- 0.089 secs', where the '+4.567 +/- 0.089  secs'
       indicates  the local clock is 4.567 seconds behind the correct time (so
       4.567 seconds must be added to the local clock to get  it  to  be  cor-
       rect),  and the time of 1996 Oct 15 20:17:25.123 is believed to be cor-
       rect to within +/- 0.089 seconds.

OPTIONS
       -4, --ipv4
              Force IPv4 DNS name resolution.  This option must not appear  in
              combination with any of the following options: ipv6.

              Force DNS resolution of following host names on the command line
              to the IPv4 namespace.

       -6, --ipv6
              Force IPv6 DNS name resolution.  This option must not appear  in
              combination with any of the following options: ipv4.

              Force DNS resolution of following host names on the command line
              to the IPv6 namespace.

       -d, --normalverbose
              Normal verbose.

              Diagnostic messages for non-fatal errors and a limited amount of
              tracing  should be written to standard error.  Fatal ones always
              produce a diagnostic.  This option should be set when there is a
              suspected problem with the server, network or the source.

       -K file-name, --kod=file-name
              KoD history filename.

              Modifies  the  filename to be used to persist the history of KoD
              responses received from servers.  The  default  is  /var/db/ntp-
              kod.

       -p, --syslog
              Logging with syslog.  This option must not appear in combination
              with any of the following options: filelog.

              When this option is set all logging will be done using syslog.

       -l file-name, --filelog=file-name
              Log to specified logfile.  This option must not appear in combi-
              nation with any of the following options: syslog.

              This option causes the client to write log messages to the spec-
              ified logfile.

       -s, --settod
              Set (step) the time with settimeofday().  This option  must  not
              appear  in  combination  with any of the following options: adj-
              time.



       -j, --adjtime
              Set (slew) the time with adjtime().  This option must not appear
              in combination with any of the following options: settod.



       -b broadcast-address, --broadcast=broadcast-address
              Use broadcasts to the address specified for synchronisation.

              If specified SNTP will listen to the specified broadcast address
              for NTP broadcasts.  The default maximum wait time, 68  seconds,
              can be modified with -t.

       -t seconds, --timeout=seconds
              Specify  the  number  of  seconds  to wait for broadcasts.  This
              option takes an integer number as  its  argument.   The  default
              seconds for this option is:
                   68

              When waiting for a broadcast packet SNTP will wait the number of
              seconds specified before giving up.  Default 68 seconds.

       -a auth-keynumber, --authentication=auth-keynumber
              Enable authentication with the key auth-keynumber.  This  option
              takes an integer number as its argument.

              This  option  enables  authentication using the key specified in
              this option's argument.  The argument  of  this  option  is  the
              keyid,  a  number specified in the keyfile as this key's identi-
              fier. See the keyfile option (-k) for more details.

       -k file-name, --keyfile=file-name
              Specify a keyfile. SNTP will look in this file for the key spec-
              ified with -a.

              This  option specifies the keyfile. SNTP will search for the key
              specified with -a keyno in this file. Key files follow the  fol-
              lowing format:

              keyid keytype key

              Where      keyid is a number identifying this key keytype is one
              of the follow: S  Key in 64 Bit hexadecimal number as  specified
              in  in the DES specification.  N  Key in 64 Bit hexadecimal num-
              ber as specified in the NTP standard.  A  Key in a 1-to-8  char-
              acter  ASCII  string.  M  Key in a 1-to-8 character ASCII string
              using the MD5 authentication scheme.

              For more information see ntp.keys(5).

       -?, --help
              Display extended usage information and exit.

       -!, --more-help
              Extended usage information passed thru pager.

       -> [rcfile], --save-opts[=rcfile]
              Save the option state to rcfile.  The default is the  last  con-
              figuration file listed in the OPTION PRESETS section, below.

       -< rcfile, --load-opts=rcfile, --no-load-opts
              Load  options  from  rcfile.  The no-load-opts form will disable
              the loading of earlier RC/INI files.  --no-load-opts is  handled
              early, out of order.

       - [{v|c|n}], --version[={v|c|n}]
              Output  version of program and exit.  The default mode is `v', a
              simple version.  The `c' mode will print  copyright  information
              and `n' will print the full copyright notice.

OPTION PRESETS
       Any option that is not marked as not presettable may be preset by load-
       ing values from configuration ("RC" or ".INI") file(s) and values  from
       environment variables named:
         SNTP_<option-name> or SNTP
       The  environmental  presets  take precedence (are processed later than)
       the configuration files.  The homerc files are "$HOME",  and  ".".   If
       any  of  these  are  directories,  then the file .ntprc is searched for
       within those directories.

USAGE
       The simplest use of this program is as an unprivileged command to check
       the current time and error in the local clock.  For example:

              sntp ntpserver.somewhere

       With suitable privilege, it can be run as a command or in a cron job to
       reset the local clock from a reliable  server,  like  the  ntpdate  and
       rdate commands.  For example:

              sntp -a ntpserver.somewhere

RETURN VALUE
       The  program returns a zero exit status for success, and a non-zero one
       otherwise.
