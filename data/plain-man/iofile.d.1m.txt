iofile.d(1m)                     USER COMMANDS                    iofile.d(1m)



NAME
       iofile.d - I/O wait time by file and process. Uses DTrace.

SYNOPSIS
       iofile.d

DESCRIPTION
       This  prints  the  total  I/O  wait times for each filename by process.
       This can help determine why an  application  is  performing  poorly  by
       identifying  which file they are waiting on, and the total times.  Both
       disk and NFS I/O are measured.

       Since this uses DTrace, only users with root privileges  can  run  this
       command.

EXAMPLES
       Sample until Ctrl-C is hit then print report,
              # iofile.d


FIELDS
       PID    process ID

       CMD    process name

       TIME   total wait time for disk events, us

       FILE   file pathname


BASED ON
       /usr/demo/dtrace/iocpu.d


DOCUMENTATION
       See  the  DTraceToolkit for further documentation under the Docs direc-
       tory. The DTraceToolkit docs may include full worked examples with ver-
       bose descriptions explaining the output.

EXIT
       iofile.d will sample until Ctrl-C is hit.
