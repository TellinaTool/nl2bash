DESCRIPTION
       ldapmodrdn  is  a  shell-accessible  interface  to  the  ldap_rename(3)
       library call.

       ldapmodrdn opens a connection to an LDAP server,  binds,  and  modifies
       the RDN of entries.  The entry information is read from standard input,
       from file through the use of the -f option, or  from  the  command-line
       pair dn and rdn.

OPTIONS
       -r     Remove  old  RDN  values from the entry.  Default is to keep old
              values.

       -s newsup
              Specify a new superior entry. (I.e., move the target  entry  and
              make  it  a child of the new superior.)  This option is not sup-
              ported in LDAPv2.

       -n     Show what would be done,  but  don't  actually  change  entries.
              Useful for debugging in conjunction with -v.

       -v     Use verbose mode, with many diagnostics written to standard out-
              put.

       -c     Continuous operation mode.  Errors  are  reported,  but ldapmod-
              rdn  will   continue   with   modifications.   The default is to
              exit after reporting an error.

       -M[M]  Enable manage DSA IT control.  -MM makes control critical.

       -d debuglevel
              Set the LDAP debugging level to debuglevel.  ldapmodrdn must  be
              compiled  with  LDAP_DEBUG  defined  for this option to have any
              effect.

       -f file
              Read the entry modification information  from  file  instead  of
              from standard input or the command-line.

       -x     Use simple authentication instead of SASL.

       -D binddn
              Use the Distinguished Name binddn to bind to the LDAP directory.
              For SASL binds, the server is expected to ignore this value.

       -W     Prompt for simple authentication.  This is used instead of spec-
              ifying the password on the command line.

       -w passwd
              Use passwd as the password for simple authentication.

       -y passwdfile
              Use  complete  contents of passwdfile as the password for simple
              authentication.

       -H ldapuri
              Specify URI(s) referring to the ldap server(s); only the  proto-
              col/host/port  fields  are  allowed; a list of URI, separated by
              whitespace or commas is expected.

       -h ldaphost
              Specify an alternate host on which the ldap server  is  running.
              Deprecated in favor of -H.

       -p ldapport
              Specify  an  alternate TCP port where the ldap server is listen-
              ing.  Deprecated in favor of -H.

       -P {2|3}
              Specify the LDAP protocol version to use.

       -O security-properties
              Specify SASL security properties.

       -e [!]ext[=extparam]

       -E [!]ext[=extparam]

              Specify general extensions with -e and  search  extensions  with
              -E.  '!' indicates criticality.

              General extensions:
                [!]assert=<filter>   (an RFC 4515 Filter)
                [!]authzid=<authzid> ("dn:<dn>" or "u:<user>")
                [!]manageDSAit
                [!]noop
                ppolicy
                [!]postread[=<attrs>]        (a comma-separated attribute list)
                [!]preread[=<attrs>] (a comma-separated attribute list)
                abandon, cancel (SIGINT sends abandon/cancel; not really controls)

              Search extensions:
                [!]domainScope                               (domain scope)
                [!]mv=<filter>                               (matched values filter)
                [!]pr=<size>[/prompt|noprompt]       (paged results/prompt)
                [!]sss=[-]<attr[:OID]>[/[-]<attr[:OID]>...]  (server side sorting)
                [!]subentries[=true|false]           (subentries)
                [!]sync=ro[/<cookie>]                        (LDAP Sync refreshOnly)
                        rp[/<cookie>][/<slimit>]     (LDAP Sync refreshAndPersist)

       -I     Enable  SASL  Interactive  mode.   Always prompt.  Default is to
              prompt only as needed.

       -Q     Enable SASL Quiet mode.  Never prompt.

       -U authcid
              Specify the authentication ID for SASL bind. The form of the  ID
              depends on the actual SASL mechanism used.

       -R realm
              Specify  the  realm of authentication ID for SASL bind. The form
              of the realm depends on the actual SASL mechanism used.

       -X authzid
              Specify the requested authorization ID for SASL  bind.   authzid
              must be one of the following formats: dn:<distinguished name> or
              u:<username>

       -Y mech
              Specify the SASL mechanism to be  used  for  authentication.  If
              it's  not  specified, the program will choose the best mechanism
              the server knows.

       -Z[Z]  Issue StartTLS (Transport Layer Security) extended operation. If
              you  use  -ZZ, the command will require the operation to be suc-
              cessful.

INPUT FORMAT
       If the command-line arguments dn and rdn are given,  rdn  will  replace
       the RDN of the entry specified by the DN, dn.

       Otherwise,  the  contents  of  file (or standard input if no -f flag is
       given) should consist of one or more entries.

           Distinguished Name (DN)
           Relative Distinguished Name (RDN)

       One or more blank lines may be used to separate each DN/RDN pair.

EXAMPLE
       Assuming that the file /tmp/entrymods exists and has the contents:

           cn=Modify Me,dc=example,dc=com
           cn=The New Me

       the command:

           ldapmodrdn -r -f /tmp/entrymods

       will change the RDN of the "Modify Me" entry from "Modify Me"  to  "The
       New Me" and the old cn, "Modify Me" will be removed.


DIAGNOSTICS
       Exit  status is 0 if no errors occur.  Errors result in a non-zero exit
       status and a diagnostic message being written to standard error.
