syscallbypid.d(1m)               USER COMMANDS              syscallbypid.d(1m)



NAME
       syscallbypid.d - syscalls by process ID. Uses DTrace.

SYNOPSIS
       syscallbypid.d

DESCRIPTION
       This  reports the number of each type of system call made by PID.  This
       is useful to identify which process is causing the most system calls.

       This is based on a script from DExplorer.

       Since this uses DTrace, only users with root privileges  can  run  this
       command.

EXAMPLES
       This samples until Ctrl-C is hit.
              # syscallbypid.d


FIELDS
       PID    process ID

       CMD    process name

       SYSCALL
              system call name

       COUNT  number of system calls made in this sample


DOCUMENTATION
       See  the  DTraceToolkit for further documentation under the Docs direc-
       tory. The DTraceToolkit docs may include full worked examples with ver-
       bose descriptions explaining the output.

EXIT
       syscallbypid.d will sample until Ctrl-C is hit.
