NAME
     applesingle, binhex, macbinary -- encode and decode files

SYNOPSIS
     <tool> probe file ...
     <tool> [decode] [-c] [-fv] [-C dir] [-o outfile] [file ...]
     <tool> -h | -V

     applesingle encode [-cfv] [-s suf] [-C dir] [-o outfile] file ...
     binhex encode [-R] [-cfv] [-s suf] [-C dir] [-o outfile] file ...
     macbinary encode [-t 1-3] [-cfv] [-s suf] [-C dir] [-o outfile] file ...

DESCRIPTION
     applesingle, binhex, macbinary are implemented as a single tool with mul-
     tiple names.  All invocations support the three verbs encode, decode, and
     probe.

     If multiple files are passed to probe, the exit status will be non-zero
     only if all files contain data in the specified encoding.

OPTIONS
     -f, --force
              perform the operation even if the output file already exists

     -h, --help
              display version and usage, then quit

     -v, --verbose
              be verbose

     -V, --version
              display version, then quit

     -c, --pipe, --from-stdin, --to-stdout
              For decode, read encoded data from the standand input.  For
              encode, write encoded data to the standard output.  Currently,
              "plain" data must be written to and from specified filenames
              (see also mount_fdesc(8)).

     -C, --directory dir
              create output files in dir

     -o, --rename name
              Use name for output, overriding any stored or default name.  For
              encode, the appropriate suffix will be added to name.  -o
              implies only one file to be encoded or decoded.

     -s, --suffix .suf
              override the default suffix for the given encoding

     -R, --no-runlength-encoding
              don't use BinHex runlength compression when encoding

     -t, --type 1-3
              Specify MacBinary encoding type.  Type 1 is undesirable because
              it has neither a checksum nor a signature and is thus difficult
              to recognize.

DIAGNOSTICS
     In general, the tool returns a non-zero exit status if it fails.
