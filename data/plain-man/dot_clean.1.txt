DOT_CLEAN(1)              BSD General Commands Manual             DOT_CLEAN(1)

NAME
     dot_clean -- Merge ._* files with corresponding native files.

SYNOPSIS
     dot_clean [-fmnsv] [--keep=[mostrecent|dotbar|native]] [dir ...]

DESCRIPTION
     For each dir, dot_clean recursively merges all ._* files with their cor-
     responding native files according to the rules specified with the given
     arguments.  By default, if there is an attribute on the native file that
     is also present in the ._ file, the most recent attribute will be used.

     If no operands are given, a usage message is output.  If more than one
     directory is given, directories are merged in the order in which they are
     specified.

OPTIONS
     -f      Flat merge.  Do not recursively merge all directories in the
             given dir.  This is off by default.

     -h      Help. Prints verbose usage message.

     -m      Always delete dot underbar files.

     -n      Delete dot underbar file if there is no matching native file.

     -s      Follow symbolic links.  This will follow symbolic dot underbar
             files when they are found.

     -v      Print verbose output.

     --keep=mostrecent
             The default option.  If an attribute is associated with a data
             fork, use that.  Otherwise, use information stored in the Apple-
             Double file.  Note that the native fork's data is preferred even
             if the data in the AppleDouble file is newer.

     --keep=dotbar
             Always use information stored in the AppleDouble file, replacing
             any extended attributes associated with the native file.

     --keep=native
             Always use the information associated with the data fork, ignor-
             ing any AppleDouble files.

EXAMPLES
     The following is how to do an dot_clean merge on the mounted volume test,
     always using the dot underbar information.

           dot_clean --keep=dotbar /Volumes/test

DIAGNOSTICS
     The dot_clean utility exits 0 on success, and >0 if an error occurs.

BUGS
