LDAPURL(1)                                                          LDAPURL(1)



NAME
       ldapurl - LDAP URL formatting tool

SYNOPSIS
       ldapurl      [-a attrs]      [-b searchbase]     [-e [!]ext[=extparam]]
       [-E [!]ext[=extparam]] [-f filter] [-H ldapuri] [-h ldaphost] [-p ldap-
       port] [-s {base|one|sub|children}] [-S scheme]

DESCRIPTION
       ldapurl  is  a  command that allows to either compose or decompose LDAP
       URIs.

       When invoked with the -H option, ldapurl extracts the components of the
       ldapuri  option argument, unescaping hex-escaped chars as required.  It
       basically acts as a frontend to the ldap_url_parse(3) call.  Otherwise,
       it builds an LDAP URI based on the components passed with the appropri-
       ate options, performing the inverse operation.  Option -H is incompati-
       ble with options -a, -b, -E, -f, -H, -h, -p, -S, and -s.

OPTIONS
       -a attrs
              Set a comma-separated list of attribute selectors.

       -b searchbase
              Set the searchbase.

       -e [!]ext[=extparam]

       -E [!]ext[=extparam]

              Specify  general extensions with -e and search extensions
              with -E.  '!' indicates criticality.

              General extensions:
                [!]assert=<filter>   (an RFC 4515 Filter)
                [!]authzid=<authzid> ("dn:<dn>" or "u:<user>")
                [!]manageDSAit
                [!]noop
                ppolicy
                [!]postread[=<attrs>]        (a comma-separated attribute list)
                [!]preread[=<attrs>] (a comma-separated attribute list)
                abandon, cancel (SIGINT sends abandon/cancel; not really controls)

              Search extensions:
                [!]domainScope                               (domain scope)
                [!]mv=<filter>                               (matched values filter)
                [!]pr=<size>[/prompt|noprompt]       (paged results/prompt)
                [!]sss=[-]<attr[:OID]>[/[-]<attr[:OID]>...]  (server side sorting)
                [!]subentries[=true|false]           (subentries)
                [!]sync=ro[/<cookie>]                        (LDAP Sync refreshOnly)
                        rp[/<cookie>][/<slimit>]     (LDAP Sync refreshAndPersist)


       -f filter
              Set the URL filter.  No particular check  on  con-
              formity  with  RFC 4515 LDAP filters is performed,
              but the value is hex-escaped as required.

       -H ldapuri
              Specify URI to be exploded.

       -h ldaphost
              Set the host.

       -p ldapport
              Set the TCP port.

       -S scheme
              Set the URL scheme.  Defaults  for  other  fields,
              like  ldapport, may depend on the value of scheme.

       -s {base|one|sub|children}
              Specify the scope of the search to be one of base,
              one,  sub,  or  children to specify a base object,
              one-level,  subtree,  or  children  search.    The
              default  is  sub.   Note:  children scope requires
              LDAPv3 subordinate feature extension.


OUTPUT FORMAT
       If the  -H  option  is  used,  the  ldapuri  supplied  is
       exploded in its components, which are printed to standard
       output in an LDIF-like form.

       Otherwise, the URI built using the values passed with the
       other options is printed to standard output.

EXAMPLE
       The following command:

           ldapuri -h ldap.example.com -b dc=example,dc=com -s sub -f "(cn=Some One)"

       returns

           ldap://ldap.example.com:389/dc=example,dc=com??sub?(cn=Some%20One)

       The command:

           ldapuri -H ldap://ldap.example.com:389/dc=example,dc=com??sub?(cn=Some%20One)

       returns

           scheme: ldap
           host: ldap.example.com
           port: 389
           dn: dc=example,dc=com
           scope: sub
           filter: (cn=Some One)


DIAGNOSTICS
       Exit status is zero if no errors occur.  Errors result in
       a non-zero exit status and  a  diagnostic  message  being
       written to standard error.
