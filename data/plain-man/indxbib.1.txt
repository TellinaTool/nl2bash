NAME
       indxbib - make inverted index for bibliographic databases

SYNOPSIS
       indxbib [ -vw ] [ -cfile ] [ -ddir ] [ -ffile ] [ -hn ] [ -istring ]
               [ -kn ] [ -ln ] [ -nn ] [ -ofile ] [ -tn ] [ filename... ]

       It is possible to have whitespace between a command line option and its
       parameter.

DESCRIPTION
       indxbib  makes  an  inverted  index  for the bibliographic databases in
       filename...  for use with  refer(1),  lookbib(1),  and  lkbib(1).   The
       index  will  be  named  filename.i; the index is written to a temporary
       file which is then renamed to this.  If no filenames are given  on  the
       command  line  because the -f option has been used, and no -o option is
       given, the index will be named Ind.i.

       Bibliographic databases  are  divided  into  records  by  blank  lines.
       Within a record, each fields starts with a % character at the beginning
       of a line.  Fields have a one letter name which follows the  %  charac-
       ter.

       The  values  set  by  the  -c,  -n, -l and -t options are stored in the
       index; when the index is searched, keys will be discarded and truncated
       in  a  manner  appropriate  to these options; the original keys will be
       used for verifying that any record found using the index actually  con-
       tains  the  keys.   This  means  that  a user of an index need not know
       whether these options were used in the creation of the index,  provided
       that not all the keys to be searched for would have been discarded dur-
       ing indexing and that the user supplies at least the part of  each  key
       that  would  have  remained after being truncated during indexing.  The
       value set by the -i option is also stored in the index and will be used
       in verifying records found using the index.

OPTIONS
       -v     Print the version number.

       -w     Index whole files.  Each file is a separate record.

       -cfile Read   the   list   of   common   words  from  file  instead  of
              /usr/share/groff/1.19.2/eign.

       -ddir  Use dir as the pathname of  the  current  working  directory  to
              store in the index, instead of the path printed by pwd(1).  Usu-
              ally dir will be a symbolic link that points  to  the  directory
              printed by pwd(1).

       -ffile Read  the  files  to  be indexed from file.  If file is -, files
              will be read from the standard input.   The  -f  option  can  be
              given at most once.

       -istring
              Don't  index  the  contents of fields whose names are in string.
              Initially string is XYZ.

       -hn    Use the first prime greater than or equal to n for the  size  of
              the  hash table.  Larger values of n will usually make searching
              faster, but will make the index larger and indxbib use more mem-
              ory.  Initially n is 997.

       -kn    Use at most n keys per input record.  Initially n is 100.

       -ln    Discard keys that are shorter than n.  Initially n is 3.

       -nn    Discard the n most common words.  Initially n is 100.

       -obasename
              The index should be named basename.i.

       -tn    Truncate keys to n.  Initially n is 6.

FILES
       filename.i     Index.

       Ind.i          Default index name.

       /usr/share/groff/1.19.2/eign
                      List of common words.

       indxbibXXXXXX  Temporary file.
