rwbypid.d(1m)                    USER COMMANDS                   rwbypid.d(1m)



NAME
       rwbypid.d - read/write calls by PID. Uses DTrace.

SYNOPSIS
       rwbypid.d

DESCRIPTION
       This  script tracks the number of reads and writes at the syscall level
       by processes, printing the totals in a report. This matches  reads  and
       writes whether they succeed or not.

       Since  this  uses  DTrace, only users with root privileges can run this
       command.

EXAMPLES
       This samples until Ctrl-C is hit.
              # rwbypid.d


FIELDS
       PID    process ID

       CMD    process name

       DIR    direction, Read or Write

       COUNT  total calls


DOCUMENTATION
       See the DTraceToolkit for further documentation under the  Docs  direc-
       tory. The DTraceToolkit docs may include full worked examples with ver-
       bose descriptions explaining the output.

EXIT
       rwbypid.d will sample until Ctrl-C is hit.
