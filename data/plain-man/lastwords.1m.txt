lastwords(1m)                    USER COMMANDS                   lastwords(1m)



NAME
       lastwords - print syscalls before exit. Uses DTrace.

SYNOPSIS
       lastwords command

DESCRIPTION
       This  prints the last few system calls for processes matching the given
       name, when they exit. This makes use of  a  ring  buffer  so  that  the
       impact on the system is minimised.

       Since  this  uses  DTrace, only users with root privileges can run this
       command.

EXAMPLES
       Catch last few syscalls for dying netscape processes,
              # lastwords netscape


FIELDS
       TIME   time of syscall return, ns

       PID    process ID

       EXEC   process name (execname)

       SYSCALL
              system call

       RETURN return value for the system call

       ERR    errno for the system call


BASED ON
       /usr/demo/dtrace/ring.d
