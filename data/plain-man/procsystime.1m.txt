NAME
       procsystime - analyse system call times. Uses DTrace.

SYNOPSIS
       procsystime [-acehoT] [ -p PID | -n name | command ]

DESCRIPTION
       procsystime prints details on system call times for processes, both the
       elapsed times and on-cpu times can be printed.

       The elapsed times are interesting, to help identify syscalls that  take
       some  time  to  complete (during which the process may have slept). CPU
       time helps us identify syscalls that are consuming CPU cycles to run.

       Since this uses DTrace, only users with root privileges  can  run  this
       command.

OPTIONS
       -a     print all data

       -c     print syscall counts

       -e     print elapsed times, ns

       -o     print CPU times, ns

       -T     print totals

       -p PID examine this PID

       -n name
              examine processes which have this name

EXAMPLES
       Print elapsed times for PID 1871,
              # procsystime -p 1871


       Print elapsed times for processes called "tar",
              # procsystime -n tar


       Print CPU times for "tar" processes,
              # procsystime -on tar


       Print syscall counts for "tar" processes,
              # procsystime -cn tar


       Print elapsed and CPU times for "tar" processes,
              # procsystime -eon tar


       print all details for "bash" processes,
              # procsystime -aTn bash


       run and print details for "df -h",
              # procsystime df -h


FIELDS
       SYSCALL
              System call name

       TIME (ns)
              Total time, nanoseconds

       COUNT  Number of occurrences

DOCUMENTATION
       See  the  DTraceToolkit for further documentation under the Docs direc-
       tory. The DTraceToolkit docs may include full worked examples with ver-
       bose descriptions explaining the output.

EXIT
       procsystime will sample until Ctrl-C is hit.
