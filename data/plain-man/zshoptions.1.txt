ZSHOPTIONS(1)                                                    ZSHOPTIONS(1)



NAME
       zshoptions - zsh options

SPECIFYING OPTIONS
       Options are primarily referred to by name.  These names are case insen-
       sitive and underscores are ignored.  For example, `allexport' is equiv-
       alent to `A__lleXP_ort'.

       The  sense of an option name may be inverted by preceding it with `no',
       so `setopt No_Beep' is equivalent to `unsetopt beep'.   This  inversion
       can only be done once, so `nonobeep' is not a synonym for `beep'.  Sim-
       ilarly, `tify' is not  a  synonym  for  `nonotify'  (the  inversion  of
       `notify').

       Some  options also have one or more single letter names.  There are two
       sets of single letter options: one used by default, and another used to
       emulate  sh/ksh  (used  when the SH_OPTION_LETTERS option is set).  The
       single letter options can be used on the shell command  line,  or  with
       the  set, setopt and unsetopt builtins, as normal Unix options preceded
       by `-'.

       The sense of the single letter options may be  inverted  by  using  `+'
       instead  of  `-'.   Some  of the single letter option names refer to an
       option being off, in which case the inversion of that  name  refers  to
       the  option  being  on.  For example, `+n' is the short name of `exec',
       and `-n' is the short name of its inversion, `noexec'.

       In strings of single letter options supplied to the shell  at  startup,
       trailing  whitespace  will  be ignored; for example the string `-f    '
       will be treated just as `-f', but the string `-f i' is an error.   This
       is  because many systems which implement the `#!' mechanism for calling
       scripts do not strip trailing whitespace.


DESCRIPTION OF OPTIONS
       In the following list, options set by default  in  all  emulations  are
       marked  <D>;  those  set by default only in csh, ksh, sh, or zsh emula-
       tions are marked <C>, <K>,  <S>,  <Z>  as  appropriate.   When  listing
       options  (by  `setopt', `unsetopt', `set -o' or `set +o'), those turned
       on by default appear in the list prefixed  with  `no'.   Hence  (unless
       KSH_OPTION_PRINT is set), `setopt' shows all options whose settings are
       changed from the default.


   Changing Directories
       AUTO_CD (-J)
              If a command is issued that can't be executed as a  normal  com-
              mand, and the command is the name of a directory, perform the cd
              command to that directory.  This option is  only  applicable  if
              the  option  SHIN_STDIN  is set, i.e. if commands are being read
              from standard input.  The option  is  designed  for  interactive
              use;  it is recommended that cd be used explicitly in scripts to
              avoid ambiguity.

       AUTO_PUSHD (-N)
              Make cd push the old directory onto the directory stack.

       CDABLE_VARS (-T)
              If the argument to a cd command  (or  an  implied  cd  with  the
              AUTO_CD  option set) is not a directory, and does not begin with
              a slash, try to expand the expression as if it were preceded  by
              a `~' (see the section `Filename Expansion').

       CHASE_DOTS
              When  changing  to  a  directory  containing a path segment `..'
              which would otherwise be treated as canceling the previous  seg-
              ment in the path (in other words, `foo/..' would be removed from
              the path, or if `..' is the first part of  the  path,  the  last
              part of the current working directory would be removed), instead
              resolve the path to the  physical  directory.   This  option  is
              overridden by CHASE_LINKS.

              For  example,  suppose  /foo/bar  is  a  link  to  the directory
              /alt/rod.  Without this option set, `cd /foo/bar/..' changes  to
              /foo;  with it set, it changes to /alt.  The same applies if the
              current directory is /foo/bar and `cd ..' is  used.   Note  that
              all other symbolic links in the path will also be resolved.

       CHASE_LINKS (-w)
              Resolve symbolic links to their true values when changing direc-
              tory.  This also has the effect of CHASE_DOTS, i.e. a `..'  path
              segment  will  be  treated  as referring to the physical parent,
              even if the preceding path segment is a symbolic link.

       POSIX_CD
              Modifies the behaviour of cd, chdir and pushd commands  to  make
              them more compatible with the POSIX standard. The behaviour with
              the option unset is described in the documentation  for  the  cd
              builtin in zshbuiltins(1).  If the option is set, the shell does
              not test for directories beneath the local directory (`.') until
              after all directories in cdpath have been tested.

              Also, if the option is set, the conditions under which the shell
              prints the new directory after changing to it are modified.   It
              is no longer restricted to interactive shells (although printing
              of the directory stack with pushd is still limited  to  interac-
              tive  shells); and any use of a component of CDPATH, including a
              `.' but excluding an empty component that is  otherwise  treated
              as `.', causes the directory to be printed.

       PUSHD_IGNORE_DUPS
              Don't push multiple copies of the same directory onto the direc-
              tory stack.

       PUSHD_MINUS
              Exchanges the meanings of `+' and `-' when used with a number to
              specify a directory in the stack.

       PUSHD_SILENT (-E)
              Do not print the directory stack after pushd or popd.

       PUSHD_TO_HOME (-D)
              Have pushd with no arguments act like `pushd $HOME'.


   Completion
       ALWAYS_LAST_PROMPT <D>
              If  unset,  key functions that list completions try to return to
              the last prompt if given a numeric argument. If set these  func-
              tions try to return to the last prompt if given no numeric argu-
              ment.

       ALWAYS_TO_END
              If a completion is performed with the cursor within a word,  and
              a full completion is inserted, the cursor is moved to the end of
              the word.  That is, the cursor is moved to the end of  the  word
              if  either a single match is inserted or menu completion is per-
              formed.

       AUTO_LIST (-9) <D>
              Automatically list choices on an ambiguous completion.

       AUTO_MENU <D>
              Automatically use menu completion after the  second  consecutive
              request  for  completion,  for  example  by pressing the tab key
              repeatedly. This option is overridden by MENU_COMPLETE.

       AUTO_NAME_DIRS
              Any parameter that is set to the absolute name  of  a  directory
              immediately becomes a name for that directory, that will be used
              by the `%~' and related prompt sequences, and will be  available
              when completion is performed on a word starting with `~'.  (Oth-
              erwise, the parameter must be used in the form `~param'  first.)

       AUTO_PARAM_KEYS <D>
              If  a  parameter  name  was  completed and a following character
              (normally a space) automatically inserted, and the next  charac-
              ter  typed  is one of those that have to come directly after the
              name (like `}', `:', etc.), the automatically added character is
              deleted, so that the character typed comes immediately after the
              parameter name.  Completion in a  brace  expansion  is  affected
              similarly:  the  added character is a `,', which will be removed
              if `}' is typed next.

       AUTO_PARAM_SLASH <D>
              If a parameter is completed whose  content  is  the  name  of  a
              directory, then add a trailing slash instead of a space.

       AUTO_REMOVE_SLASH <D>
              When  the  last character resulting from a completion is a slash
              and the next character typed is a word delimiter, a slash, or  a
              character  that ends a command (such as a semicolon or an amper-
              sand), remove the slash.

       BASH_AUTO_LIST
              On an ambiguous completion, automatically list choices when  the
              completion  function  is called twice in succession.  This takes
              precedence over AUTO_LIST.  The  setting  of  LIST_AMBIGUOUS  is
              respected.   If  AUTO_MENU  is set, the menu behaviour will then
              start with the third press.  Note that this will not  work  with
              MENU_COMPLETE, since repeated completion calls immediately cycle
              through the list in that case.

       COMPLETE_ALIASES
              Prevents aliases on the command line from being internally  sub-
              stituted  before completion is attempted.  The effect is to make
              the alias a distinct command for completion purposes.

       COMPLETE_IN_WORD
              If unset, the cursor is set to the end of the word if completion
              is started. Otherwise it stays there and completion is done from
              both ends.

       GLOB_COMPLETE
              When the current word has a glob pattern, do not insert all  the
              words  resulting  from the expansion but generate matches as for
              completion  and  cycle  through  them  like  MENU_COMPLETE.  The
              matches  are  generated  as if a `*' was added to the end of the
              word, or inserted at the cursor when  COMPLETE_IN_WORD  is  set.
              This  actually  uses pattern matching, not globbing, so it works
              not only for files but for any completion, such as options, user
              names, etc.

              Note  that  when  the  pattern matcher is used, matching control
              (for example, case-insensitive or anchored matching)  cannot  be
              used.   This  limitation only applies when the current word con-
              tains a pattern; simply turning on the GLOB_COMPLETE option does
              not have this effect.

       HASH_LIST_ALL <D>
              Whenever   a   command  completion  or  spelling  correction  is
              attempted, make sure the entire command path  is  hashed  first.
              This  makes the first completion slower but avoids false reports
              of spelling errors.

       LIST_AMBIGUOUS <D>
              This option works when AUTO_LIST or BASH_AUTO_LIST is also  set.
              If there is an unambiguous prefix to insert on the command line,
              that is done without a completion list being displayed; in other
              words,  auto-listing  behaviour  only  takes  place when nothing
              would be inserted.  In the case of  BASH_AUTO_LIST,  this  means
              that the list will be delayed to the third call of the function.

       LIST_BEEP <D>
              Beep on an ambiguous completion.  More accurately,  this  forces
              the  completion  widgets to return status 1 on an ambiguous com-
              pletion, which causes the shell to beep if the  option  BEEP  is
              also  set;  this  may be modified if completion is called from a
              user-defined widget.

       LIST_PACKED
              Try to make the completion list smaller (occupying  less  lines)
              by printing the matches in columns with different widths.

       LIST_ROWS_FIRST
              Lay  out  the  matches  in completion lists sorted horizontally,
              that is, the second match is to the right of the first one,  not
              under it as usual.

       LIST_TYPES (-X) <D>
              When  listing files that are possible completions, show the type
              of each file with a trailing identifying mark.

       MENU_COMPLETE (-Y)
              On an ambiguous completion, instead of listing possibilities  or
              beeping,  insert the first match immediately.  Then when comple-
              tion is requested again, remove the first match and  insert  the
              second  match,  etc.  When there are no more matches, go back to
              the first one again.  reverse-menu-complete may be used to  loop
              through  the  list in the other direction. This option overrides
              AUTO_MENU.

       REC_EXACT (-S)
              In completion, recognize exact matches even if they are  ambigu-
              ous.


   Expansion and Globbing
       BAD_PATTERN (+2) <C> <Z>
              If  a  pattern for filename generation is badly formed, print an
              error message.  (If this option is unset, the  pattern  will  be
              left unchanged.)

       BARE_GLOB_QUAL <Z>
              In  a  glob  pattern,  treat  a trailing set of parentheses as a
              qualifier list, if it contains no `|', `(' or (if  special)  `~'
              characters.  See the section `Filename Generation'.

       BRACE_CCL
              Expand  expressions  in braces which would not otherwise undergo
              brace expansion to a lexically ordered list of all  the  charac-
              ters.  See the section `Brace Expansion'.

       CASE_GLOB <D>
              Make  globbing  (filename  generation)  sensitive to case.  Note
              that other uses of patterns are always sensitive  to  case.   If
              the option is unset, the presence of any character which is spe-
              cial to filename generation will cause  case-insensitive  match-
              ing.   For  example, cvs(/) can match the directory CVS owing to
              the  presence  of  the  globbing   flag   (unless   the   option
              BARE_GLOB_QUAL is unset).

       CASE_MATCH <D>
              Make  regular  expressions using the zsh/regex module (including
              matches with =~) sensitive to case.

       CSH_NULL_GLOB <C>
              If a pattern for filename generation has no matches, delete  the
              pattern  from  the  argument list; do not report an error unless
              all the patterns  in  a  command  have  no  matches.   Overrides
              NOMATCH.

       EQUALS <Z>
              Perform = filename expansion.  (See the section `Filename Expan-
              sion'.)

       EXTENDED_GLOB
              Treat the `#', `~' and `^' characters as part  of  patterns  for
              filename  generation, etc.  (An initial unquoted `~' always pro-
              duces named directory expansion.)

       FORCE_FLOAT
              Constants in arithmetic evaluation will be treated  as  floating
              point  even  without  the  use of a decimal point; the values of
              integer variables will be converted to floating point when  used
              in  arithmetic  expressions.   Integers in any base will be con-
              verted.

       GLOB (+F, ksh: +f) <D>
              Perform filename generation (globbing).  (See the section `File-
              name Generation'.)

       GLOB_ASSIGN <C>
              If  this  option  is set, filename generation (globbing) is per-
              formed on the right hand side of scalar parameter assignments of
              the  form  `name=pattern (e.g. `foo=*').  If the result has more
              than one word the parameter will  become  an  array  with  those
              words  as  arguments. This option is provided for backwards com-
              patibility only: globbing is always performed on the right  hand
              side  of  array  assignments  of  the  form `name=(value)' (e.g.
              `foo=(*)') and this form is recommended for clarity;  with  this
              option  set,  it  is  not possible to predict whether the result
              will be an array or a scalar.

       GLOB_DOTS (-4)
              Do not require a leading `.' in a filename to be matched explic-
              itly.

       GLOB_SUBST <C> <K> <S>
              Treat any characters resulting from parameter expansion as being
              eligible for filename expansion and filename generation, and any
              characters resulting from command substitution as being eligible
              for filename generation.  Braces (and commas in between) do  not
              become eligible for expansion.

       HIST_SUBST_PATTERN
              Substitutions  using  the  :s  and :& history modifiers are per-
              formed with pattern matching instead of string  matching.   This
              occurs  wherever  history  modifiers  are  valid, including glob
              qualifiers and parameters.  See the section  Modifiers  in  zsh-
              expn(1).

       IGNORE_BRACES (-I) <S>
              Do  not  perform  brace  expansion.  For historical reasons this
              also includes the effect of the IGNORE_CLOSE_BRACES option.

       IGNORE_CLOSE_BRACES
              When neither this option nor IGNORE_BRACES is set, a sole  close
              brace character `}' is syntactically significant at any point on
              a command line.  This has the effect that no semicolon  or  new-
              line  is  necessary  before  the brace terminating a function or
              current shell construct.  When either option is set,  a  closing
              brace  is  syntactically  significant  only in command position.
              Unlike IGNORE_BRACES, this option does not disable brace  expan-
              sion.

              For  example,  with both options unset a function may be defined
              in the following fashion:

                     args() { echo $# }

              while if either option is set, this does not work and  something
              equivalent to the following is required:

                     args() { echo $#; }


       KSH_GLOB <K>
              In  pattern  matching,  the  interpretation  of  parentheses  is
              affected by a preceding `@', `*', `+', `?' or `!'.  See the sec-
              tion `Filename Generation'.

       MAGIC_EQUAL_SUBST
              All unquoted arguments of the form `anything=expression' appear-
              ing after the command name have  filename  expansion  (that  is,
              where  expression has a leading `~' or `=') performed on expres-
              sion as if it were a parameter assignment.  The argument is  not
              otherwise  treated  specially;  it is passed to the command as a
              single argument, and not used as an actual parameter assignment.
              For  example,  in  echo  foo=~/bar:~/rod,  both occurrences of ~
              would be replaced.  Note that this happens anyway  with  typeset
              and similar statements.

              This  option respects the setting of the KSH_TYPESET option.  In
              other words, if both options are in  effect,  arguments  looking
              like assignments will not undergo word splitting.

       MARK_DIRS (-8, ksh: -X)
              Append  a  trailing  `/'  to  all directory names resulting from
              filename generation (globbing).

       MULTIBYTE <C> <K> <Z>
              Respect multibyte characters when found in strings.   When  this
              option  is set, strings are examined using the system library to
              determine how many bytes form a character, depending on the cur-
              rent  locale.   This  affects  the way characters are counted in
              pattern matching, parameter values and various delimiters.

              The option is on by default  if  the  shell  was  compiled  with
              MULTIBYTE_SUPPORT except in sh emulation; otherwise it is off by
              default and has no effect if turned on.  The mode is off  in  sh
              emulation  for compatibility but for interactive use may need to
              be turned on if the terminal interprets multibyte characters.

              If the option is off a single byte is always treated as a single
              character.   This  setting  is  designed  purely  for  examining
              strings known to contain raw bytes or other values that may  not
              be  characters  in  the  current locale.  It is not necessary to
              unset the option merely because the character set for  the  cur-
              rent locale does not contain multibyte characters.

              The  option  does  not  affect the shell's editor,  which always
              uses the locale to  determine  multibyte  characters.   This  is
              because  the character set displayed by the terminal emulator is
              independent of shell settings.

       NOMATCH (+3) <C> <Z>
              If a pattern for filename generation has no  matches,  print  an
              error,  instead  of  leaving  it unchanged in the argument list.
              This also applies to file expansion of an initial `~' or `='.

       NULL_GLOB (-G)
              If a pattern for filename generation has no matches, delete  the
              pattern  from  the  argument list instead of reporting an error.
              Overrides NOMATCH.

       NUMERIC_GLOB_SORT
              If numeric filenames are matched by a filename  generation  pat-
              tern,  sort  the filenames numerically rather than lexicographi-
              cally.

       RC_EXPAND_PARAM (-P)
              Array expansions of the form `foo${xx}bar', where the  parameter
              xx  is  set  to  (a  b c), are substituted with `fooabar foobbar
              foocbar' instead of the default `fooa b  cbar'.   Note  that  an
              empty array will therefore cause all arguments to be removed.

       REMATCH_PCRE <Z>
              If  set,  regular  expression matching with the =~ operator will
              use Perl-Compatible Regular Expressions from the  PCRE  library,
              if  available.   If  not  set,  regular expressions will use the
              extended regexp syntax provided by the system libraries.

       SH_GLOB <K> <S>
              Disables the special meaning of `(', `|', `)' and '<' for  glob-
              bing  the  result of parameter and command substitutions, and in
              some other places where the shell accepts patterns.  If  SH_GLOB
              is  set but KSH_GLOB is not, the shell allows the interpretation
              of subshell expressions enclosed in parentheses  in  some  cases
              where  there  is  no  space before the opening parenthesis, e.g.
              !(true) is interpreted as if there were a  space  after  the  !.
              This option is set by default if zsh is invoked as sh or ksh.

       UNSET (+u, ksh: +u) <K> <S> <Z>
              Treat  unset parameters as if they were empty when substituting.
              Otherwise they are treated as an error.

       WARN_CREATE_GLOBAL
              Print a warning message when a global parameter is created in  a
              function  by an assignment.  This often indicates that a parame-
              ter has not been  declared  local  when  it  should  have  been.
              Parameters  explicitly  declared  global  from within a function
              using typeset -g do not cause a warning.  Note that there is  no
              warning  when a local parameter is assigned to in a nested func-
              tion, which may also indicate an error.


   History
       APPEND_HISTORY <D>
              If this is set, zsh sessions will append their history  list  to
              the  history file, rather than replace it. Thus, multiple paral-
              lel zsh sessions will all have the new entries from  their  his-
              tory  lists  added  to  the history file, in the order that they
              exit.  The file will still be periodically re-written to trim it
              when the number of lines grows 20% beyond the value specified by
              $SAVEHIST (see also the HIST_SAVE_BY_COPY option).

       BANG_HIST (+K) <C> <Z>
              Perform textual history expansion, csh-style, treating the char-
              acter `!' specially.

       EXTENDED_HISTORY <C>
              Save  each  command's  beginning timestamp (in seconds since the
              epoch) and the duration (in seconds) to the history  file.   The
              format of this prefixed data is:

              `: <beginning time>:<elapsed seconds>;<command>'.

       HIST_ALLOW_CLOBBER
              Add `|' to output redirections in the history.  This allows his-
              tory references to clobber files even when CLOBBER is unset.

       HIST_BEEP <D>
              Beep in ZLE when a widget attempts to  access  a  history  entry
              which isn't there.

       HIST_EXPIRE_DUPS_FIRST
              If  the  internal history needs to be trimmed to add the current
              command line, setting this option will cause the oldest  history
              event  that  has  a  duplicate to be lost before losing a unique
              event from the list.  You should be sure to  set  the  value  of
              HISTSIZE  to  a larger number than SAVEHIST in order to give you
              some room for the duplicated events, otherwise this option  will
              behave  just like HIST_IGNORE_ALL_DUPS once the history fills up
              with unique events.

       HIST_FCNTL_LOCK
              When writing out the history file, by default  zsh  uses  ad-hoc
              file  locking to avoid known problems with locking on some oper-
              ating systems.  With this option locking is done by means of the
              system's  fcntl call, where this method is available.  On recent
              operating systems this may provide better performance,  in  par-
              ticular  avoiding  history  corruption  when files are stored on
              NFS.

       HIST_FIND_NO_DUPS
              When searching for history entries in the line  editor,  do  not
              display  duplicates  of  a  line  previously  found, even if the
              duplicates are not contiguous.

       HIST_IGNORE_ALL_DUPS
              If a new command line being added to the history list duplicates
              an  older  one, the older command is removed from the list (even
              if it is not the previous event).

       HIST_IGNORE_DUPS (-h)
              Do not enter command lines into the history  list  if  they  are
              duplicates of the previous event.

       HIST_IGNORE_SPACE (-g)
              Remove  command lines from the history list when the first char-
              acter on the line is a  space,  or  when  one  of  the  expanded
              aliases  contains  a  leading  space.   Only normal aliases (not
              global or suffix aliases) have this behaviour.   Note  that  the
              command  lingers  in the internal history until the next command
              is entered before it vanishes, allowing you to briefly reuse  or
              edit the line.  If you want to make it vanish right away without
              entering another command, type a space and press return.

       HIST_LEX_WORDS
              By default, shell history that is read in from  files  is  split
              into  words  on all white space.  This means that arguments with
              quoted whitespace are not correctly  handled,  with  the  conse-
              quence  that references to words in history lines that have been
              read from a file may be inaccurate.  When this  option  is  set,
              words  read  in  from a history file are divided up in a similar
              fashion to normal shell command line  handling.   Although  this
              produces  more  accurately  delimited  words, if the size of the
              history file is large this can be slow.  Trial and error is nec-
              essary to decide.

       HIST_NO_FUNCTIONS
              Remove  function  definitions  from the history list.  Note that
              the function lingers in the internal history until the next com-
              mand  is entered before it vanishes, allowing you to briefly re-
              use or edit the definition.

       HIST_NO_STORE
              Remove the history (fc -l) command from the  history  list  when
              invoked.   Note that the command lingers in the internal history
              until the next command is entered before it  vanishes,  allowing
              you to briefly reuse or edit the line.

       HIST_REDUCE_BLANKS
              Remove  superfluous blanks from each command line being added to
              the history list.

       HIST_SAVE_BY_COPY <D>
              When the history file is re-written, we  normally  write  out  a
              copy of the file named $HISTFILE.new and then rename it over the
              old one.  However, if this option is unset, we instead  truncate
              the old history file and write out the new version in-place.  If
              one of the history-appending options  is  enabled,  this  option
              only  has  an  effect when the enlarged history file needs to be
              re-written to trim it down to size.  Disable this  only  if  you
              have  special  needs, as doing so makes it possible to lose his-
              tory entries if zsh gets interrupted during the save.

              When writing out a copy of the history file, zsh  preserves  the
              old file's permissions and group information, but will refuse to
              write out a new file if  it  would  change  the  history  file's
              owner.

       HIST_SAVE_NO_DUPS
              When writing out the history file, older commands that duplicate
              newer ones are omitted.

       HIST_VERIFY
              Whenever the user enters a line with  history  expansion,  don't
              execute  the  line  directly; instead, perform history expansion
              and reload the line into the editing buffer.

       INC_APPEND_HISTORY
              This options works like APPEND_HISTORY except that  new  history
              lines  are added to the $HISTFILE incrementally (as soon as they
              are entered), rather than waiting until the  shell  exits.   The
              file  will  still be periodically re-written to trim it when the
              number of lines grows 20% beyond the value specified  by  $SAVE-
              HIST (see also the HIST_SAVE_BY_COPY option).

       INC_APPEND_HISTORY_TIME
              This  option  is a variant of INC_APPEND_HISTORY in which, where
              possible, the history entry is written out to the file after the
              command  is  finished,  so that the time taken by the command is
              recorded correctly in the history file in EXTENDED_HISTORY  for-
              mat.   This  means  that the history entry will not be available
              immediately from other instances of the shell that are using the
              same history file.

              This  option is only useful if INC_APPEND_HISTORY and SHARE_HIS-
              TORY are turned off.  The three  options  should  be  considered
              mutually exclusive.

       SHARE_HISTORY <K>

              This option both imports new commands from the history file, and
              also causes your typed commands to be appended  to  the  history
              file  (the  latter  is like specifying INC_APPEND_HISTORY, which
              should be turned off if this option is in effect).  The  history
              lines  are  also  output  with  timestamps  ala EXTENDED_HISTORY
              (which makes it easier to find the spot where we left off  read-
              ing the file after it gets re-written).

              By  default,  history movement commands visit the imported lines
              as well as the local lines, but you can toggle this on  and  off
              with  the set-local-history zle binding.  It is also possible to
              create a zle widget that will make some commands ignore imported
              commands, and some include them.

              If  you  find  that you want more control over when commands get
              imported,   you   may   wish   to   turn   SHARE_HISTORY    off,
              INC_APPEND_HISTORY  or  INC_APPEND_HISTORY_TIME  (see above) on,
              and then manually import commands whenever you need  them  using
              `fc -RI'.


   Initialisation
       ALL_EXPORT (-a, ksh: -a)
              All  parameters subsequently defined are automatically exported.

       GLOBAL_EXPORT <Z>
              If this option is set, passing  the  -x  flag  to  the  builtins
              declare,  float,  integer,  readonly and typeset (but not local)
              will also set the -g flag;  hence  parameters  exported  to  the
              environment  will  not  be made local to the enclosing function,
              unless they were already or the flag +g is given explicitly.  If
              the  option  is unset, exported parameters will be made local in
              just the same way as any other parameter.

              This option is set by default for backward compatibility; it  is
              not  recommended  that  its behaviour be relied upon.  Note that
              the builtin export always sets both the -x  and  -g  flags,  and
              hence its effect extends beyond the scope of the enclosing func-
              tion; this is the most portable way to achieve this behaviour.

       GLOBAL_RCS (-d) <D>
              If this  option  is  unset,  the  startup  files  /etc/zprofile,
              /etc/zshrc,  /etc/zlogin  and  /etc/zlogout will not be run.  It
              can be disabled and re-enabled at  any  time,  including  inside
              local startup files (.zshrc, etc.).

       RCS (+f) <D>
              After  /etc/zshenv  is  sourced  on startup, source the .zshenv,
              /etc/zprofile, .zprofile, /etc/zshrc, .zshrc, /etc/zlogin, .zlo-
              gin,  and  .zlogout  files, as described in the section `Files'.
              If this option is unset, the /etc/zshenv file is still  sourced,
              but  any of the others will not be; it can be set at any time to
              prevent the remaining startup files after the currently  execut-
              ing one from being sourced.


   Input/Output
       ALIASES <D>
              Expand aliases.

       CLOBBER (+C, ksh: +C) <D>
              Allows  `>'  redirection to truncate existing files, and `>>' to
              create files.  Otherwise `>!' or `>|' must be used to truncate a
              file, and `>>!' or `>>|' to create a file.

       CORRECT (-0)
              Try  to  correct  the spelling of commands.  Note that, when the
              HASH_LIST_ALL option is not set or when some directories in  the
              path  are  not readable, this may falsely report spelling errors
              the first time some commands are used.

              The shell variable CORRECT_IGNORE may be set  to  a  pattern  to
              match words that will never be offered as corrections.

       CORRECT_ALL (-O)
              Try to correct the spelling of all arguments in a line.

              The  shell  variable CORRECT_IGNORE_FILE may be set to a pattern
              to match file names that will never be offered as corrections.

       DVORAK Use the Dvorak keyboard instead of the standard qwerty  keyboard
              as  a  basis for examining spelling mistakes for the CORRECT and
              CORRECT_ALL options and the spell-word editor command.

       FLOW_CONTROL <D>
              If this option is unset,  output  flow  control  via  start/stop
              characters  (usually  assigned  to  ^S/^Q)  is  disabled  in the
              shell's editor.

       IGNORE_EOF (-7)
              Do not exit on end-of-file.  Require the use of exit  or  logout
              instead.   However, ten consecutive EOFs will cause the shell to
              exit anyway, to avoid the shell hanging if its tty goes away.

              Also, if this option is set and the Zsh  Line  Editor  is  used,
              widgets implemented by shell functions can be bound to EOF (nor-
              mally Control-D) without printing the  normal  warning  message.
              This  works only for normal widgets, not for completion widgets.

       INTERACTIVE_COMMENTS (-k) <K> <S>
              Allow comments even in interactive shells.

       HASH_CMDS <D>
              Note the location of each command the first time it is executed.
              Subsequent  invocations  of  the same command will use the saved
              location, avoiding a path search.  If this option is  unset,  no
              path hashing is done at all.  However, when CORRECT is set, com-
              mands whose names do not appear in the functions or aliases hash
              tables  are  hashed in order to avoid reporting them as spelling
              errors.

       HASH_DIRS <D>
              Whenever a command name is hashed, hash the directory containing
              it,  as  well as all directories that occur earlier in the path.
              Has no effect if neither HASH_CMDS nor CORRECT is set.

       HASH_EXECUTABLES_ONLY
              When hashing commands because of HASH_CMDS, check that the  file
              to be hashed is actually an executable.  This option is unset by
              default as if the path contains a large number of  commands,  or
              consists  of  many remote files, the additional tests can take a
              long time.  Trial and error is needed to show if this option  is
              beneficial.

       MAIL_WARNING (-U)
              Print  a  warning message if a mail file has been accessed since
              the shell last checked.

       PATH_DIRS (-Q)
              Perform a path search even on  command  names  with  slashes  in
              them.  Thus if `/usr/local/bin' is in the user's path, and he or
              she types `X11/xinit',  the  command  `/usr/local/bin/X11/xinit'
              will  be  executed  (assuming  it  exists).  Commands explicitly
              beginning with `/', `./' or `../' are not subject  to  the  path
              search.  This also applies to the `.' and source builtins.

              Note  that  subdirectories  of  the current directory are always
              searched for executables specified in  this  form.   This  takes
              place before any search indicated by this option, and regardless
              of whether `.' or the current directory appear  in  the  command
              search path.

       PATH_SCRIPT <K> <S>
              If  this  option  is  not  set,  a  script  passed  as the first
              non-option argument to the shell must contain the  name  of  the
              file  to  open.   If this option is set, and the script does not
              specify a directory path, the script is looked for first in  the
              current  directory,  then  in the command path.  See the section
              INVOCATION in zsh(1).

       PRINT_EIGHT_BIT
              Print eight bit characters literally in completion  lists,  etc.
              This  option  is  not necessary if your system correctly returns
              the printability of eight bit characters (see ctype(3)).

       PRINT_EXIT_VALUE (-1)
              Print the exit value of  programs  with  non-zero  exit  status.
              This  is  only  available  at  the  command  line in interactive
              shells.

       RC_QUOTES
              Allow the character sequence `'''  to  signify  a  single  quote
              within  singly  quoted  strings.   Note  this  does not apply in
              quoted strings using the format $'...', where a backslashed sin-
              gle quote can be used.

       RM_STAR_SILENT (-H) <K> <S>
              Do not query the user before executing `rm *' or `rm path/*'.

       RM_STAR_WAIT
              If  querying  the  user  before executing `rm *' or `rm path/*',
              first wait ten seconds and ignore anything typed in  that  time.
              This  avoids  the  problem of reflexively answering `yes' to the
              query when one didn't really mean it.  The wait  and  query  can
              always be avoided by expanding the `*' in ZLE (with tab).

       SHORT_LOOPS <C> <Z>
              Allow  the  short forms of for, repeat, select, if, and function
              constructs.

       SUN_KEYBOARD_HACK (-L)
              If a line ends with a backquote, and there are an odd number  of
              backquotes  on the line, ignore the trailing backquote.  This is
              useful on some keyboards where the return key is too small,  and
              the  backquote  key lies annoyingly close to it.  As an alterna-
              tive the variable KEYBOARD_HACK lets you choose the character to
              be removed.


   Job Control
       AUTO_CONTINUE
              With this option set, stopped jobs that are removed from the job
              table with the disown builtin command are automatically  sent  a
              CONT signal to make them running.

       AUTO_RESUME (-W)
              Treat  single word simple commands without redirection as candi-
              dates for resumption of an existing job.

       BG_NICE (-6) <C> <Z>
              Run all background jobs at a lower priority.  This option is set
              by default.

       CHECK_JOBS <Z>
              Report  the status of background and suspended jobs before exit-
              ing a shell with job control; a second attempt to exit the shell
              will  succeed.   NO_CHECK_JOBS  is best used only in combination
              with NO_HUP, else such jobs will be killed automatically.

              The check is omitted if the commands run from the previous  com-
              mand  line  included  a  `jobs' command, since it is assumed the
              user is aware that there are background or  suspended  jobs.   A
              `jobs' command run from one of the hook functions defined in the
              section SPECIAL FUNCTIONS in zshmisc(1) is not counted for  this
              purpose.

       HUP <Z>
              Send the HUP signal to running jobs when the shell exits.

       LONG_LIST_JOBS (-R)
              List jobs in the long format by default.

       MONITOR (-m, ksh: -m)
              Allow job control.  Set by default in interactive shells.

       NOTIFY (-5, ksh: -b) <Z>
              Report  the  status  of background jobs immediately, rather than
              waiting until just before printing a prompt.

       POSIX_JOBS <K> <S>
              This option makes job control  more  compliant  with  the  POSIX
              standard.

              When the option is not set, the MONITOR option is unset on entry
              to subshells, so that job control is no longer active.  When the
              option  is set, the MONITOR option and job control remain active
              in the subshell, but note that the subshell  has  no  access  to
              jobs in the parent shell.

              When  the option is not set, jobs put in the background or fore-
              ground with bg or fg are displayed  with  the  same  information
              that  would  be  reported by jobs.  When the option is set, only
              the text is  printed.   The  output  from  jobs  itself  is  not
              affected by the option.

              When  the  option  is  not  set, job information from the parent
              shell is saved for output within a subshell (for example, within
              a  pipeline).   When  the  option  is set, the output of jobs is
              empty until a job is started within the subshell.

              In previous versions of the shell, it was  necessary  to  enable
              POSIX_JOBS  in  order for the builtin command wait to return the
              status of background jobs that had already exited.  This  is  no
              longer the case.


   Prompting
       PROMPT_BANG <K>
              If  set,  `!'  is  treated  specially  in prompt expansion.  See
              EXPANSION OF PROMPT SEQUENCES in zshmisc(1).

       PROMPT_CR (+V) <D>
              Print a carriage return just before printing  a  prompt  in  the
              line  editor.   This  is  on by default as multi-line editing is
              only possible if the editor knows where the start  of  the  line
              appears.

       PROMPT_SP <D>
              Attempt to preserve a partial line (i.e. a line that did not end
              with a newline) that would otherwise be covered up by  the  com-
              mand  prompt  due  to  the PROMPT_CR option.  This works by out-
              putting some cursor-control characters, including  a  series  of
              spaces, that should make the terminal wrap to the next line when
              a partial line is present (note that this is only successful  if
              your terminal has automatic margins, which is typical).

              When  a  partial  line  is preserved, by default you will see an
              inverse+bold character at the end of the partial  line:   a  `%'
              for  a normal user or a `#' for root.  If set, the shell parame-
              ter PROMPT_EOL_MARK can be used to customize how the end of par-
              tial lines are shown.

              NOTE:  if  the PROMPT_CR option is not set, enabling this option
              will have no effect.  This option is on by default.

       PROMPT_PERCENT <C> <Z>
              If set, `%' is  treated  specially  in  prompt  expansion.   See
              EXPANSION OF PROMPT SEQUENCES in zshmisc(1).

       PROMPT_SUBST <K> <S>
              If set, parameter expansion, command substitution and arithmetic
              expansion  are  performed  in  prompts.   Substitutions   within
              prompts do not affect the command status.

       TRANSIENT_RPROMPT
              Remove  any  right  prompt from display when accepting a command
              line.  This may be useful with terminals  with  other  cut/paste
              methods.


   Scripts and Functions
       C_BASES
              Output hexadecimal numbers in the standard C format, for example
              `0xFF' instead of the usual `16#FF'.  If the option OCTAL_ZEROES
              is  also  set  (it  is  not  by  default), octal numbers will be
              treated similarly and hence appear as `077' instead  of  `8#77'.
              This  option has no effect on the choice of the output base, nor
              on the output of bases other than hexadecimal and  octal.   Note
              that  these  formats will be understood on input irrespective of
              the setting of C_BASES.

       C_PRECEDENCES
              This alters the precedence of arithmetic operators  to  be  more
              like  C  and other programming languages; the section ARITHMETIC
              EVALUATION in zshmisc(1) has an explicit list.

       DEBUG_BEFORE_CMD
              Run the DEBUG trap before each  command;  otherwise  it  is  run
              after each command.  Setting this option mimics the behaviour of
              ksh 93; with the option unset the behaviour is that of ksh 88.

       ERR_EXIT (-e, ksh: -e)
              If a command has a non-zero exit status, execute the ZERR  trap,
              if set, and exit.  This is disabled while running initialization
              scripts.

              The behaviour is also disabled inside DEBUG traps.  In this case
              the  option  is  handled  specially: it is unset on entry to the
              trap.  If the option  DEBUG_BEFORE_CMD  is  set,  as  it  is  by
              default,  and  the  option ERR_EXIT is found to have been set on
              exit, then the command for which the DEBUG trap  is  being  exe-
              cuted  is skipped.  The option is restored after the trap exits.

              Exiting due to ERR_EXIT has certain interactions with  asynchro-
              nous jobs noted in the section JOBS in in zshmisc(1).

       ERR_RETURN
              If a command has a non-zero exit status, return immediately from
              the enclosing function.  The logic  is  identical  to  that  for
              ERR_EXIT,  except  that an implicit return statement is executed
              instead of an exit.  This will trigger an exit at the  outermost
              level of a non-interactive script.

       EVAL_LINENO <Z>
              If  set, line numbers of expressions evaluated using the builtin
              eval are tracked separately of the enclosing environment.   This
              applies  both to the parameter LINENO and the line number output
              by the prompt escape %i.  If  the  option  is  set,  the  prompt
              escape  %N will output the string `(eval)' instead of the script
              or function name as an indication.   (The two prompt escapes are
              typically used in the parameter PS4 to be output when the option
              XTRACE is set.)  If EVAL_LINENO is unset, the line number of the
              surrounding  script  or  function is retained during the evalua-
              tion.

       EXEC (+n, ksh: +n) <D>
              Do execute commands.  Without this option, commands are read and
              checked for syntax errors, but not executed.  This option cannot
              be turned off in an interactive shell, except when `-n' is  sup-
              plied to the shell at startup.

       FUNCTION_ARGZERO <C> <Z>
              When  executing  a  shell  function or sourcing a script, set $0
              temporarily to the name of the function/script.  Note that  tog-
              gling  FUNCTION_ARGZERO  from  on to off (or off to on) does not
              change the current value of $0.  Only the state  upon  entry  to
              the function or script has an effect.  Compare POSIX_ARGZERO.

       LOCAL_LOOPS
              When  this  option  is not set, the effect of break and continue
              commands may propagate outside function scope,  affecting  loops
              in calling functions.  When the option is set in a calling func-
              tion, a break or a continue that is not caught within  a  called
              function  (regardless  of  the setting of the option within that
              function) produces a warning and the effect is cancelled.

       LOCAL_OPTIONS <K>
              If this option is set at the point of return from a shell  func-
              tion, most options (including this one) which were in force upon
              entry to  the  function  are  restored;  options  that  are  not
              restored  are  PRIVILEGED  and RESTRICTED.  Otherwise, only this
              option, and the LOCAL_LOOPS, XTRACE and PRINT_EXIT_VALUE options
              are  restored.   Hence  if  this  is explicitly unset by a shell
              function the other options in force at the point of return  will
              remain  so.   A shell function can also guarantee itself a known
              shell configuration with a formulation like  `emulate  -L  zsh';
              the -L activates LOCAL_OPTIONS.

       LOCAL_PATTERNS
              If  this option is set at the point of return from a shell func-
              tion, the state of pattern disables, as  set  with  the  builtin
              command  `disable -p', is restored to what it was when the func-
              tion was entered.  The behaviour of this option  is  similar  to
              the  effect  of  LOCAL_OPTIONS on options; hence `emulate -L sh'
              (or indeed any other emulation with  the  -L  option)  activates
              LOCAL_PATTERNS.

       LOCAL_TRAPS <K>
              If  this  option is set when a signal trap is set inside a func-
              tion, then the previous status of the trap for that signal  will
              be restored when the function exits.  Note that this option must
              be set prior to altering  the  trap  behaviour  in  a  function;
              unlike  LOCAL_OPTIONS,  the  value  on exit from the function is
              irrelevant.  However, it does not need  to  be  set  before  any
              global  trap  for  that  to be correctly restored by a function.
              For example,

                     unsetopt localtraps
                     trap - INT
                     fn() { setopt localtraps; trap '' INT; sleep 3; }

              will restore normal handling of SIGINT after the function exits.

       MULTI_FUNC_DEF <Z>
              Allow definitions of multiple functions at once in the form `fn1
              fn2...()'; if the option is not set, this causes a parse  error.
              Definition  of  multiple  functions with the function keyword is
              always allowed.  Multiple function  definitions  are  not  often
              used and can cause obscure errors.

       MULTIOS <Z>
              Perform  implicit  tees  or  cats when multiple redirections are
              attempted (see the section `Redirection').

       OCTAL_ZEROES <S>
              Interpret any integer constant beginning with a 0 as octal,  per
              IEEE  Std 1003.2-1992 (ISO 9945-2:1993).  This is not enabled by
              default as it causes problems with parsing of, for example, date
              and time strings with leading zeroes.

              Sequences  of  digits indicating a numeric base such as the `08'
              component in `08#77' are always interpreted as decimal,  regard-
              less of leading zeroes.

       PIPE_FAIL
              By  default,  when  a pipeline exits the exit status recorded by
              the shell and returned by the shell variable $? reflects that of
              the rightmost element of a pipeline.  If this option is set, the
              exit status instead reflects the status of the rightmost element
              of  the  pipeline  that  was  non-zero,  or zero if all elements
              exited with zero status.

       SOURCE_TRACE
              If set, zsh will print an informational message  announcing  the
              name of each file it loads.  The format of the output is similar
              to that for the XTRACE option, with the  message  <sourcetrace>.
              A  file  may be loaded by the shell itself when it starts up and
              shuts down  (Startup/Shutdown  Files)  or  by  the  use  of  the
              `source' and `dot' builtin commands.

       TYPESET_SILENT
              If  this is unset, executing any of the `typeset' family of com-
              mands with no options and a list of parameters that have no val-
              ues  to  be assigned but already exist will display the value of
              the parameter.  If the option is set, they will  only  be  shown
              when  parameters  are selected with the `-m' option.  The option
              `-p' is available whether or not the option is set.

       VERBOSE (-v, ksh: -v)
              Print shell input lines as they are read.

       XTRACE (-x, ksh: -x)
              Print commands and their arguments as they  are  executed.   The
              output  is preceded by the value of $PS4, formatted as described
              in the section EXPANSION OF PROMPT SEQUENCES in zshmisc(1).


   Shell Emulation
       BASH_REMATCH
              When set, matches performed with the =~ operator  will  set  the
              BASH_REMATCH  array  variable,  instead of the default MATCH and
              match variables.  The first element of  the  BASH_REMATCH  array
              will  contain  the  entire  matched text and subsequent elements
              will contain extracted substrings.  This option makes more sense
              when  KSH_ARRAYS is also set, so that the entire matched portion
              is stored at index 0 and the first  substring  is  at  index  1.
              Without  this  option,  the  MATCH  variable contains the entire
              matched text and the match array variable contains substrings.

       BSD_ECHO <S>
              Make the echo builtin compatible with the BSD  echo(1)  command.
              This  disables  backslashed  escape  sequences  in  echo strings
              unless the -e option is specified.

       CONTINUE_ON_ERROR
              If a fatal error is encountered (see the section ERRORS in  zsh-
              misc(1)),  and  the  code is running in a script, the shell will
              resume execution at the next statement in the script at the  top
              level,  in other words outside all functions or shell constructs
              such as loops and conditions.   This  mimics  the  behaviour  of
              interactive  shells,  where the shell returns to the line editor
              to read a new command; it was the normal behaviour  in  versions
              of zsh before 5.0.1.

       CSH_JUNKIE_HISTORY <C>
              A history reference without an event specifier will always refer
              to the previous command.  Without this option,  such  a  history
              reference  refers to the same event as the previous history ref-
              erence on the current command line, defaulting to  the  previous
              command.

       CSH_JUNKIE_LOOPS <C>
              Allow  loop  bodies  to take the form `list; end' instead of `do
              list; done'.

       CSH_JUNKIE_QUOTES <C>
              Changes the rules for single- and double-quoted  text  to  match
              that  of  csh.  These require that embedded newlines be preceded
              by a backslash; unescaped newlines will cause an error  message.
              In  double-quoted  strings, it is made impossible to escape `$',
              ``' or `"' (and `\' itself no longer needs  escaping).   Command
              substitutions are only expanded once, and cannot be nested.

       CSH_NULLCMD <C>
              Do  not  use  the values of NULLCMD and READNULLCMD when running
              redirections with no command.  This make such redirections  fail
              (see the section `Redirection').

       KSH_ARRAYS <K> <S>
              Emulate  ksh  array  handling  as  closely as possible.  If this
              option is set, array elements are numbered from zero,  an  array
              parameter  without subscript refers to the first element instead
              of the whole array, and braces are required to  delimit  a  sub-
              script (`${path[2]}' rather than just `$path[2]').

       KSH_AUTOLOAD <K> <S>
              Emulate  ksh function autoloading.  This means that when a func-
              tion is autoloaded, the corresponding file is  merely  executed,
              and  must define the function itself.  (By default, the function
              is defined to the contents of the file.  However, the most  com-
              mon  ksh-style case - of the file containing only a simple defi-
              nition of the function - is always handled in the ksh-compatible
              manner.)

       KSH_OPTION_PRINT <K>
              Alters the way options settings are printed: instead of separate
              lists of set and unset options, all options  are  shown,  marked
              `on' if they are in the non-default state, `off' otherwise.

       KSH_TYPESET <K>
              Alters  the  way  arguments  to  the typeset family of commands,
              including declare, export, float, integer, local  and  readonly,
              are  processed.   Without  this  option, zsh will perform normal
              word splitting after command and parameter  expansion  in  argu-
              ments  of  an  assignment; with it, word splitting does not take
              place in those cases.

       KSH_ZERO_SUBSCRIPT
              Treat use of a subscript  of  value  zero  in  array  or  string
              expressions  as  a reference to the first element, i.e. the ele-
              ment that usually has the subscript 1.  Ignored if KSH_ARRAYS is
              also set.

              If  neither  this  option  nor KSH_ARRAYS is set, accesses to an
              element of an array or string  with  subscript  zero  return  an
              empty  element  or string, while attempts to set element zero of
              an array or string are treated as an error.   However,  attempts
              to  set  an  otherwise  valid subscript range that includes zero
              will succeed.  For example, if KSH_ZERO_SUBSCRIPT is not set,

                     array[0]=(element)

              is an error, while

                     array[0,1]=(element)

              is not and will replace the first element of the array.

              This option is for compatibility  with  older  versions  of  the
              shell and is not recommended in new code.

       POSIX_ALIASES <K> <S>
              When  this  option is set, reserved words are not candidates for
              alias expansion:  it is still possible to declare any of them as
              an  alias, but the alias will never be expanded.  Reserved words
              are described in the section RESERVED WORDS in zshmisc(1).

              Alias expansion takes place while text is being read; hence when
              this  option is set it does not take effect until the end of any
              function or other piece of shell code parsed as one unit.   Note
              this  may  cause  differences  from  other  shells even when the
              option is in effect.  For example, when running a  command  with
              `zsh  -c',  or even `zsh -o posixaliases -c', the entire command
              argument is parsed as one unit, so aliases  defined  within  the
              argument  are  not  available even in later lines.  If in doubt,
              avoid use of aliases in non-interactive code.

       POSIX_ARGZERO
              This option may be used to temporarily disable  FUNCTION_ARGZERO
              and  thereby  restore the value of $0 to the name used to invoke
              the shell (or as set by the -c command line option).   For  com-
              patibility  with  previous versions of the shell, emulations use
              NO_FUNCTION_ARGZERO instead of POSIX_ARGZERO, which  may  result
              in  unexpected  scoping  of  $0 if the emulation mode is changed
              inside a function or script.  To avoid this,  explicitly  enable
              POSIX_ARGZERO in the emulate command:

                     emulate sh -o POSIX_ARGZERO

              Note that NO_POSIX_ARGZERO has no effect unless FUNCTION_ARGZERO
              was already enabled upon entry to the function or script.

       POSIX_BUILTINS <K> <S>
              When this option is set the command builtin can be used to  exe-
              cute  shell  builtin  commands.  Parameter assignments specified
              before shell functions and special builtins are kept  after  the
              command  completes  unless  the special builtin is prefixed with
              the command builtin.  Special builtins are  .,  :,  break,  con-
              tinue,  declare,  eval,  exit, export, integer, local, readonly,
              return, set, shift, source, times, trap and unset.

              In addition, various error conditions associated with the  above
              builtins  or  exec  cause a non-interactive shell to exit and an
              interactive shell to return to its top-level processing.

              Furthermore, the getopts builtin behaves in  a  POSIX-compatible
              fashion in that the associated variable OPTIND is not made local
              to functions.

       POSIX_IDENTIFIERS <K> <S>
              When this option is set, only the ASCII characters a to z, A  to
              Z,  0  to  9  and  _  may be used in identifiers (names of shell
              parameters and modules).

              In addition, setting this option limits the effect of  parameter
              substitution  with  no  braces,  so  that  the  expression $# is
              treated as the parameter $# even if followed by a valid  parame-
              ter  name.   When it is unset, zsh allows expresions of the form
              $#name to refer to the length of $name, even for  special  vari-
              ables, for example in expressions such as $#- and $#*.

              When  the  option  is  unset  and multibyte character support is
              enabled (i.e. it is compiled in  and  the  option  MULTIBYTE  is
              set), then additionally any alphanumeric characters in the local
              character set may be used in identifiers.  Note that scripts and
              functions  written  with this feature are not portable, and also
              that both options must be set before the script or  function  is
              parsed;  setting  them during execution is not sufficient as the
              syntax variable=value has  already  been  parsed  as  a  command
              rather than an assignment.

              If  multibyte  character  support is not compiled into the shell
              this option is ignored; all octets with the top bit set  may  be
              used  in  identifiers.   This  is non-standard but is the tradi-
              tional zsh behaviour.

       POSIX_STRINGS <K> <S>
              This option affects processing of quoted strings.  Currently  it
              only  affects the behaviour of null characters, i.e. character 0
              in the portable character set corresponding to US ASCII.

              When this option is not set,  null  characters  embedded  within
              strings  of  the form $'...' are treated as ordinary characters.
              The entire string is maintained within the shell and  output  to
              files  where  necessary,  although  owing to restrictions of the
              library interface the string is truncated at the null  character
              in  file names, environment variables, or in arguments to exter-
              nal programs.

              When this option is set, the $'...' expression is  truncated  at
              the  null  character.   Note  that  remaining  parts of the same
              string beyond the termination of the quotes are not truncated.

              For example, the command line argument a$'b\0c'd is treated with
              the  option off as the characters a, b, null, c, d, and with the
              option on as the characters a, b, d.

       POSIX_TRAPS <K> <S>
              When this option is set, the usual zsh  behaviour  of  executing
              traps  for  EXIT on exit from shell functions is suppressed.  In
              that case, manipulating EXIT traps always alters the global trap
              for exiting the shell; the LOCAL_TRAPS option is ignored for the
              EXIT trap.  Furthermore, a return statement executed in  a  trap
              with  no  argument  passes back from the function the value from
              the surrounding context, not from code executed within the trap.

       SH_FILE_EXPANSION <K> <S>
              Perform  filename expansion (e.g., ~ expansion) before parameter
              expansion, command substitution, arithmetic expansion and  brace
              expansion.  If this option is unset, it is performed after brace
              expansion, so things like `~$USERNAME' and `~{pfalstad,rc}' will
              work.

       SH_NULLCMD <K> <S>
              Do  not  use  the  values  of NULLCMD and READNULLCMD when doing
              redirections, use `:' instead (see the section `Redirection').

       SH_OPTION_LETTERS <K> <S>
              If this option is set the shell tries to interpret single letter
              options  (which  are  used  with  set and setopt) like ksh does.
              This also affects the value of the - special parameter.

       SH_WORD_SPLIT (-y) <K> <S>
              Causes field splitting to be  performed  on  unquoted  parameter
              expansions.   Note  that this option has nothing to do with word
              splitting.  (See the section `Parameter Expansion'.)

       TRAPS_ASYNC
              While waiting for a program to  exit,  handle  signals  and  run
              traps  immediately.   Otherwise  the  trap  is run after a child
              process has exited.  Note this does  not  affect  the  point  at
              which  traps  are  run for any case other than when the shell is
              waiting for a child process.


   Shell State
       INTERACTIVE (-i, ksh: -i)
              This is an interactive shell.  This option is set upon initiali-
              sation  if  the  standard  input is a tty and commands are being
              read from standard input.  (See the discussion  of  SHIN_STDIN.)
              This  heuristic may be overridden by specifying a state for this
              option on the command line.  The value of this option  can  only
              be  changed  via  flags supplied at invocation of the shell.  It
              cannot be changed once zsh is running.

       LOGIN (-l, ksh: -l)
              This is a login shell.  If this option is  not  explicitly  set,
              the  shell  becomes  a login shell if the first character of the
              argv[0] passed to the shell is a `-'.

       PRIVILEGED (-p, ksh: -p)
              Turn on privileged mode. Typically this is used when  script  is
              to  be run with elevated privileges. This should be done as fol-
              lows directly with the -p option to zsh so that it takes  effect
              during startup.

                     #!/bin/zsh -p

              The  option is enabled automatically on startup if the effective
              user (group) ID is not equal to the real  user  (group)  ID.  In
              this  case, turning the option off causes the effective user and
              group IDs to be set to the real user and  group  IDs.  Be  aware
              that  if  that fails the shell may be running with different IDs
              than was intended so a script should check for failure  and  act
              accordingly, for example:

                     unsetopt privileged || exit

              The  PRIVILEGED option disables sourcing user startup files.  If
              zsh  is  invoked  as  `sh'  or  `ksh'  with  this  option   set,
              /etc/suid_profile  is sourced (after /etc/profile on interactive
              shells). Sourcing ~/.profile is disabled and the contents of the
              ENV variable is ignored. This option cannot be changed using the
              -m option of setopt and unsetopt, and changing it inside a func-
              tion  always changes it globally regardless of the LOCAL_OPTIONS
              option.

       RESTRICTED (-r)
              Enables restricted mode.  This option cannot  be  changed  using
              unsetopt,  and  setting  it  inside a function always changes it
              globally regardless of the LOCAL_OPTIONS option.  See  the  sec-
              tion `Restricted Shell'.

       SHIN_STDIN (-s, ksh: -s)
              Commands  are  being read from the standard input.  Commands are
              read from standard input if no command is specified with -c  and
              no  file of commands is specified.  If SHIN_STDIN is set explic-
              itly on the command line, any argument that would otherwise have
              been  taken as a file to run will instead be treated as a normal
              positional parameter.   Note  that  setting  or  unsetting  this
              option on the command line does not necessarily affect the state
              the option will have while the shell is running - that is purely
              an  indicator of whether or not commands are actually being read
              from standard input.  The value  of  this  option  can  only  be
              changed  via flags supplied at invocation of the shell.  It can-
              not be changed once zsh is running.

       SINGLE_COMMAND (-t, ksh: -t)
              If the shell is reading from standard input, it  exits  after  a
              single  command  has  been  executed.  This also makes the shell
              non-interactive, unless the INTERACTIVE option is explicitly set
              on  the  command  line.   The  value  of this option can only be
              changed via flags supplied at invocation of the shell.  It  can-
              not be changed once zsh is running.


   Zle
       BEEP (+B) <D>
              Beep on error in ZLE.

       COMBINING_CHARS
              Assume  that  the  terminal  displays  combining characters cor-
              rectly.  Specifically, if a base alphanumeric character is  fol-
              lowed  by  one or more zero-width punctuation characters, assume
              that the zero-width characters will be  displayed  as  modifica-
              tions to the base character within the same width.  Not all ter-
              minals handle this.  If this option is not set, zero-width char-
              acters are displayed separately with special mark-up.

              If  this  option  is  set, the pattern test [[:WORD:]] matches a
              zero-width punctuation character on the assumption that it  will
              be  used as part of a word in combination with a word character.
              Otherwise the base shell does not  handle  combining  characters
              specially.

       EMACS  If  ZLE  is  loaded,  turning  on this option has the equivalent
              effect of `bindkey -e'.  In addition, the VI  option  is  unset.
              Turning it off has no effect.  The option setting is not guaran-
              teed to reflect the current keymap.  This option is provided for
              compatibility; bindkey is the recommended interface.

       OVERSTRIKE
              Start up the line editor in overstrike mode.

       SINGLE_LINE_ZLE (-M) <K>
              Use single-line command line editing instead of multi-line.

              Note  that  although  this  is on by default in ksh emulation it
              only provides superficial compatibility with the ksh line editor
              and reduces the effectiveness of the zsh line editor.  As it has
              no effect on shell syntax, many users may wish to  disable  this
              option when using ksh emulation interactively.

       VI     If  ZLE  is  loaded,  turning  on this option has the equivalent
              effect of `bindkey -v'.  In addition, the EMACS option is unset.
              Turning it off has no effect.  The option setting is not guaran-
              teed to reflect the current keymap.  This option is provided for
              compatibility; bindkey is the recommended interface.

       ZLE (-Z)
              Use  the  zsh line editor.  Set by default in interactive shells
              connected to a terminal.


OPTION ALIASES
       Some options have alternative names.  These aliases are never used  for
       output,  but  can be used just like normal option names when specifying
       options to the shell.
