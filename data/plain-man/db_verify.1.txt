db_verify(1)              BSD General Commands Manual             db_verify(1)

NAME
     db_verify

SYNOPSIS
     db_verify [-NoqV] [-h home] [-P password] file ...

DESCRIPTION
     The db_verify utility verifies the structure of one or more files and the
     databases they contain.

     The options are as follows:

     -h
        Specify a home directory for the database environment; by default, the
        current working directory is used.

     -o
        Skip the database checks for btree and duplicate sort order and for
        hashing.

        If the file being verified contains databases with non-default compar-
        ison or hashing configurations, calling the db_verify utility without
        the -o flag will usually return failure. The -o flag causes db_verify
        to ignore database sort or hash ordering and allows db_verify to be
        used on these files. To fully verify these files, verify them explic-
        itly using the DB->verify method, after configuring the correct com-
        parison or hashing functions.

     -N
        Do not acquire shared region mutexes while running. Other problems,
        such as potentially fatal errors in Berkeley DB, will be ignored as
        well. This option is intended only for debugging errors, and should
        not be used under any other circumstances.

     -P
        Specify an environment password. Although Berkeley DB utilities over-
        write password strings as soon as possible, be aware there may be a
        window of vulnerability on systems where unprivileged users can see
        command-line arguments or where utilities are not able to overwrite
        the memory containing the command-line arguments.

     -q
        Suppress the printing of any error descriptions, simply exit success
        or failure.

     -V
        Write the library version number to the standard output, and exit.

     The db_verify utility does not perform any locking, even in Berkeley DB
     environments that are configured with a locking subsystem. As such, it
     should only be used on files that are not being modified by another
     thread of control.

     The db_verify utility may be used with a Berkeley DB environment (as
     described for the -h option, the environment variable DB_HOME, or because
     the utility was run in a directory containing a Berkeley DB environment).
     In order to avoid environment corruption when using a Berkeley DB envi-
     ronment, db_verify should always be given the chance to detach from the
     environment and exit gracefully. To cause db_verify to release all envi-
     ronment resources and exit cleanly, send it an interrupt signal (SIGINT).

     The db_verify utility exits 0 on success, and >0 if an error occurs.

ENVIRONMENT
     DB_HOME  If the -h option is not specified and the environment variable
              DB_HOME is set, it is used as the path of the database home, as
              described in DB_ENV->open.
