NAME
     db_deadlock

SYNOPSIS
     db_deadlock [-Vv] [-a e | m | n | o | w | y] [-h home] [-L file]
                 [-t sec.usec]

DESCRIPTION
     The db_deadlock utility traverses the database environment lock region,
     and aborts a lock request each time it detects a deadlock or a lock
     request that has timed out. By default, in the case of a deadlock, a ran-
     dom lock request is chosen to be aborted.

     This utility should be run as a background daemon, or the underlying
     Berkeley DB deadlock detection interfaces should be called in some other
     way, whenever there are multiple threads or processes accessing a data-
     base and at least one of them is modifying it.

     The options are as follows:

     -a
        When a deadlock is detected, abort the locker:

        m  with the greatest number of locks

        n  with the fewest number of locks

        o  with the oldest locker ID

        w  with the fewest number of write locks

        y  with the youngest locker ID

        When lock or transaction timeouts have been specified:

        e  abort any lock request that has timed out

     -h
        Specify a home directory for the database environment; by default, the
        current working directory is used.

     -L
        Log the execution of the db_deadlock utility to the specified file in
        the following format, where ### is the process ID, and the date is the
        time the utility was started.

              db_deadlock: ### Wed Jun 15 01:23:45 EDT 1995

        This file will be removed if the db_deadlock utility exits gracefully.

     -t
        Check the database environment every sec seconds plus usec microsec-
        onds to see if a process has been forced to wait for a lock; if one
        has, review the database environment lock structures.

     -V
        Write the library version number to the standard output, and exit.

     -v
        Run in verbose mode, generating messages each time the detector runs.

     If the -t option is not specified, db_deadlock will run once and exit.

     The db_deadlock utility uses a Berkeley DB environment (as described for
     the -h option, the environment variable DB_HOME, or because the utility
     was run in a directory containing a Berkeley DB environment). In order to
     avoid environment corruption when using a Berkeley DB environment,
     db_deadlock should always be given the chance to detach from the environ-
     ment and exit gracefully. To cause db_deadlock to release all environment
     resources and exit cleanly, send it an interrupt signal (SIGINT).

     The db_deadlock utility does not attempt to create the Berkeley DB shared
     memory regions if they do not already exist. The application which cre-
     ates the region should be started first, and then, once the region is
     created, the db_deadlock utility should be started.

     The DB_ENV->lock_detect method is the underlying method used by the
     db_deadlock utility. See the db_deadlock utility source code for an exam-
     ple of using DB_ENV->lock_detect in a IEEE/ANSI Std 1003.1 (POSIX) envi-
     ronment.

     The db_deadlock utility exits 0 on success, and >0 if an error occurs.

ENVIRONMENT
     DB_HOME  If the -h option is not specified and the environment variable
              DB_HOME is set, it is used as the path of the database home, as
              described in DB_ENV->open.
