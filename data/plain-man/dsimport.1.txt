NAME

SYNOPSIS
     dsimport filepath nodepath O|M|A|I|N [options]
     dsimport --version
     dsimport --help

DESCRIPTION
     dsimport is a tool for importing records into an Open Directory source.

USAGE
     filepath   is the path of the file to be imported.

     nodepath   is the path of the Open Directory node where the records
                should be imported.

     A flag that specifies how to handle conflicting records:

                O        overwrite of any existing records that have the same
                         record name, UID or GID. All previous attribute val-
                         ues are deleted.

                M        merge import data with existing records or create the
                         record if it does not exist.

                I        ignore the record if there is a conflicting name, UID
                         or GID.

                A        append the data to existing records, but do not cre-
                         ate a record if it does not exist.

                N        no duplicate checking should be done.  Note this
                         could cause failures and/or a slower import process.

     A list of options and their descriptions:

     --crypt  is used to signify that all user passwords are crypt-based.
              Entries in the import file can also be prefixed with {CRYPT} on
              a per record basis if not all users are crypt-based.  By default
              all passwords are assumed to be provided as listed in the import
              file.

     --force attribute value
              forces a specific value for the named attribute for all records
              during the import. The new value will overwrite any value speci-
              fied in the import file. This option may be specified multiple
              times for forcing more than one attribute.

     --groupid value
              is the GID used for any records that do not specify a primary
              GID.

     --grouppreset value
              designate a preset record to be applied to imported group
              records.

     --loglevel value
              changes the amount of logging detail output to the log file.

     --outputfile value
              Outputs a plist to the specified file with a list of changed
              users or groups and rejected records due to name conflicts.
              Also includes a list of deleted records (overwrite mode), and
              lists of records that failed and succeeded during import.  The
              format of this file is likely to change in a future release of
              Mac OS X.

     --password value
              is the admin's password for import operations. Used to authenti-
              cate to the directory node during import. A secure prompt will
              be used for interactive input if not supplied via parameter.
              Using the prompt method is the most secure method of providing
              password to dsimport.

     --recordformat string
              passes in the delimiters and attributes and record type to spec-
              ify the order and names of attributes in the file to be
              imported. An example record format string:

              0x0A 0x5C 0x3A 0x2C dsRecTypeStandard:Users 7 dsAttrTypeS-
              tandard:RecordName dsAttrTypeStandard:Password dsAttrTypeS-
              tandard:UniqueID dsAttrTypeStandard:PrimaryGroupID dsAttrTypeS-
              tandard:RealName dsAttrTypeStandard:NFSHomeDirectory dsAttrType-
              Standard:UserShell

              A special value of IGNORE can be used for values that should be
              ignored in the import file on a record-by-record basis.

     --recordtype type
              Override the record type defined in the import file. For exam-
              ple, to import ComputerGroups as ComputerLists, use:

              --recordtype dsRecTypeStandard:ComputerLists

              The opposite works for importing ComputerLists as Computer-
              Groups, and so on.

     --remotehost hostname | ipaddress
              connects to a remote host at the network address specified.
              Commonly used to import to a remote Mac OS X Server.

     --remoteusername value
              specifies user name to use for the remote connection.

     --remotepassword value
              specifies password to use for the remote connection. A secure
              prompt will be used to ask for the password if --remoteusername
              is specified and --remotepassword is not.  Using the prompt
              method is the most secure method of providing password to
              dsimport.

     --startid value
              indicates the ID number to start with when the import tool gen-
              erates user or group IDs for any import file that lacks an ID as
              part of the import data.

     --template StandardUser | StandardGroup
              is used for delimited import of files that lack field descrip-
              tions.

              StandardUser contains the following fields in the order:
                    1.   RecordName
                    2.   Password
                    3.   UniqueID
                    4.   PrimaryGroupID
                    5.   DistinguishedName
                    6.   NFSHomeDirectory
                    7.   UserShell

              StandardGroup contains the following fields in the order:
                    1.   RecordName
                    2.   Password
                    3.   PrimaryGroupID
                    4.   GroupMembership

     --username value
              is the admin username to use when importing records. If this is
              not specified the current user is the default name.  Also, if
              used in conjunction with --remotehost then this admin user will
              be used for the Open Directory node whereas the username pro-
              vided in --remoteusername will be used for the remote connec-
              tion.  If this option is left off but --remoteusername is pro-
              vided, then the remote username will be used for both the con-
              nection and for importing records.

     --userpreset value
              designate a preset record to be applied to imported user
              records.
