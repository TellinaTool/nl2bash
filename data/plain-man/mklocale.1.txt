MKLOCALE(1)               BSD General Commands Manual              MKLOCALE(1)

NAME
     mklocale -- make LC_CTYPE locale files

SYNOPSIS
     mklocale [-d] < src-file > language/LC_CTYPE
     mklocale [-d] -o language/LC_CTYPE src-file

DESCRIPTION
     The mklocale utility reads a LC_CTYPE source file from standard input and
     produces a LC_CTYPE binary file on standard output suitable for placement
     in /usr/share/locale/language/LC_CTYPE.

     The format of src-file is quite simple.  It consists of a series of lines
     which start with a keyword and have associated data following.  C style
     comments are used to place comments in the file.

     Following options are available:

     -d      Turns on debugging messages.

     -o      Specify output file.

     Besides the keywords which will be listed below, the following are valid
     tokens in src-file:

     RUNE     A RUNE may be any of the following:

              'x'          The ASCII character x.

              '\x'         The ANSI C character \x where \x is one of \a, \b,
                           \f, \n, \r, \t, or \v.

              0x[0-9a-z]*  A hexadecimal number representing a rune code.

              0[0-7]*      An octal number representing a rune code.

              [1-9][0-9]*  A decimal number representing a rune code.

     STRING   A string enclosed in double quotes (").

     THRU     Either ... or -.  Used to indicate ranges.

     literal  The follow characters are taken literally:

              <([  Used to start a mapping.  All are equivalent.

              >)]  Used to end a mapping.  All are equivalent.

              :    Used as a delimiter in mappings.

     Key words which should only appear once are:

     ENCODING   Followed by a STRING which indicates the encoding mechanism to
                be used for this locale.  The current encodings are:

                ASCII    American Standard Code for Information Interchange.

                BIG5     The ``Big5'' encoding of Chinese.

                EUC      EUC encoding as used by several vendors of UNIX sys-
                         tems.

                GB18030  PRC national standard for encoding of Chinese text.

                GB2312   Older PRC national standard for encoding Chinese
                         text.

                GBK      A widely used encoding method for Chinese text, back-
                         wards compatible with GB 2312-1980.

                MSKanji  The method of encoding Japanese used by Microsoft,
                         loosely based on JIS.  Also known as ``Shift JIS''
                         and ``SJIS''.

                NONE     No translation and the default.

                UTF-8    The UTF-8 transformation format of ISO 10646 as
                         defined by RFC 2279.

     VARIABLE   This keyword must be followed by a single tab or space charac-
                ter, after which encoding specific data is placed.  Currently
                only the EUC encoding requires variable data.  See euc(5) for
                further details.

     INVALID    (obsolete) A single RUNE follows and is used as the invalid
                rune for this locale.

     The following keywords may appear multiple times and have the following
     format for data:

           <RUNE1 RUNE2>              RUNE1 is mapped to RUNE2.

           <RUNE1 THRU RUNEn: RUNE2>  Runes RUNE1 through RUNEn are mapped to
                                      RUNE2 through RUNE2 + n-1.

     MAPLOWER   Defines the tolower mappings.  RUNE2 is the lower case repre-
                sentation of RUNE1.

     MAPUPPER   Defines the toupper mappings.  RUNE2 is the upper case repre-
                sentation of RUNE1.

     TODIGIT    Defines a map from runes to their digit value.  RUNE2 is the
                integer value represented by RUNE1.  For example, the ASCII
                character `0' would map to the decimal value 0.  Only values
                up to 255 are allowed.

     The following keywords may appear multiple times and have the following
     format for data:

           RUNE              This rune has the property defined by the key-
                             word.

           RUNE1 THRU RUNEn  All the runes between and including RUNE1 and
                             RUNEn have the property defined by the keyword.

     ALPHA      Defines runes which are alphabetic, printable and graphic.

     CONTROL    Defines runes which are control characters.

     DIGIT      Defines runes which are decimal digits, printable and graphic.

     GRAPH      Defines runes which are graphic and printable.

     LOWER      Defines runes which are lower case, printable and graphic.

     PUNCT      Defines runes which are punctuation, printable and graphic.

     SPACE      Defines runes which are spaces.

     UPPER      Defines runes which are upper case, printable and graphic.

     XDIGIT     Defines runes which are hexadecimal digits, printable and
                graphic.

     BLANK      Defines runes which are blank.

     PRINT      Defines runes which are printable.

     IDEOGRAM   Defines runes which are ideograms, printable and graphic.

     SPECIAL    Defines runes which are special characters, printable and
                graphic.

     PHONOGRAM  Defines runes which are phonograms, printable and graphic.

     SWIDTH0    Defines runes with display width 0.

     SWIDTH1    Defines runes with display width 1.

     SWIDTH2    Defines runes with display width 2.

     SWIDTH3    Defines runes with display width 3.

     If no display width explicitly defined, width 1 assumed for printable
     runes by default.
