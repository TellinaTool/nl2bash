HOSTNAME(1)               BSD General Commands Manual              HOSTNAME(1)

NAME
     hostname -- set or print name of current host system

SYNOPSIS
     hostname [-fs] [name-of-host]

DESCRIPTION
     The hostname utility prints the name of the current host.  The super-user
     can set the hostname by supplying an argument.  To keep the hostname
     between reboots, run `scutil --set HostName name-of-host'.

     Options:

     -f    Include domain information in the printed name.  This is the
           default behavior.

     -s    Trim off any domain information from the printed name.
