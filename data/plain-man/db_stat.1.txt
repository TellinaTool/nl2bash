db_stat(1)                BSD General Commands Manual               db_stat(1)

NAME
     db_stat

SYNOPSIS
     db_stat -d file [-fN] [-h home] [-P password] [-s database]
     db_stat [-celmNrtVZ] [-C Aclmop] [-h home] [-M Ahm] [-P password]

DESCRIPTION
     The db_stat utility utility displays statistics for Berkeley DB environ-
     ments.

     The options are as follows:

     -C
        Display internal information about the lock region. (The output from
        this option is often both voluminous and meaningless, and is intended
        only for debugging.)

        A  Display all information.

        c  Display lock conflict matrix.

        l  Display lockers within hash chains.

        m  Display region memory information.

        o  Display objects within hash chains.

        p  Display lock region parameters.

     -c
        Display lock region statistics, as described in DB_ENV->lock_stat.

     -d
        Display database statistics for the specified file, as described in
        DB->stat.

        If the database contains multiple databases and the -s flag is not
        specified, the statistics are for the internal database that describes
        the other databases the file contains, and not for the file as a
        whole.

     -e
        Display current environment statistics.

     -f
        Display only those database statistics that can be acquired without
        traversing the database.

     -h
        Specify a home directory for the database environment; by default, the
        current working directory is used.

     -l
        Display log region statistics, as described in DB_ENV->log_stat.

     -M
        Display internal information about the shared memory buffer pool. (The
        output from this option is often both voluminous and meaningless, and
        is intended only for debugging.)

        A  Display all information.

        h  Display buffers within hash chains.

        m  Display region memory information.

     -m
        Display shared memory buffer pool statistics, as described in
        DB_ENV->memp_stat.

     -N
        Do not acquire shared region mutexes while running. Other problems,
        such as potentially fatal errors in Berkeley DB, will be ignored as
        well. This option is intended only for debugging errors, and should
        not be used under any other circumstances.

     -P
        Specify an environment password. Although Berkeley DB utilities over-
        write password strings as soon as possible, be aware there may be a
        window of vulnerability on systems where unprivileged users can see
        command-line arguments or where utilities are not able to overwrite
        the memory containing the command-line arguments.

     -r
        Display replication statistics, as described in DB_ENV->rep_stat.

     -s
        Display statistics for the specified database contained in the file
        specified with the -d flag.

     -t
        Display transaction region statistics, as described in
        DB_ENV->txn_stat.

     -V
        Write the library version number to the standard output, and exit.

     -Z
        Reset the statistics after reporting them; valid only with the -c, -e,
        -l, -m, and -t options.

     Values normally displayed in quantities of bytes are displayed as a com-
     bination of gigabytes (GB), megabytes (MB), kilobytes (KB), and bytes
     (B). Otherwise, values smaller than 10 million are displayed without any
     special notation, and values larger than 10 million are displayed as a
     number followed by "M".

     The db_stat utility may be used with a Berkeley DB environment (as
     described for the -h option, the environment variable DB_HOME, or because
     the utility was run in a directory containing a Berkeley DB environment).
     In order to avoid environment corruption when using a Berkeley DB envi-
     ronment, db_stat should always be given the chance to detach from the
     environment and exit gracefully. To cause db_stat to release all environ-
     ment resources and exit cleanly, send it an interrupt signal (SIGINT).

     The db_stat utility exits 0 on success, and >0 if an error occurs.

ENVIRONMENT
     DB_HOME  If the -h option is not specified and the environment variable
              DB_HOME is set, it is used as the path of the database home, as
              described in DB_ENV->open.
