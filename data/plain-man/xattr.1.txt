XATTR(1)                  BSD General Commands Manual                 XATTR(1)

NAME
     xattr -- display and manipulate extended attributes

SYNOPSIS
     xattr [-lrsvx] file ...
     xattr -p [-lrsvx] attr_name file ...
     xattr -w [-rsx] attr_name attr_value file ...
     xattr -d [-rsv] attr_name file ...
     xattr -c [-rsv] file ...
     xattr -h | --help

DESCRIPTION
     The xattr command can be used to display, modify or remove the extended
     attributes of one or more files, including directories and symbolic
     links.  Extended attributes are arbitrary metadata stored with a file,
     but separate from the filesystem attributes (such as modification time or
     file size).  The metadata is often a null-terminated UTF-8 string, but
     can also be arbitrary binary data.

     One or more files may be specified on the command line.  For the first
     two forms of the command, when there are more than one file, the file
     name is displayed along with the actual results.  When only one file is
     specified, the display of the file name is usually suppressed (unless the
     -v option described below, is also specified).

     In the first form of the command (without any other mode option speci-
     fied), the names of all extended attributes are listed.  Attribute names
     can also be displayed using ``ls -l@''.

     In the second form, using the -p option (``print''), the value associated
     with the given attribute name is displayed.  Attribute values are usually
     displayed as strings.  However, if nils are detected in the data, the
     value is displayed in a hexadecimal representation.

     The third form, with the -w option (``write''), causes the given
     attribute name to be assigned the given value.

     The fourth form, with the -d option (``delete''), causes the given
     attribute name (and associated value), to be removed.

     In the fifth form, with the -c option (``clear''), causes all attributes
     (including their associated values), to be removed.

     Finally, the last form, with either the -h or --help option, displays a
     short help message and exits immediately.

OPTIONS
     -l  By default, the first two command forms either displays just the
         attribute names or values, respectively.  The -l option causes both
         the attribute names and corresponding values to be displayed.  For
         hexadecimal display of values, the output is preceeded with the hexa-
         decimal offset values and followed by ASCII display, enclosed by
         ``|''.

     -r  If a file argument is a directory, act as if the entire contents of
         the directory recursively were also specified (so that every file in
         the directory tree is acted upon).

     -s  If a file argument is a symbolic link, act on the symbolic link
         itself, rather than the file that the symbolic link points at.

     -v  Force the the file name to be displayed, even for a single file.

     -x  Force the attribute value to be displayed in the hexadecimal repre-
         sentation.

         The -w option normally assumes the input attribute value is a string.
         Specifying the -x option causes xattr to expect the input in hexadec-
         imal (whitespace is ignored).  The xxd(1) command can be used to cre-
         ate hexadecimal representations from exising binary data, to pass to
         xattr.

EXIT STATUS
     The xattr command exits with zero status on success.  On error, non-zero
     is returned, and an error message is printed to the standard error.  For
     system call errors, both the error code and error string are printed (see
     getxattr(2), listxattr(2), removexattr(2) and setxattr(2) for a complete
     list of possible error codes).

     Some attribute data may have a fixed length that is enforced by the sys-
     tem.  For example,

           % xattr -w com.apple.FinderInfo 0 foo
           xattr: [Errno 34] Result too large: 'foo'

     The com.apple.FinderInfo attribute must be 32 bytes in length.

EXAMPLES
     This example copies the com.apple.FinderInfo attribute from the /usr
     directory to the MyDir directory:

           % xattr -px com.apple.FinderInfo /usr
           00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 40 00 00 00 00 00 00 00
           00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00
           % xattr -l MyDir
           % xattr -wx com.apple.FinderInfo \
             "`xattr -px com.apple.FinderInfo /usr`" MyDir
           % xattr -l MyDir
           com.apple.FinderInfo:
           00000000  00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 40 00 00 00 00 00 00 00  |........@.......|
           00000010  00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00  |................|
           00000020
