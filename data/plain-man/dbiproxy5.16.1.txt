NAME
       dbiproxy - A proxy server for the DBD::Proxy driver

SYNOPSIS
           dbiproxy <options> --localport=<port>

DESCRIPTION
       This tool is just a front end for the DBI::ProxyServer package. All it
       does is picking options from the command line and calling
       DBI::ProxyServer::main(). See DBI::ProxyServer for details.

       Available options include:

       --chroot=dir
           (UNIX only)  After doing a bind(), change root directory to the
           given directory by doing a chroot(). This is useful for security,
           but it restricts the environment a lot. For example, you need to
           load DBI drivers in the config file or you have to create hard
           links to Unix sockets, if your drivers are using them. For example,
           with MySQL, a config file might contain the following lines:

               my $rootdir = '/var/dbiproxy';
               my $unixsockdir = '/tmp';
               my $unixsockfile = 'mysql.sock';
               foreach $dir ($rootdir, "$rootdir$unixsockdir") {
                   mkdir 0755, $dir;
               }
               link("$unixsockdir/$unixsockfile",
                    "$rootdir$unixsockdir/$unixsockfile");
               require DBD::mysql;

               {
                   'chroot' => $rootdir,
                   ...
               }

           If you don't know chroot(), think of an FTP server where you can
           see a certain directory tree only after logging in. See also the
           --group and --user options.

       --configfile=file
           Config files are assumed to return a single hash ref that overrides
           the arguments of the new method. However, command line arguments in
           turn take precedence over the config file. See the "CONFIGURATION
           FILE" section in the DBI::ProxyServer documentation for details on
           the config file.

       --debug
           Turn debugging mode on. Mainly this asserts that logging messages
           of level "debug" are created.

       --facility=mode
           (UNIX only) Facility to use for Sys::Syslog. The default is daemon.

       --group=gid
           After doing a bind(), change the real and effective GID to the
           given.  This is useful, if you want your server to bind to a
           privileged port (<1024), but don't want the server to execute as
           root. See also the --user option.

           GID's can be passed as group names or numeric values.

       --localaddr=ip
           By default a daemon is listening to any IP number that a machine
           has. This attribute allows to restrict the server to the given IP
           number.

       --localport=port
           This attribute sets the port on which the daemon is listening. It
           must be given somehow, as there's no default.

       --logfile=file
           Be default logging messages will be written to the syslog (Unix) or
           to the event log (Windows NT). On other operating systems you need
           to specify a log file. The special value "STDERR" forces logging to
           stderr. See Net::Daemon::Log for details.

       --mode=modename
           The server can run in three different modes, depending on the
           environment.

           If you are running Perl 5.005 and did compile it for threads, then
           the server will create a new thread for each connection. The thread
           will execute the server's Run() method and then terminate. This
           mode is the default, you can force it with "--mode=threads".

           If threads are not available, but you have a working fork(), then
           the server will behave similar by creating a new process for each
           connection.  This mode will be used automatically in the absence of
           threads or if you use the "--mode=fork" option.

           Finally there's a single-connection mode: If the server has
           accepted a connection, he will enter the Run() method. No other
           connections are accepted until the Run() method returns (if the
           client disconnects).  This operation mode is useful if you have
           neither threads nor fork(), for example on the Macintosh. For
           debugging purposes you can force this mode with "--mode=single".

       --pidfile=file
           (UNIX only) If this option is present, a PID file will be created
           at the given location. Default is to not create a pidfile.

       --user=uid
           After doing a bind(), change the real and effective UID to the
           given.  This is useful, if you want your server to bind to a
           privileged port (<1024), but don't want the server to execute as
           root. See also the --group and the --chroot options.

           UID's can be passed as group names or numeric values.

       --version
           Supresses startup of the server; instead the version string will be
           printed and the program exits immediately.
