NAME
       rmiregistry - Java remote object registry

SYNOPSIS
       rmiregistry [ port ]

DESCRIPTION
       The  rmiregistry command creates and starts a remote object registry on
       the specified port on the current host.  If port number is omitted, the
       registry  is started on port 1099.  The rmiregistry command produces no
       output and is typically run in the background.  For example:

              example% rmiregistry &

       A remote object registry is a bootstrap naming service that is used  by
       RMI  servers  on  a  host to bind remote objects to names.  Clients can
       then look up remote objects and make remote method invocations.

       The registry is typically used to locate the  first  remote  object  on
       which an application needs to invoke methods.  That object in turn pro-
       vides application-specific support for finding other objects.

       The methods of the java.rmi.registry.LocateRegistry class are  used  to
       get a registry operating on a particular host or host and port.

       The  URL-based  methods  of the java.rmi.Naming class operate on a reg-
       istry and can be used to  look  up  a  remote  object,  bind  a  simple
       (string)  name to a remote object, rebind a new name to a remote object
       (overriding the old binding), unbind a remote object, and list the URLs
       bound in the registry.

OPTIONS
       The following option is supported:

       -Joption       Used  in  conjunction  with any java option, this option
                      passes option (no spaces between -J and  option)  on  to
                      the java interpreter.
