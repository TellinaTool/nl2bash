creatbyproc.d(1m)                USER COMMANDS               creatbyproc.d(1m)



NAME
       creatbyproc.d - snoop creat()s by process name. Uses DTrace.

SYNOPSIS
       creatbyproc.d

DESCRIPTION
       creatbyproc.d  is  a  DTrace  OneLiner  to  print  file creations as it
       occurs, including the name of the process calling the open.

       This matches file creates from the creat() system call;  not  all  file
       creation  occurs  in  this  way,  sometimes it is through open() with a
       O_CREAT flag, this script will not monitor that activity.

       Docs/oneliners.txt  and  Docs/Examples/oneliners_examples.txt  in   the
       DTraceToolkit  contain  this  as  a oneliner that can be cut-n-paste to
       run.

       Since this uses DTrace, only users with root privileges  can  run  this
       command.

EXAMPLES
       This prints process names and new pathnames until Ctrl-C is hit.
              # creatbyproc.d
