NAME
       rwsnoop - snoop read/write events. Uses DTrace.

SYNOPSIS
       rwsnoop [-jPtvZ] [-n name] [-p PID]

DESCRIPTION
       This  is  measuring  reads  and  writes  at the application level. This
       matches the syscalls read, write, pread and pwrite.

       Since this uses DTrace, only users with root privileges  can  run  this
       command.

OPTIONS
       -j     print project ID

       -P     print parent process ID

       -t     print timestamp, us

       -v     print time, string

       -Z     print zone ID

       -n name
              process name to track

       -p PID PID to track


EXAMPLES
       Default output,
              # rwsnoop
