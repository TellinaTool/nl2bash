db_recover(1)             BSD General Commands Manual            db_recover(1)

NAME
     db_recover

SYNOPSIS
     db_recover [-ceVv] [-h home] [-P password] [-t [[CC]YY]MMDDhhmm[.SS]]

DESCRIPTION
     The db_recover utility must be run after an unexpected application,
     Berkeley DB, or system failure to restore the database to a consistent
     state. All committed transactions are guaranteed to appear after
     db_recover has run, and all uncommitted transactions will be completely
     undone.

     The options are as follows:

     -c
        Perform catastrophic recovery instead of normal recovery.

     -e
        Retain the environment after running recovery. This option will rarely
        be used unless a DB_CONFIG file is present in the home directory. If a
        DB_CONFIG file is not present, then the regions will be created with
        default parameter values.

     -h
        Specify a home directory for the database environment; by default, the
        current working directory is used.

     -P
        Specify an environment password. Although Berkeley DB utilities over-
        write password strings as soon as possible, be aware there may be a
        window of vulnerability on systems where unprivileged users can see
        command-line arguments or where utilities are not able to overwrite
        the memory containing the command-line arguments.

     -t
        Recover to the time specified rather than to the most current possible
        date. The timestamp argument should be in the form [[CC]YY]MMD-
        Dhhmm[.SS] where each pair of letters represents the following:

        CC
           The first two digits of the year (the century).

        YY
           The second two digits of the year. If "YY" is specified, but "CC"
           is not, a value for "YY" between 69 and 99 results in a "YY" value
           of 19. Otherwise, a "YY" value of 20 is used.

        MM
           The month of the year, from 1 to 12.

        DD
           The day of the month, from 1 to 31.

        hh
           The hour of the day, from 0 to 23.

        mm
           The minute of the hour, from 0 to 59.

        SS
           The second of the minute, from 0 to 61.
        If the "CC" and "YY" letter pairs are not specified, the values
        default to the current year. If the "SS" letter pair is not specified,
        the value defaults to 0.

     -V
        Write the library version number to the standard output, and exit.

     -v
        Run in verbose mode.

     In the case of catastrophic recovery, an archival copy -- or snapshot --
     of all database files must be restored along with all of the log files
     written since the database file snapshot was made. (If disk space is a
     problem, log files may be referenced by symbolic links). For further
     information on creating a database snapshot, see Archival Procedures. For
     further information on performing recovery, see Recovery Procedures.

     If the failure was not catastrophic, the files present on the system at
     the time of failure are sufficient to perform recovery.

     If log files are missing, db_recover will identify the missing log
     file(s) and fail, in which case the missing log files need to be restored
     and recovery performed again.

     The db_recover utility uses a Berkeley DB environment (as described for
     the -h option, the environment variable DB_HOME, or because the utility
     was run in a directory containing a Berkeley DB environment). In order to
     avoid environment corruption when using a Berkeley DB environment,
     db_recover should always be given the chance to detach from the environ-
     ment and exit gracefully. To cause db_recover to release all environment
     resources and exit cleanly, send it an interrupt signal (SIGINT).

     The db_recover utility exits 0 on success, and >0 if an error occurs.

ENVIRONMENT
     DB_HOME  If the -h option is not specified and the environment variable
              DB_HOME is set, it is used as the path of the database home, as
              described in DB_ENV->open.
