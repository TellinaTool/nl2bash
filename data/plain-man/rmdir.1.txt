NAME
     rmdir -- remove directories

SYNOPSIS
     rmdir [-p] directory ...

DESCRIPTION
     The rmdir utility removes the directory entry specified by each directory
     argument, provided it is empty.

     Arguments are processed in the order given.  In order to remove both a
     parent directory and a subdirectory of that parent, the subdirectory must
     be specified first so the parent directory is empty when rmdir tries to
     remove it.

     The following option is available:

     -p      Each directory argument is treated as a pathname of which all
             components will be removed, if they are empty, starting with the
             last most component.  (See rm(1) for fully non-discriminant
             recursive removal.)

     The rmdir utility exits with one of the following values:

     0       Each directory entry specified by a dir operand referred to an
             empty directory and was removed successfully.

     >0      An error occurred.

STANDARDS

     ible.
