DESCRIPTION
     dsconfigldap allows addition or removal of LDAP server configurations.
     Presented below is a discussion of possible parameters. Usage has three
     intents: add server config, remove server config, or display help.

     Options list and their descriptions:

     -f       Bindings will be established or dropped in conjunction with the
              addition or removal of the LDAP server configuration.

     -v       This enables the logging to stdout of the details of the opera-
              tions. This can be redirected to a file.

     -i       You will be prompted for a password to use in conjunction with a
              specified username.

     -s       This ensures that no clear text passwords will be sent to the
              LDAP server during authentication.  This will only be enabled if
              the server supports non-cleartext methods.

     -e       This ensures that if the server is capable of supporting encryp-
              tion methods (i.e., SSL or Kerberos) that encryption will be
              enforced at all times via policy.

     -m       This ensures that man-in-the-middle capabilities will be
              enforced via Kerberos, if the server supports the capability.

     -g       This ensures that packet signing capabilities will be enforced
              via Kerberos, if the server supports the capability.

     -x       Connection to the LDAP server will only be made over SSL.

     -S       Will skip updating the search policies.

     -N       Will assume Yes for installing certificates

     -h       Display usage statement.

     -a servername
              This is either the fully qualified domain name or correct IP
              address of the LDAP server to be added to the DirectoryService
              LDAPv3 configuration.

     -r servername
              This is either the fully qualified domain name or correct IP
              address of the LDAP server to be removed from the DirectorySer-
              vice LDAPv3 configuration.

     -n configname
              This is the UI configuration label that is to be given the LDAP
              server configuration.

     -c computerid
              This is the name to be used for directory binding to the LDAP
              server. If none is given the first substring, before a period,
              of the hostname (the defined environment variable "HOST") is
              used.

     -u username
              Username of a privileged network user to be used in authenti-
              cated directory binding.

     -p password
              Password for the privileged network user.  This is a less secure
              method of providing a password, as it may be viewed via process
              list.  For stronger security leave the option off and you will
              be prompted for a password.

     -l username
              Username of a local administrator.

     -q password
              Password for the local administrator.  This is a less secure
              method of providing a password, as it may be viewed via process
              list.  For stronger security leave the option off and you will
              be prompted for a password.

EXAMPLES
     dsconfigldap -a ldap.company.com

     The LDAP server config for the LDAP server myldap.company.com will be
     added. If authenticated directory binding is required by the LDAP server,
     then this call will fail. Otherwise, the following parameters configname,
     computerid, and local admin name will respectively pick up these
     defaults: ip address of the LDAP servername, substring up to first period
     of fully qualified hostname, and username of the user in the shell this
     tool was invoked.

     dsconfigldap -r ldap.company.com

     The LDAP server config for the LDAP server myldap.company.com will be
     removed but not unbound since no network user credentials were supplied.
     The local admin name will be the username of the user in the shell this
     tool was invoked.
