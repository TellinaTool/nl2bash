LAST(1)                   BSD General Commands Manual                  LAST(1)

NAME
     last -- indicate last logins of users and ttys

SYNOPSIS
     last [-n] [-h host] [-t tty] [user ...]

DESCRIPTION
     Last will list the sessions of specified users, ttys, and hosts, in
     reverse time order.  Each line of output contains the user name, the tty
     from which the session was conducted, any hostname, the start and stop
     times for the session, and the duration of the session.  If the session
     is still continuing or was cut short by a crash or shutdown, last will so
     indicate.

     -n          Limits the report to n lines.

     -h host     Host names may be names or internet numbers.

     -t tty      Specify the tty.  Tty names may be given fully or abbrevi-
                 ated, for example, ``last -t 03'' is equivalent to ``last -t
                 tty03''.

     If multiple arguments are given, the information which applies to any of
     the arguments is printed, e.g., ``last root -t console'' would list all
     of ``root's'' sessions as well as all sessions on the console terminal.
     If no users, hostnames or terminals are specified, last prints a record
     of all logins and logouts.

     The pseudo-user reboot logs in at reboots of the system, thus ``last
     reboot'' will give an indication of mean time between reboot.

     If last is interrupted, it indicates to what date the search has pro-
     gressed.  If interrupted with a quit signal last indicates how far the
     search has progressed and then continues.
