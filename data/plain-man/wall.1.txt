WALL(1)                   BSD General Commands Manual                  WALL(1)

NAME
     wall -- write a message to users

SYNOPSIS
     wall [-g group] [file]

DESCRIPTION
     The wall utility displays the contents of file or, by default, its stan-
     dard input, on the terminals of all currently logged in users.

     Only the super-user can write on the terminals of users who have chosen
     to deny messages or are using a program which automatically denies mes-
     sages.

     -g      Send messages to users in this group.  This option may be speci-
             fied multiple times, and any user in any of the specified groups
             will receive the message.

SEE ALSO
     mesg(1), talk(1), write(1), shutdown(8)

HISTORY
     A wall command appeared in PWB UNIX.

BUGS
     The sender's LC_CTYPE setting is used to determine which characters are
     safe to write to a terminal, not the receiver's (which wall has no way of
     knowing).

     The wall utility does not recognize multibyte characters.
