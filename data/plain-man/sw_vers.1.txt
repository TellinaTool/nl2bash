NAME
     sw_vers -- print Mac OS X operating system version information

SYNOPSIS
     sw_vers
     sw_vers -productName
     sw_vers -productVersion
     sw_vers -buildVersion

DESCRIPTION
     sw_vers prints version information about the Mac OS X or Mac OS X Server
     operating system running on the local machine.

     When executed with no options sw_vers prints a short list of version
     properties:

           % sw_vers
           ProductName:    Mac OS X
           ProductVersion: 10.3
           BuildVersion:   7A100

     The ProductName property provides the name of the operating system
     release (typically either "Mac OS X" or "Mac OS X Server").  The
     ProductVersion property defines the version of the operating system
     release (for example, "10.2.4" or "10.3").  The BuildVersion property
     provides the specific revision of the operating system as generated by
     the Mac OS X build system.

OPTIONS
     The output of sw_vers can be refined by the following options.

     -productName     Print just the value of the ProductName property.

     -productVersion  Print just the value of the ProductVersion property.

     -buildVersion    Print just the value of the BuildVersion property.
