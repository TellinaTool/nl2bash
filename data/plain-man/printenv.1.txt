     printenv [name]

DESCRIPTION

     the environment, with one name/value pair per line.  If name is speci-
     fied, only its value is printed.

     Some shells may provide a builtin printenv command which is similar or
     identical to this utility.  Consult the builtin(1) manual page.

EXIT STATUS
     The printenv utility exits 0 on success, and >0 if an error occurs.

     The printenv utility is provided for compatibility with earlier BSD and
     FreeBSD releases and is not specified by any standards.  The functional-
     ity of printenv can be duplicated with the echo(1) and env(1) utilities.

HISTORY
     The printenv command appeared in 3.0BSD.
