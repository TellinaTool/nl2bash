GNOME-XML(1)                         1.1.0                        GNOME-XML(1)



NAME
       xml2-config  - script to get information about the installed version of
       GNOME-XML

SYNOPSIS
       xml2-config [--prefix[=DIR]] [--libs] [--cflags] [--version] [--help]

DESCRIPTION
       xml2-config is a tool that is used to determine the compile and  linker
       flags  that should be used to compile and link programs that use GNOME-
       XML.

OPTIONS
       xml2-config accepts the following options:

       --version
               Print the currently installed version of GNOME-XML on the stan-
               dard output.

       --libs  Print  the  linker flags that are necessary to link a GNOME-XML
               program.

       --cflags
               Print the compiler flags that are necessary to compile a GNOME-
               XML program.

       --prefix=PREFIX
               If  specified,  use  PREFIX  instead of the installation prefix
               that GNOME-XML was built with when computing the output for the
               --cflags  and  --libs  options.  This  option must be specified
               before any --libs or --cflags options.
