NAME
       tfmtodit - create font files for use with groff -Tdvi

SYNOPSIS
       tfmtodit [ -sv ] [ -ggf_file ] [ -kskewchar ] tfm_file map_file font

       It is possible to have whitespace between a command line option and its
       parameter.

DESCRIPTION
       tfmtodit creates a font file for use with groff -Tdvi.  tfm_file is the
       name of the TeX font metric file for the font.  map_file is a file giv-
       ing the groff names for characters in the font; this file  should  con-
       sist of a sequence of lines of the form:

              n c1 c2 ...

       where  n  is  a decimal integer giving the position of the character in
       the font, and c1, c2,...  are the groff names of the character.   If  a
       character  has  no groff names but exists in the tfm file, then it will
       be put in the groff font file as an unnamed  character.   font  is  the
       name of the groff font file.  The groff font file is written to font.

       The -s option should be given if the font is special (a font is special
       if troff should search it whenever a character is not found in the cur-
       rent  font.)   If the font is special, it should be listed in the fonts
       command in the DESC file; if it is not special, there  is  no  need  to
       list it, since troff can automatically mount it when it's first used.

       To do a good job of math typesetting, groff requires font metric infor-
       mation not present in the tfm file.  The reason for this  is  that  TeX
       has  separate  math italic fonts whereas groff uses normal italic fonts
       for math.  The additional information required by groff is given by the
       two  arguments  to  the math_fit macro in the Metafont programs for the
       Computer Modern fonts.  In a text font (a font for  which  math_fitting
       is false), Metafont normally ignores these two arguments.  Metafont can
       be made to put this information in the gf file by loading the following
       definition after cmbase when creating cm.base:

              def ignore_math_fit(expr left_adjustment,right_adjustment) =
                  special "adjustment";
                  numspecial left_adjustment*16/designsize;
                  numspecial right_adjustment*16/designsize;
                  enddef;

       For  the EC font family, load the following definition after exbase (it
       is probably easiest to patch exbase.mf locally):

              def ignore_math_fit(expr left_adjustment,right_adjustment) =
                  ori_special "adjustment";
                  ori_numspecial left_adjustment*16/designsize;
                  ori_numspecial right_adjustment*16/designsize;
                  enddef;

       The gf file created using this modified cm.base  or  exbase  should  be
       specified  with the -g option.  The -g option should not be given for a
       font for which math_fitting is true.

OPTIONS
       -v     Print the version number.

       -s     The font is special.  The effect of this option is  to  add  the
              special command to the font file.

       -kn    The  skewchar  of  this  font  is at position n.  n should be an
              integer; it may be given in decimal, or  with  a  leading  0  in
              octal,  or with a leading 0x in hexadecimal.  The effect of this
              option is to ignore any kerns  whose  second  component  is  the
              specified character.

       -ggf_file
              gf_file is a gf file produced by Metafont containing special and
              numspecial commands giving additional font metric information.
