RWHO(1)                   BSD General Commands Manual                  RWHO(1)

NAME
     rwho -- who is logged in on local machines

SYNOPSIS
     rwho [-a]

DESCRIPTION
     The rwho command produces output similar to who(1), but for all machines
     on the local network.  If no report has been received from a machine for
     11 minutes then rwho assumes the machine is down, and does not report
     users last known to be logged into that machine.

     If a user has not typed to the system for a minute or more, then rwho
     reports this idle time.

     The following option is available:

     -a      Include all users.  By default, if a user has not typed to the
             system for an hour or more, then the user will be omitted from
             the output.

FILES
     /var/rwho/whod.*  information about other machines

SEE ALSO
     ruptime(1), who(1), rwhod(8)

HISTORY
     The rwho command appeared in 4.3BSD.

BUGS
     This is unwieldy when the number of machines on the local net is large.
