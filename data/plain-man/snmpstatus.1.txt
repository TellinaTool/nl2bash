SNMPSTATUS(1)                      Net-SNMP                      SNMPSTATUS(1)



NAME
       snmpstatus  -  retrieves  a  fixed set of management information from a
       network entity

SYNOPSIS
       snmpstatus [COMMON OPTIONS] [-Cf] AGENT

DESCRIPTION
       snmpstatus is an SNMP application that retrieves several important sta-
       tistics from a network entity.

       AGENT  identifies a target SNMP agent, which is instrumented to monitor
       the given objects.  At its simplest, the AGENT specification will  con-
       sist  of  a hostname or an IPv4 address.  n this situation, the command
       will attempt communication with the agent, using UDP/IPv4 to  port  161
       of the given target host.

       See  the snmpcmd(1) manual page for a full list of the possible formats
       for AGENT.

       The information returned is:

              The IP address of the entity.
              A textual description of the entity (sysDescr.0)
              The uptime of the entity's SNMP agent (sysUpTime.0)
              The sum of received packets on all interfaces (ifInUCastPkts.* +
              ifInNUCastPkts.*)
              The  sum  of transmitted packets on all interfaces (ifOutUCastP-
              kts.* + ifOutNUCastPkts.*)
              The number of IP input packets (ipInReceives.0)
              The number of IP output packets (ipOutRequests.0)

       For example:

       snmpstatus -c public -v 1 netdev-kbox.cc.cmu.edu

       will produce output similar to the following:

       [128.2.56.220]=>[Kinetics FastPath2] Up: 1 day, 4:43:31
       Interfaces: 1,  Recv/Trans packets: 262874/39867 | IP: 31603/15805

       snmpstatus also checks the operational status of all interfaces  (ifOp-
       erStatus.*),  and  if it finds any that are not running, it will report
       in a manner similar to this:

       2 interfaces are down!

       If the network entity has an error processing the  request  packet,  an
       error  packet  will be returned and a message will be shown, helping to
       pinpoint in what  way  the  request  was  malformed.   snmpstatus  will
       attempt  to  reform  its  request  to  eliminate the malformed variable
       (unless the -Cf option is given, see below),  but  this  variable  will
       then be missing from the displayed data.


OPTIONS
       COMMON OPTIONS
              Please  see  snmpcmd(1) for a list of possible values for COMMON
              OPTIONS as well as their descriptions.

       -Cf    By default, snmpstatus will try to fix errors  returned  by  the
              agent  and  retry a request. In this situation, the command will
              display the data that it can. If the -Cf  option  is  specified,
              then  snmpstatus  will not try to fix errors, and the error will
              cause the command to terminate.
