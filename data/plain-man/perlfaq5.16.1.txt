       into nine major sections outlined in this document.

   Where to find the perlfaq
       The perlfaq is an evolving document.  Read the latest version at
       <http://learn.perl.org/faq/>.  It is also included in the standard Perl
       distribution.

   How to use the perlfaq
       The "perldoc" command line tool is part of the standard Perl
       distribution. To read the perlfaq:

           $ perldoc perlfaq

       decoding a URL and checking whether something is a number can be
       handled with regular expressions, but those answers are found elsewhere
       in this document (in perlfaq9 : "How do I decode or create those
       %-encodings on the web" and perlfaq4 : "How do I determine whether a
       scalar is a number/whole/integer/float", to be precise).
