DESCRIPTION
       Certtool  is  a  UNIX  command-line program which is used to create key
       pairs, certificates, and certificate signing requests; to import exter-
       nally  generated  certificates  and Certificate Revocation Lists (CRLs)
       into a Keychain, and to display the contents of certificates and  CRLs.

EXAMPLES
       Generating  a Self-Signed Certificate This command generates a key pair
       and a self-signed (root) certificate and places them in a keychain. The
       root  cert  is signed by the private key generated during this command.
       The cert generated by this command is totally untrustworthy and  cannot
       be  used  in  the  "real  world"; the primary use of this command is to
       facilitate early  development  of  SSL  server  applications  based  on
       SecureTransport.  In  particular,  "real  world" SSL clients (e.g., web
       browsers) will complain to varying degrees when they attempt to connect
       to  an SSL server which presents a cert which is generated by this com-
       mand. Some broswers, after a fair amount of handholding, will allow you
       to conditionally "trust" this cert.

              # CertTool c [options]
       The available options are:

              k=keyChainName
       Where  "keyChainName"  is  the name of the keychain into which keys and
       the cert will be added.  The  specified  keychain  must  exist.  If  it
       doesn't  exist  and  you want the keychain created for you, specify the
       'c' option. If no keychain is specified, keys and certs  are  added  to
       the default keychain.

              c
       Specifies that the designated keychain is to be created.

              x=[aSsm]
       Specifies  an optional Extended Key Usage extension. Values are 'a' for
       ExtendedKeyUseAny; 's' for SSL client (ClientAuth); 'S' for SSL  server
       (ServerAuth); and 'm' for S/MIME (EmailProtection).

              a
       Results  the  the  private key being created with a default ACL. If not
       specified, the private key is created with no ACL.

              u
       Create the private key with an ACL limiting access to the current user.
       This  is  an  interactive command; you will be prompted for a number of
       different items which are used to generate the keypair and the cert.  A
       sample session follows.

              # CertTool k=certkc
              Enter key and certificate label: testCert

              Please specify parameters for the key pair you will generate.

                   r RSA
                   d DSA
                   f FEE

              Select key algorithm by letter: r

              Valid key sizes for RSA are 512..2048; default is 512
              Enter key size in bits or CR for default: 512

              You have selected algorithm RSA, key size 512 bits.
              OK (y/anything)? y
              Enter cert/key usage (s=signing, b=signing AND encrypting): b
               ...Generating key pair...

       Note:  you  will  be prompted for the Keychain's passphrase by the Key-
       chain system at this point if the specified keychain is  not  open  and
       you have not specified the passphrase via the 'p' option.

              Please specify the algorithm with which your certificate will be signed.

                   5 RSA with MD5
                   s RSA with SHA1

              Select signature algorithm by letter: s

              You have selected algorithm RSA with SHA1.
              OK (y/anything)? y
       You  will now specify the various components of the certificate's Rela-
       tive Distinguished Name (RDN). An RDN has a number of  components,  all
       of which are optional, but at least one of which must be present.  Note
       that if you are creating a certificate for use in  an  SSL/TLS  server,
       the  Common  Name component of the RDN must match exactly the host name
       of the server. This must not be an IP address, but  the  actual  domain
       name,  e.g.  www.apple.com.   Entering  a  CR for a given RDN component
       results in no value for that component.

              Common Name       (e.g. www.apple.com) : 10.0.61.5
              Country           (e.g. US) :
              Organization      (e.g. Apple Computer, Inc.) : Apple
              Organization Unit (e.g. Apple Data Security) :
              State/Province    (e.g. California) : California
              Email Address     (e.g. johngalt@rand.com) :
              You have specified:
               Common Name   : 10.0.61.5
               Organization  : Apple
               State/Province : California
              Is this OK (y/anything)? y
              #
       The "Common Name" portion of the RDN - in the above case, "10.0.61.5" -
       MUST  match  the  host name of the machine you'll be running an SSL/TLS
       server on. (In this case the test machine doesn't have an actual  host-
       name; it's DHCP'd behind a firewall which is why "10.0.61.5" was speci-
       fied for Common Name.) This is part of SSL's certificate  verification;
       it  prevents an attack using DNS spoofing.  A brief note about cert/key
       usage: the normal configuration of SecureTransport is that  the  server
       cert  specified  in  SSLSetCertificate() is capable of both signing and
       encryption. If this cert is only capable of signing, you must create  a
       second  keychain  containing a cert which is capable of encryption, and
       pass that to SSLSetEncryptionCertificate().  Generating  a  Certificate
       Signing  Request (CSR) A CSR is the standard means by which an adminis-
       trator of a web server provides information to a Certificate  Authority
       (CA)  in order to obtain a valid certificate which is signed by the CA.
       This type of cert is used in the real world; certs signed by  CAs  such
       as  Verisign  and  Thawte are recognized by most web browsers when per-
       forming SSL transactions.  The general procedure for obtaining a "real"
       cert is:

       o      Generate a key pair

       o      Generate a CSR

       o      Provide  the CSR and some other information and/or documentation
              to the CA

       o      CA sends you a certificate which is signed by the CA.

       o      You import that certificate, obtained from  the  CA,  into  your
              keychain.  The items in that keychain can now be used in Secure-
              Transport's SSLSetCertificate() call.  This command performs the
              first  two  steps  in the above procedure. See the section below
              entitled "Importing a Certificate" for information on  importing
              the resulting certificate into your keychain. The format of this
              command is

              # CertTool r outFileName [options]
       The resulting CSR will be  written  to  "outFileName".   The  available
       options are:

              k=keyChainName
       Where  "KeyChainName"  is  the name of the keychain into which keys and
       the cert will be added. If no keychain is specified, keys and certs are
       added to the default keychain. The specified keychain must exist unless
       you specify the 'c' option.

               d
       The 'd' option tells CertTool to create the CSR in DER-encoded  format.
       The  default is PEM-encoded, which is what most CAs expect. PEM encoded
       data consists of printable ASCII text which can, for example, be pasted
       into an email message.  DER-encoded data is nonprintable binary data.

               c
       Specifies that the designated keychain is to be created.

              a
       Results  the  the  private key being created with a default ACL. If not
       specified, the private key is created with no ACL.

              u
       Create the private key with an ACL limiting access to the current user.
       This  is  an  interactive command; you will be prompted for a number of
       different items which are used to generate the keypair and the CSR. The
       prompts  given, and the format of the data you must supply, are identi-
       cal to the data shown in the sample session in Section 2.  Verifying  a
       CSR A CSR contains, among other things, the public key which was gener-
       ated in as described above. The CSR is signed with the associated  pri-
       vate key. Thus the integrity of a CSR can be verified by extracting its
       public key and verifying the signature of the CSR.  This  command  per-
       forms this integrity check. The format of this command is

              # CertTool v inFileName [options]
       The  only available option is the 'd' flag, which as described above in
       the section entitled "Generating a Certificate Signing Request",  indi-
       ciates  that  the CSR is in DER format rather than the default PEM for-
       mat.  A typical (successful) run of this command is like so:

              # CertTool v myCsr.pem
               ...CSR verified successfully.
       A large number of things can go wrong if the verification  fails;  suf-
       fice  it  to  say that if you see anything other than the above success
       message, you have a bad or corrupted CSR.  Creating a  System  Identity
       This  creates  a  key  pair and a self-signed (root) certificate in the
       System keychain, and registers the result in the System Identity  data-
       base  as  being the IDentity associated with the specified domain name.
       The domain name is typically a string of  the  form  "com.apple.somedo-
       main...".  You  must  be  running as root to execute this command.  The
       format of this command is

              # CertTool C domainName [options]
       The available options are:

              u
       Create the private key with an ACL limiting access to the current user.
       If not specified, the private key wil be created with a default ACL.

              P
       Don't  create  system  identity  if  one  already  exists for specified
       domain.  Importing a Certificate from a Certificate Authority Once  you
       have  negotiated with your CA, and provided them with the CSR generated
       as described above as well as any other information, documentation, and
       payment  they  require, the CA will provide you with a certificate. Use
       this command to add that certificate to  the  keychain  containing  the
       keypair you generated previously.  The format of this command is

              # CertTool i inFileName [options]
       The cert to import is obtained from "inFileName". The available options
       are:

              k=keyChainName
       Where "keyChainName" is the name of the keychain to which the cert will
       be added. If no keychain is specified, the cert is added to the default
       keychain.  The specified keychain typically contains  the  keypair  you
       generated  previously.   (Note you can import a certificate into a key-
       chain which does not contain keys you generated but there  will  be  no
       linkage  between  the  imported certificate and a private key if you do
       this.) If the keychain is not open when this command is  executed,  you
       will be prompted by the Keychain system for its passphrase.

              r=privateKeyFileName
       Where "privateKeyFileName" is the name of the optional private key file
       to imported along with the certificate. This option is used  to  import
       cert/key pairs which are generated by other means, such as OpenSSL.

              f=privateKeyFormat
       Where  "privateKeyFormat"  is  the  format of the private key specified
       with the 'r' option. The formats are: '1' for PKCS1  (OpenSSL  format),
       '8'  (PKCS8),  and  'f' (FIPS186, BSAFE format). The default is OpenSSL
       format for both RSA and DSA keys.

               d
       Specifies DER format as described above. The default is PEM format.

               c
       Specifies that the designated keychain is to be created.  Displaying  a
       Certificate  This  displays  the  contents  of an existing certificate,
       obtained from a file.  The format of this command is

              # CertTool d inFileName [options]
       The cert to display is obtained from "inFileName".  The only  available
       option  is  the 'd' flag, specifying DER format as described above. The
       default is PEM format. Actually, in the absence of this  option,  cert-
       tool  will  correctly  determine  the format of the certificate (PEM or
       DER).  Importing a CRL This command is used to add a Certificate  Revo-
       cation List (CRL) to a keychain.  The format of this command is

              # CertTool I inFileName [options]
       The CRL to import is obtained from "inFileName".  The available options
       are:

              k=keyChainName
       Where "KeyChainName" is the name of the keychain to which the CRL  will
       be  added.   If  no  keychain  is  specified,  the cert is added to the
       default keychain.  If the keychain is not open  when  this  command  is
       executed,  you  will  be  prompted  by  the  Keychain  system  for  its
       passphrase.

               d
       Specifies DER format as described above. The default is PEM format.

               c
       Specifies that the designated keychain is to be created.  Displaying  a
       CRL  This  displays  the contents of an existing Certificate Revocation
       List (CRL), obtained from a file. The format of this command is

              # CertTool D inFileName [options]
       The cert to display is obtained from "inFileName".  The only  available
       option  is  the 'd' flag, specifying DER format as described above. The
       default is PEM format.  Displaying Certificates and CRLs in a  keychain
       This  displays the contents of all certificates and CRLs in a keychain.
       The format of this command is

              # CertTool y [options]
       The available options are:

              k=keyChainName
       Where "KeyChainName" is the name of the keychain to display.

              v
       Specifies verbose mode.  Certificate Authorities and CSRs As  mentioned
       above, the general procedure for obtaining a "real" cert is:

       o      Generate a key pair

       o      Generate a CSR

       o      Provide  the CSR and some other information and/or documentation
              to the CA

       o      CA sends you a certificate which is signed by the CA.

       o      You import that certificate, obtained from  the  CA,  into  your
              keychain.  The items in that keychain can now be used in Secure-
              Transpoert's SSLSetCertificate() call.  One CA with an excellent
              web-based   interface   for   obtaining   a   cert  is  Verisign
              (http://www.verisign.com/products/site/index.html). You can  get
              a  free  14-day  trial  certificate  using nothing but CertTool,
              Verisign's web site, and email.  You need to provide  some  per-
              sonal  information.  Paste the CSR generated as described in the
              section entitled "Generating a Certificate Signing Request" into
              a  form on the web site. A few minutes later Verisign emails you
              a certificate, which you import into your keychain.   The  whole
              process  takes  less  than  10  minutes.  The  free  certificate
              obtained in this manner is signed by a temporary root cert which
              is  not recognized by any browsers, but Verisign also provides a
              means of installing this temporary root cert into your  browser,
              directly  from their web site. Typically one would use the free,
              temporary cert to perform initial configuration of a server  and
              to  ring  out the general SSL infrastructure. Once you feel com-
              fortable with the operation of the server, then it's time to buy
              a  "real"  certificate  which  will  allow your web server to be
              trusted by any browser.  Thawte has  a  similar,  very  friendly
              service  at  http://www.thawte.com/.   Note  that, for early web
              server development and/or testing, you can skip the entire  pro-
              cedure  described  above  and just generate your own self-signed
              root cert as described above. No CA is involved; no CSR is  gen-
              erated; no cert needs to be imported - CertTool generates a cert
              for you and immediately adds it to your keychain. Bear  in  mind
              that  this  option will require support from various SSL clients
              you'll be testing with, none of which recognize your root  cert.
