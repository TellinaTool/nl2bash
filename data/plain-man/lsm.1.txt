LSM(1)                      Latent Semantic Mapping                     LSM(1)



NAME
       lsm - Latent Semantic Mapping tool

SYNOPSIS
       lsm lsm_command [command_options] map_file [input_files]

DESCRIPTION
       The Latent Semantic Mapping framework is a language independent,
       Unicode based technology that builds maps and uses them to classify
       texts into one of a number of categories.

       lsm is a tool to create, manipulate, test, and dump Latent Semantic
       Mapping maps. It is designed to provide access to a large subset of the
       functionality of the Latent Semantic Mapping API, mainly for rapid
       prototyping and diagnostic purposes, but possibly also for simple shell
       script based applications of Latent Semantic Mapping.

COMMANDS
       lsm provides a variety of commands (lsm_command in the Synopsis), each
       of which often has a wealth of options (see the Command Options below).
       Command names may be abbreviated to unambiguous prefixes.

       lsm create map_file input_files
           Create a new LSM map from the specified input_files.

       lsm update map_file input_files
           Add the specified input_files to an existing LSM map.

       lsm evaluate map_file input_files
           Classify the specified input_files into the categories of the LSM
           map.

       lsm cluster [--k-means=N | --agglomerative=N] [--apply]
           Compute clusters for the map, and, if the --apply option is
           specified, transform the map accordingly. Multiple levels of
           clustering may be applied for faster performance on large maps,
           e.g.

              lsm cluster --k-means=100 --each --agglomerative=100 --agglomerative=1000 my.map

           first computes 100 clusters using (fast) k-means clustering,
           computes 100 subclusters for each first stage cluster using
           agglomerative clustering, and finally reduces those 10000 clusters
           to 1000 using agglomerative clustering.

       lsm dump map_file [input_files]
           Without input_files, dumps all words in the map with their counts.
           With input_files, dump, for each file, the words that appear in the
           map, their counts in the map, and their relative frequencies in the
           input file.

       lsm info map_file
           Bypass the Latent Semantic Mapping framework to extract and print
           information about the file and perform a number of consistency
           checks on it. (NOT IMPLEMENTED YET)

COMMAND OPTIONS
       This section describes the command_options that are available for the
       lsm commands. Not all commands support all of these options; each
       option is only supported for commands where it makes sense.  However,
       when a command has one of these options you can count on the same
       meaning for the option as in other commands.

       --append-categories
           Directs the update command to put the data into new categories
           appended after the existing ones, instead of adding the data to the
           existing categories.

       --categories count
           Directs the evaluate command to only list the top count categories.

       --category-delimiter delimiter
           Specify the delimiter to be used to between categories in the
           input_files passed to the create and update commands.

           group   Categories are separated by a `;' argument.

           file    Each input_file represents a separate category. This is the
                   default if the --category-delimiter option is not given.

           line    Each line represents a separate category.

           string  Categories are separated by the specified string.

       --clobber
           When creating a map, overwrite an existing file at the path, even
           if it's not an LSM map.  By default, create will only overwrite an
           existing file if it's believed to be an LSM map, which guards
           against frequent operator errors such as:

              lsm create /usr/include/*.h

       --dimensions dim
           Direct the create and update commands to use the given number of
           dimensions for computing the map (Defaults to the number of
           categories). This option is useful to manage the size and
           computational overhead of maps with large number of categories.

       --discard-counts
           Direct the create and update commands to omit the raw word / token
           counts when writing the map. This results in a map that is more
           compact, but cannot be updated any further.

       --hash
           Direct the create and update commands to write the map in a format
           that is not human readable with default file manipulation tools
           like cat or hexdump. This is useful in applications such as junk
           mail filtering, where input data may contain naughty words and
           where the contents of the map may tip off spammers what words to
           avoid.

       --help
           List an overview of the options available for a command. Available
           for all commands.

       --html
           Strip HTML codes from the input_files. Useful for mail and web
           input. Available for the create, update, evaluate, and dump
           commands.

       --junk-mail
           When parsing the input files, apply heuristics to counteract common
           methods used by spammers to disguise incriminating words such as:

              Zer0 1nt3rest l0ans     Substituting letters with digits
              W E A L T H             Adding spaces between letters
              m.o.r.t.g.a.g.e         Adding punctuation between letters

           Available for the create, update, evaluate, and dump commands.

       --pairs
           If specified with the create command when building the map, store
           counts for pairs of words as well as the words themselves. This can
           increase accuracy for certain classes of problems, but will
           generate unreasonably large maps unless the vocabulary is fairly
           limited.

       --stop-words stop_word_file
           If specified with the create command, stop_word_file is parsed and
           all words found are excluded from texts evaluated against the map.
           This is useful for excluding frequent, semantically meaningless
           words.

       --sweep-cutoff threshold
       --sweep-frequency days
           Available for the create and update commands. Every specified
           number of days (by default 7), scan the map and remove from it any
           entries that have been in the map for at least 2 previous scans and
           whose total counts are smaller than threshold.  threshold defaults
           to 0, so by default the map is not scanned.

       --text-delimiter delimiter
           Specify the delimiter to be used to between texts in the
           input_files passed to the create, update, evaluate, and dump
           commands.

           file    Each input_file represents a separate text. This is the
                   default if the --text-delimiter option is not given.

           line    Each line represents a separate text.

           string  Texts are separated by the specified string.

       --triplets
           If specified with the create command when building the map, store
           counts for triplets and pairs of words as well as the words
           themselves. This can increase accuracy for certain classes of
           problems, but will generate unreasonably large maps unless the
           vocabulary is fairly limited.

       --weight weight
           Scale counts of input words for the create and update commands by
           the specified weight, which may be a positive or negative floating
           point number.

       --words
           Directs the evaluate or cluster commands to apply to words, instead
           of categories.

       --words=count
           Directs the evaluate command to list the top count words, instead
           of categories.

EXAMPLES

       msg*.txt"
           Simulate the Mail.app junk mail filter by evaluating the specified
           files (assumed to each hold the raw text of one mail message)
           against the user's junk mail map.

       "lsm dump ~/Library/Mail/V2/MailData/LSMMap2"
           Dump the words accumulated in the junk mail map and their counts.

       "lsm create --category-delimiter=group c_vs_h *.c ';' *.h"
           Create an LSM map trained to distinguish C header files from C
           source files.

       "lsm update --weight 2.0 --cat=group c_vs_h ';' ../xy/*.h"
           Add some additional header files with an increased weight to the
           training.

       "lsm create --help"
           List the options available for the lsm create command.
