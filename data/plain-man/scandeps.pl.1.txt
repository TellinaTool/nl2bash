NAME
       scandeps.pl - Scan file prerequisites

SYNOPSIS
           % scandeps.pl *.pm          # Print PREREQ_PM section for *.pm
           % scandeps.pl -e 'STRING'   # Scan an one-liner
           % scandeps.pl -B *.pm       # Include core modules
           % scandeps.pl -V *.pm       # Show autoload/shared/data files
           % scandeps.pl -R *.pm       # Don't recurse
           % scandeps.pl -C CACHEFILE  # use CACHEFILE to cache dependencies

DESCRIPTION
       scandeps.pl is a simple-minded utility that prints out the "PREREQ_PM"
       section needed by modules.

       If you have CPANPLUS installed, modules that are part of an earlier
       module's distribution with be denoted with "S"; modules without a
       distribution name on CPAN are marked with "?".

       Also, if the "-B" option is specified, module belongs to a perl
       distribution on CPAN (and thus uninstallable by "CPAN.pm" or
       "CPANPLUS.pm") are marked with "C".

       Finally, modules that has loadable shared object files (usually needing
       a compiler to install) are marked with "X"; with the "-V" flag, those
       files (and all other files found) will be listed before the main
       output. Additionally, all module files that the scanned code depends on
       but were not found (and thus not scanned recursively) are listed. These
       may include genuinely missing modules or false positives. That means,
       modules your code does not depend on (on this particular platform) but
       that were picked up by the heuristic anyway.

OPTIONS
       -e STRING
           Scan STRING as a string containing perl code.

       -c  Compiles the code and inspects its %INC, in addition to static
           scanning.

       -x  Executes the code and inspects its %INC, in addition to static
           scanning.

       -B  Include core modules in the output and the recursive search list.

       -R  Only show dependencies found in the files listed and do not
           recurse.

       -V  Verbose mode: Output all files found during the process; show
           dependencies between modules and availability.

           Additionally, warns of any missing dependencies. If you find
           missing dependencies that aren't really dependencies, you have
           probably found false positives.

       -C CACHEFILE
           Use CACHEFILE to speed up the scanning process by caching
           dependencies.  Creates CACHEFILE if it does not exist yet.
