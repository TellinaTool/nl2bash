DESCRIPTION
       lookbib prints a prompt on the  standard  error  (unless  the  standard
       input is not a terminal), reads from the standard input a line contain-
       ing a set of keywords, searches the bibliographic databases filename...
       for  references  containing those keywords, prints any references found
       on the standard output, and repeats  this  process  until  the  end  of
       input.   For  each  database filename to be searched, if an index file-
       name.i created by indxbib(1) exists, then it will be searched  instead;
       each index can cover multiple databases.
