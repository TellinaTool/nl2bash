OSALANG(1)                BSD General Commands Manual               OSALANG(1)

NAME
     osalang -- information about installed OSA languages

SYNOPSIS
     osalang [-dlL]

DESCRIPTION
     osalang prints information about installed OSA languages.  With no
     options, it prints an unadorned list of language names to standard out-
     put.  These names can be passed to the -l options of osacompile(1) and
     osascript(1).  The options are as follows:

     -d    Only print the default language.

     -l    List in long format.  For each language, osalang will print its
           component subtype, manufacturer, and capability flags.  There are
           eight groups of optional routines that scripting components can
           support.  Each flag is either a letter, meaning the group is sup-
           ported, or `-', meaning it is not.  The letters map to the follow-
           ing groups:

                 c     compiling scripts.
                 g     getting source data.
                 x     coercing script values.
                 e     manipulating the event create and send functions.
                 r     recording scripts.
                 v     ``convenience'' APIs to execute scripts in one step.
                 d     manipulating dialects.
                 h     using scripts to handle Apple Events.

           For descriptions of the groups and the APIs in each of them, see
           <http://developer.apple.com/documentation/mac/IAC/IAC-361.html>.

     -L    Same as -l, but also prints the description of each component after
           its name.
