NAME
       grolj4 - groff driver for HP Laserjet 4 family

SYNOPSIS
       grolj4 [ -lv ] [ -d[n] ] [ -cn ] [ -ppaper_size ] [ -wn ] [ -Fdir ]
              [ files... ]

       It is possible to have whitespace between a command line option and its
       parameter.

DESCRIPTION
       grolj4  is a driver for groff that produces output in PCL5 format suit-
       able for an HP Laserjet 4 printer.

       There is an additional drawing command available:

       \D'R dh dv'
              Draw a rule (solid black rectangle), with one corner at the cur-
              rent position, and the diagonally opposite corner at the current
              position +(dh,dv).  Afterwards the current position will  be  at
              the  opposite  corner.  This generates a PCL fill rectangle com-
              mand, and so will work on printers that do  not  support  HPGL/2
              unlike the other \D commands.

OPTIONS
       -cn    Print n copies of each page.

       -l     Print the document with a landscape orientation.

       -d [n] Use duplex mode n: 1 is long-side binding; 2 is short-side bind-
              ing; default is 1.

       -psize Set the paper size to size, which must be one of letter,  legal,
              executive, a4, com10, monarch, c5, b5, dl.

       -v     Print the version number.

       -wn    Set  the  default  line thickness to n thousandths of an em.  If
              this option isn't specified,  the  line  thickness  defaults  to
              0.04 em.

       -Fdir  Prepend  directory  dir/devname  to the search path for font and
              device description files; name is the name of the  device,  usu-
              ally lj4.

       The  following  four  commands  are  available additionally in the font
       description files:

       pclweight N
              The integer value N must be in the range -7 to +7; default is 0.

       pclstyle N
              The  integer value N must be in the range 0 to 32767; default is
              0.

       pclproportional N
              A boolean flag which can be either 0 or 1; default is 0.

       pcltypeface N
              The integer value N must be in the range 0 to 65535; default  is
              0.
