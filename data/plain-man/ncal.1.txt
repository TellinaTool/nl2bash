CAL(1)                    BSD General Commands Manual                   CAL(1)

NAME
     cal, ncal -- displays a calendar and the date of easter

SYNOPSIS
     cal [-jy] [[month] year]
     cal [-j] -m month [year]
     ncal [-jJpwy] [-s country_code] [[month] year]
     ncal [-Jeo] [year]

DESCRIPTION
     The cal utility displays a simple calendar in traditional format and ncal
     offers an alternative layout, more options and the date of easter.  The
     new format is a little cramped but it makes a year fit on a 25x80 termi-
     nal.  If arguments are not specified, the current month is displayed.

     The options are as follows:

     -J      Display Julian Calendar, if combined with the -e option, display
             date of easter according to the Julian Calendar.

     -e      Display date of easter (for western churches).

     -j      Display Julian days (days one-based, numbered from January 1).

     -m month
             Display the specified month.

     -o      Display date of orthodox easter (Greek and Russian Orthodox
             Churches).

     -p      Print the country codes and switching days from Julian to Grego-
             rian Calendar as they are assumed by ncal.  The country code as
             determined from the local environment is marked with an asterisk.

     -s country_code
             Assume the switch from Julian to Gregorian Calendar at the date
             associated with the country_code.  If not specified, ncal tries
             to guess the switch date from the local environment or falls back
             to September 2, 1752.  This was when Great Britain and her
             colonies switched to the Gregorian Calendar.

     -w      Print the number of the week below each week column.

     -y      Display a calendar for the specified year.

     A single parameter specifies the year (1 - 9999) to be displayed; note
     the year must be fully specified: ``cal 89'' will not display a calendar
     for 1989.  Two parameters denote the month and year; the month is either
     a number between 1 and 12, or a full or abbreviated name as specified by
     the current locale.  Month and year default to those of the current sys-
     tem clock and time zone (so ``cal -m 8'' will display a calendar for the
     month of August in the current year).

     A year starts on Jan 1.

BUGS
     The assignment of Julian--Gregorian switching dates to country codes is
     historically naive for many countries.
