NAME
       newproc.d - snoop new processes. Uses DTrace.

SYNOPSIS
       newproc.d

DESCRIPTION
       newproc.d  is a DTrace OneLiner to snoop new processes as they are run.
       The argument listing is printed.

       This is useful to identify short lived processes that are usually  dif-
       ficult to spot using traditional tools.

       Docs/oneliners.txt   and  Docs/Examples/oneliners_examples.txt  in  the
       DTraceToolkit contain this as a oneliner that  can  be  cut-n-paste  to
       run.

       Since  this  uses  DTrace, only users with root privileges can run this
       command.

EXAMPLES
       This prints new processes until Ctrl-C is hit.
              # newproc.d
