NAME
     iconutil -- Utility to convert between '.iconset' and '.icns' files.

SYNOPSIS
     iconutil -c {icns | iconset} [-o file] file

DESCRIPTION
     iconutil converts between '.iconset' and '.icns' files. The tool takes a
     single source '.icns' file or '.iconset' and converts it to either a
     '.icns' or '.iconset' depending on the value of the -c flag's argument.
     It is possible to specify the name of the output file by passing the file
     path as the argument to the -o flag. If -o is not set iconutil will write
     converted '.icns' file or '.iconset' to the same directory as the source
     file using the same file name with the correct extension for the output
     type.

OPTIONS
     -c --convert {icns | iconset}
              Given the argument iconset, iconutil converts the source '.icns'
              file to an '.iconset'.  The '.iconset' is saved in the same
              directory as the source '.icns'. It is given the same file name
              as but with the '.iconset' file extension.  If the argument is
              icns, iconutil converts the source '.iconset' to an '.icns'.
              The '.icns' is saved in the same directory as the source '.icon-
              set'. It is given the same file name as the source file but with
              the '.iconset' file extension.

     -o --output
              Overrides the default output file name that iconutil uses to
              save the converted '.iconset' or '.icns' files.
