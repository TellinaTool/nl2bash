NAME
       encode_keychange - produce the KeyChange string for SNMPv3

SYNOPSIS
       encode_keychange -t md5|sha1 [OPTIONS]

DESCRIPTION
       encode_keychange  produces  a  KeyChange  string  using the old and new
       passphrases as described in Section 5 of RFC 2274 "User-based  Security
       Model  (USM)  for  version  3 of the Simple Network Management Protocol
       (SNMPv3)". -t option is mandatory and specifies the hash transform type
       to use.

       The  transform  is used to convert passphrase to master key for a given
       user (Ku), convert master key to the localized key (Kul), and  to  hash
       the old Kul with the random bits.

       Passphrases are obtained by examining a number of sources until success
       (in order listed):

              command line options (see -N and -O options below);

              the file $HOME/.snmp/passphrase.ek which should only contain two
              lines with old and new passphrase;

              standard input -or-  user input from the terminal.



OPTIONS
       -E [0x]<engineID> EngineID used for Kul generation.
              <engineID>  is  intepreted as a hex string when preceeded by 0x,
              otherwise it is treated as a text string. If  no  <engineID>  is
              specified,  it  is constructed from the first IP address for the
              local host.

       -f     Force passphrases to be read from standard input.

       -h     Display the help message.

       -N "<new_passphrase>"
              Passphrase used to generate the new Ku.

       -O "<old_passphrase>"
              Passphrase used to generate the old Ku.

       -P     Turn off the prompt for passphrases when getting data from stan-
              dard input.

       -v     Be verbose.

       -V     Echo passphrases to terminal.
