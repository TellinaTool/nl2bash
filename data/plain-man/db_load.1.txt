db_load(1)                BSD General Commands Manual               db_load(1)

NAME
     db_load

SYNOPSIS
     db_load [-nTV] [-c name=value] [-f file] [-h home] [-P password]
             [-t btree | hash | queue | recno] file

DESCRIPTION
     The db_load utility reads from the standard input and loads it into the
     database file. The database file is created if it does not already exist.

     The input to db_load must be in the output format specified by the
     db_dump utility, utilities, or as specified for the -T below.

     The options are as follows:

     -c
        Specify configuration options ignoring any value they may have based
        on the input. The command-line format is name=value. See the Supported
        Keywords section below for a list of keywords supported by the -c
        option.

     -f
        Read from the specified input file instead of from the standard input.

     -h
        Specify a home directory for the database environment.

        If a home directory is specified, the database environment is opened
        using the Db.DB_INIT_LOCK, Db.DB_INIT_LOG, Db.DB_INIT_MPOOL,
        Db.DB_INIT_TXN, and Db.DB_USE_ENVIRON flags to DB_ENV->open. (This
        means that db_load can be used to load data into databases while they
        are in use by other processes.) If the DB_ENV->open call fails, or if
        no home directory is specified, the database is still updated, but the
        environment is ignored; for example, no locking is done.

     -n
        Do not overwrite existing keys in the database when loading into an
        already existing database. If a key/data pair cannot be loaded into
        the database for this reason, a warning message is displayed on the
        standard error output, and the key/data pair are skipped.

     -P
        Specify an environment password. Although Berkeley DB utilities over-
        write password strings as soon as possible, be aware there may be a
        window of vulnerability on systems where unprivileged users can see
        command-line arguments or where utilities are not able to overwrite
        the memory containing the command-line arguments.

     -T
        The -T option allows non-Berkeley DB applications to easily load text
        files into databases.

        If the database to be created is of type Btree or Hash, or the keyword
        keys is specified as set, the input must be paired lines of text,
        where the first line of the pair is the key item, and the second line
        of the pair is its corresponding data item. If the database to be cre-
        ated is of type Queue or Recno and the keyword keys is not set, the
        input must be lines of text, where each line is a new data item for
        the database.

        A simple escape mechanism, where newline and backslash ( characters
        are special, is applied to the text input. Newline characters are
        interpreted as record separators. Backslash characters in the text
        will be interpreted in one of two ways: If the backslash character
        precedes another backslash character, the pair will be interpreted as
        a literal backslash. If the backslash character precedes any other
        character, the two characters following the backslash will be inter-
        preted as a hexadecimal specification of a single character; for exam-
        ple,  a is a newline character in the ASCII character set.

        For this reason, any backslash or newline characters that naturally
        occur in the text input must be escaped to avoid misinterpretation by
        db_load.

        If the -T option is specified, the underlying access method type must
        be specified using the -t option.

     -t
        Specify the underlying access method. If no -t option is specified,
        the database will be loaded into a database of the same type as was
        dumped; for example, a Hash database will be created if a Hash data-
        base was dumped.

        Btree and Hash databases may be converted from one to the other. Queue
        and Recno databases may be converted from one to the other. If the -k
        option was specified on the call to db_dump then Queue and Recno data-
        bases may be converted to Btree or Hash, with the key being the inte-
        ger record number.

     -V
        Write the library version number to the standard output, and exit.

     The db_load utility may be used with a Berkeley DB environment (as
     described for the -h option, the environment variable DB_HOME, or because
     the utility was run in a directory containing a Berkeley DB environment).
     In order to avoid environment corruption when using a Berkeley DB envi-
     ronment, db_load should always be given the chance to detach from the
     environment and exit gracefully. To cause db_load to release all environ-
     ment resources and exit cleanly, send it an interrupt signal (SIGINT).

     The db_load utility exits 0 on success, 1 if one or more key/data pairs
     were not loaded into the database because the key already existed, and >1
     if an error occurs.

EXAMPLES
     The db_load utility can be used to load text files into databases. For
     example, the following command loads the standard UNIX /etc/passwd file
     into a database, with the login name as the key item and the entire pass-
     word entry as the data item:

     awk -F: '{print $1; print $0}' < /etc/passwd |
         sed 's/\/\\/g' | db_load -T -t hash passwd.db

     Note that backslash characters naturally occurring in the text are
     escaped to avoid interpretation as escape characters by db_load.

ENVIRONMENT
     DB_HOME  If the -h option is not specified and the environment variable
              DB_HOME is set, it is used as the path of the database home, as
              described in DB_ENV->open.
