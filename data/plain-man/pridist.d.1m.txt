NAME
       pridist.d - process priority distribution. Uses DTrace.

SYNOPSIS
       pridist.d

DESCRIPTION
       This is a simple DTrace script that samples at 1000 Hz which process is
       on the CPUs, and what the priority is. A distribution plot is  printed.

       With  priorities, the higher the priority the better chance the process
       (actually, thread) has of being scheduled.

       This idea came from the script /usr/demo/dtrace/profpri.d,  which  pro-
       duces similar output for one particular PID.

       Since  this  uses  DTrace, only users with root privileges can run this
       command.

EXAMPLES
       This samples until Ctrl-C is hit.
              # pridist.d


FIELDS
       CMD    process name

       PID    process ID

       value  process priority

       count  number of samples of at least this priority


BASED ON
       /usr/demo/dtrace/profpri.d
