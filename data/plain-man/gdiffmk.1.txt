NAME
       gdiffmk - mark differences between groff/nroff/troff files

SYNOPSIS
       gdiffmk [ -aaddmark ] [ -cchangemark ] [ -ddeletemark ] [ -D [ -B ]
               [ -Mmark1 mark2 ] ] [ -xdiffcmd ] [ -- ] [ --help ]
               [ --version ] file1 file2 [ output ]

DESCRIPTION
       gdiffmk  compares  two groff(1), nroff(1), or troff(1) documents, file1
       and file2, and creates an output which  is  file2  with  added  `margin
       character' (.mc) commands that indicate the differences.

       If  the output filename is present, the output is written there.  If it
       is - or absent the output is written to the standard output.

       If the file1 or file2 argument is - the standard input is read for that
       input.  Clearly both cannot be -.

       Note that the output is not necessarily compatible with all macro pack-
       ages and all preprocessors.  See the BUGS section below.

OPTIONS
       -aaddmark
              Use the addmark for source lines not in  file1  but  present  in
              file2.  Default: +.

       -B     By  default,  the deleted texts marked by the -D option end with
              an added troff break command, .br, to ensure that the  deletions
              are  marked  properly.   This  is the only way to guarantee that
              deletions and small changes get flagged.   This  option  directs
              the program not to insert these breaks; it makes no sense to use
              it without -D.

       -cchangemark
              Use the changemark for changed source lines.  Default: |.

       -ddeletemark
              Use the deletemark for deleted source lines.  Default: *.

       -D     Show  the  deleted  portions  from  changed  and  deleted  text.
              Default delimiting marks: [[ .... ]].

       -Mmark1 mark2
              Change  the  delimiting  marks  for  the -D option.  It makes no
              sense to use this option without -D.

       -xdiffcmd
              Use the diffcmd command to perform the comparison of  file1  and
              file2.  In particular, diffcmd should accept the GNU diff -Dname
              option.  Default: diff(1).

       --     All the following arguments are treated as file names,  even  if
              they begin with -.

       --help Print a usage message on standard error output and exit.

       --version
              Print version information on the standard output and exit.

BUGS
       The  output  is  not necessarily compatible with all macro packages and
       all preprocessors.  A workaround that is often successful against  pre-
       processor  problems  is  to  run  gdiffmk on the output of all the pre-
       processors instead of the input source.

       gdiffmk relies on the -Dname option of GNU diff(1)  to  make  a  merged
       `#ifdef'  output  format.  It hasn't been tested whether other versions
       of diff(1) do support this option.  See also the -xdiffcmd option.

       Report bugs to bug-groff@gnu.org.  Include a  complete,  self-contained
       example that will allow the bug to be reproduced, and say which version
       of gdiffmk you are using.
