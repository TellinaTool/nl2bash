DESCRIPTION
       ldapsearch is a shell-accessible interface  to  the  ldap_search_ext(3)
       library call.

       ldapsearch  opens a connection to an LDAP server, binds, and performs a
       search using specified parameters.   The filter should conform  to  the
       string  representation  for  search filters as defined in RFC 4515.  If
       not provided, the default filter, (objectClass=*), is used.

       If ldapsearch finds one or more entries, the  attributes  specified  by
       attrs  are returned.  If * is listed, all user attributes are returned.
       If + is listed, all operational attributes are returned.  If  no  attrs
       are  listed,  all user attributes are returned.  If only 1.1 is listed,
       no attributes will be returned.

       The search results are displayed using an  extended  version  of  LDIF.
       Option -L controls the format of the output.

OPTIONS
       -n     Show  what would be done, but don't actually perform the search.
              Useful for debugging in conjunction with -v.

       -c     Continuous operation mode. Errors are reported,  but  ldapsearch
              will  continue  with  searches.  The  default  is  to exit after
              reporting an error.  Only useful in conjunction with -f.

       -u     Include the User Friendly Name form of  the  Distinguished  Name
              (DN) in the output.

       -v     Run  in  verbose mode, with many diagnostics written to standard
              output.

       -t[t]  A single -t writes retrieved non-printable values to  a  set  of
              temporary  files.   This  is useful for dealing with values con-
              taining non-character data such as jpegPhoto or audio. A  second
              -t writes all retrieved values to files.

       -T path
              Write  temporary  files to directory specified by path (default:
              /var/tmp/)

       -F prefix
              URL prefix for temporary files.  Default  is  file://path  where
              path is /var/tmp/ or specified with -T.

       -A     Retrieve  attributes  only (no values).  This is useful when you
              just want to see if an attribute is present in an entry and  are
              not interested in the specific values.

       -L     Search  results  are  display  in  LDAP  Data Interchange Format
              detailed in ldif(5).   A  single  -L  restricts  the  output  to
              LDIFv1.
               A second -L disables comments.  A third -L disables printing of
              the LDIF version.  The default is to use an extended version  of
              LDIF.

       -M[M]  Enable manage DSA IT control.  -MM makes control critical.

       -S attribute
              Sort the entries returned based on attribute. The default is not
              to sort entries returned.  If attribute is a zero-length  string
              (""),  the entries are sorted by the components of their Distin-
              guished Name.  See ldap_sort(3)  for  more  details.  Note  that
              ldapsearch  normally prints out entries as it receives them. The
              use of the -S option defeats this behavior, causing all  entries
              to be retrieved, then sorted, then printed.

       -d debuglevel
              Set  the LDAP debugging level to debuglevel.  ldapsearch must be
              compiled with LDAP_DEBUG defined for this  option  to  have  any
              effect.

       -f file
              Read a series of lines from file, performing one LDAP search for
              each line.  In this case, the filter given on the  command  line
              is  treated  as a pattern where the first and only occurrence of
              %s is replaced with a line from file.  Any other  occurrence  of
              the the % character in the pattern will be regarded as an error.
              Where it is desired that the search filter include a  %  charac-
              ter,  the character should be encoded as \25 (see RFC 4515).  If
              file is a single - character, then the lines are read from stan-
              dard  input.  ldapsearch will exit when the first non-successful
              search result is returned, unless -c is used.

       -x     Use simple authentication instead of SASL.

       -D binddn
              Use the Distinguished Name binddn to bind to the LDAP directory.
              For SASL binds, the server is expected to ignore this value.

       -W     Prompt for simple authentication.  This is used instead of spec-
              ifying the password on the command line.

       -w passwd
              Use passwd as the password for simple authentication.

       -y passwdfile
              Use complete contents of passwdfile as the password  for  simple
              authentication.

       -H ldapuri
              Specify  URI(s)  referring to the ldap server(s); a list of URI,
              separated by whitespace or commas is expected; only  the  proto-
              col/host/port  fields  are  allowed.   As  an  exception,  if no
              host/port is specified, but a DN is, the DN is used to  look  up
              the  corresponding  host(s) using the DNS SRV records, according
              to RFC 2782.  The DN must be a non-empty sequence of AVAs  whose
              attribute  type  is "dc" (domain component), and must be escaped
              according to RFC 2396.

       -h ldaphost
              Specify an alternate host on which the ldap server  is  running.
              Deprecated in favor of -H.

       -p ldapport
              Specify  an  alternate TCP port where the ldap server is listen-
              ing.  Deprecated in favor of -H.

       -b searchbase
              Use searchbase as the starting point for the search  instead  of
              the default.

       -s {base|one|sub|children}
              Specify  the scope of the search to be one of base, one, sub, or
              children to specify a base object, one-level, subtree, or  chil-
              dren search.  The default is sub.  Note: children scope requires
              LDAPv3 subordinate feature extension.

       -a {never|always|search|find}
              Specify how aliases dereferencing is done.   Should  be  one  of
              never, always, search, or find to specify that aliases are never
              dereferenced, always dereferenced, dereferenced when  searching,
              or  dereferenced  only  when  locating  the  base object for the
              search.  The default is to never dereference aliases.

       -P {2|3}
              Specify the LDAP protocol version to use.

       -e [!]ext[=extparam]

       -E [!]ext[=extparam]

              Specify general extensions with -e and  search  extensions  with
              -E.  '!' indicates criticality.

              General extensions:
                [!]assert=<filter>   (an RFC 4515 Filter)
                [!]authzid=<authzid> ("dn:<dn>" or "u:<user>")
                [!]manageDSAit
                [!]noop
                ppolicy
                [!]postread[=<attrs>]        (a comma-separated attribute list)
                [!]preread[=<attrs>] (a comma-separated attribute list)
                abandon, cancel (SIGINT sends abandon/cancel; not really controls)

              Search extensions:
                [!]domainScope                       (domain scope)
                [!]mv=<filter>                       (matched values filter)
                [!]pr=<size>[/prompt|noprompt]       (paged results/prompt)
                [!]sss=[-]<attr[:OID]>[/[-]<attr[:OID]>...]  (server side sorting)
                [!]subentries[=true|false]           (subentries)
                [!]sync=ro[/<cookie>]                (LDAP Sync refreshOnly)
                        rp[/<cookie>][/<slimit>]     (LDAP Sync refreshAndPersist)
                [!]vlv=<before>/<after>(/<offset>/<count>|:<value>)  (virtual list view)

       -l timelimit
              wait  at  most  timelimit  seconds  for a search to complete.  A
              timelimit of 0 (zero) or none means no limit.   A  timelimit  of
              max  means  the  maximum  integer  allowable by the protocol.  A
              server may impose a maximal timelimit which only the  root  user
              may override.

       -z sizelimit
              retrieve at most sizelimit entries for a search.  A sizelimit of
              0 (zero) or none means no limit.  A sizelimit of max  means  the
              maximum  integer allowable by the protocol.  A server may impose
              a maximal sizelimit which only the root user may override.

       -O security-properties
              Specify SASL security properties.

       -I     Enable SASL Interactive mode.  Always  prompt.   Default  is  to
              prompt only as needed.

       -Q     Enable SASL Quiet mode.  Never prompt.

       -U authcid
              Specify  the authentication ID for SASL bind. The form of the ID
              depends on the actual SASL mechanism used.

       -R realm
              Specify the realm of authentication ID for SASL bind.  The  form
              of the realm depends on the actual SASL mechanism used.

       -X authzid
              Specify  the  requested authorization ID for SASL bind.  authzid
              must be one of the following formats: dn:<distinguished name> or
              u:<username>

       -Y mech
              Specify  the  SASL  mechanism  to be used for authentication. If
              it's not specified, the program will choose the  best  mechanism
              the server knows.

       -Z[Z]  Issue StartTLS (Transport Layer Security) extended operation. If
              you use -ZZ, the command will require the operation to  be  suc-
              cessful.

OUTPUT FORMAT
       If  one  or  more  entries are found, each entry is written to standard
       output in LDAP Data Interchange Format or ldif(5):

           version: 1

           # bjensen, example, net
           dn: uid=bjensen,dc=example,dc=net
           objectClass: person
           objectClass: dcObject
           uid: bjensen
           cn: Barbara Jensen
           sn: Jensen
           ...

       If the -t option is used, the URI of a temporary file is used in  place
       of  the  actual value.  If the -A option is given, only the "attribute-
       name" part is written.

EXAMPLE
       The following command:

           ldapsearch -LLL "(sn=smith)" cn sn telephoneNumber

       will perform a subtree search (using the default search base and  other
       parameters  defined in ldap.conf(5)) for entries with a surname (sn) of
       smith.  The common name (cn), surname (sn) and  telephoneNumber  values
       will  be  retrieved  and  printed to standard output.  The output might
       look something like this if two entries are found:

           dn: uid=jts,dc=example,dc=com
           cn: John Smith
           cn: John T. Smith
           sn: Smith
           sn;lang-en: Smith
           sn;lang-de: Schmidt
           telephoneNumber: 1 555 123-4567

           dn: uid=sss,dc=example,dc=com
           cn: Steve Smith
           cn: Steve S. Smith
           sn: Smith
           sn;lang-en: Smith
           sn;lang-de: Schmidt
           telephoneNumber: 1 555 765-4321

       The command:

           ldapsearch -LLL -u -t "(uid=xyz)" jpegPhoto audio

       will perform a subtree search using the default search base for entries
       with  user  id of "xyz".  The user friendly form of the entry's DN will
       be output after the line that contains the DN itself, and the jpegPhoto
       and audio values will be retrieved and written to temporary files.  The
       output might look like this if one entry with one value for each of the
       requested attributes is found:

           dn: uid=xyz,dc=example,dc=com
           ufn: xyz, example, com
           audio:< file:///tmp/ldapsearch-audio-a19924
           jpegPhoto:< file:///tmp/ldapsearch-jpegPhoto-a19924

       This command:

           ldapsearch -LLL -s one -b "c=US" "(o=University*)" o description

       will perform a one-level search at the c=US level for all entries whose
       organization name (o) begins begins with University.  The  organization
       name  and description attribute values will be retrieved and printed to
       standard output, resulting in output similar to this:

           dn: o=University of Alaska Fairbanks,c=US
           o: University of Alaska Fairbanks
           description: Preparing Alaska for a brave new yesterday
           description: leaf node only

           dn: o=University of Colorado at Boulder,c=US
           o: University of Colorado at Boulder
           description: No personnel information
           description: Institution of education and research

           dn: o=University of Colorado at Denver,c=US
           o: University of Colorado at Denver
           o: UCD
           o: CU/Denver
           o: CU-Denver
           description: Institute for Higher Learning and Research

           dn: o=University of Florida,c=US
           o: University of Florida
           o: UFl
           description: Warper of young minds

           ...

DIAGNOSTICS
       Exit status is zero if no errors occur.  Errors result  in  a  non-zero
       exit status and a diagnostic message being written to standard error.
