DESCRIPTION
       This  program lets you manage Intelligent Platform Management Interface
       (IPMI) functions of either  the  local  system,  via  a  kernel  device
       driver,  or a remote system, using IPMI V1.5 and IPMI v2.0. These func-
       tions include printing FRU information, LAN configuration, sensor read-
       ings, and remote chassis power control.

       IPMI  management of a local system interface requires a compatible IPMI
       kernel driver to be installed and configured.  On Linux this driver  is
       called  OpenIPMI  and  it  is  included  in standard distributions.  On
       Solaris this driver is called BMC and is inclued in Solaris  10.   Man-
       agement  of a remote station requires the IPMI-over-LAN interface to be
       enabled and configured.  Depending on the  particular  requirements  of
       each  system it may be possible to enable the LAN interface using ipmi-
       tool over the system interface.

OPTIONS
       -a     Prompt for the remote server password.

       -A <authtype>
              Specify an authentication type to use during IPMIv1.5  lan  ses-
              sion  activation.  Supported types are NONE, PASSWORD, MD2, MD5,
              or OEM.

       -c     Present output in CSV (comma separated variable)  format.   This
              is not available with all commands.

       -e <sol_escape_char>
              Use  supplied  character  for SOL session escape character.  The
              default is to use ~ but this can conflict with ssh sessions.

       -k <key>
              Use supplied Kg key for IPMIv2 authentication.  The  default  is
              not to use any Kg key.

       -C <ciphersuite>
              The  remote  server  authentication,  integrity,  and encryption
              algorithms to use for IPMIv2  lanplus  connections.   See  table
              22-19 in the IPMIv2 specification.  The default is 3 which spec-
              ifies RAKP-HMAC-SHA1 authentication, HMAC-SHA1-96 integrity, and
              AES-CBC-128 encryption algorightms.

       -E     The remote server password is specified by the environment vari-
              able IPMI_PASSWORD.

       -f <password_file>
              Specifies a file containing the remote server password. If  this
              option  is  absent,  or  if password_file is empty, the password
              will default to NULL.

       -h     Get basic usage help from the command line.

       -H <address>
              Remote server address, can be  IP  address  or  hostname.   This
              option is required for lan and lanplus interfaces.

       -I <interface>
              Selects  IPMI  interface  to use.  Supported interfaces that are
              compiled in are visible in the usage help output.

       -L <privlvl>
              Force session privilege level.  Can be CALLBACK, USER, OPERATOR,
              ADMINISTRATOR. Default is ADMINISTRATOR.

       -m <local_address>
              Set  the  local  IPMB  address.   The  default is 0x20 and there
              should be no need to change it for normal operation.

       -o <oemtype>
              Select OEM type to support.  This usually involves  minor  hacks
              in  place in the code to work around quirks in various BMCs from
              various manufacturers.  Use -o list to see  a  list  of  current
              supported OEM types.

       -O <sel oem>
              Open  selected  file  and  read OEM SEL event descriptions to be
              used during SEL listings.  See examples in contrib dir for  file
              format.

       -p <port>
              Remote server UDP port to connect to.  Default is 623.

       -P <password>
              Remote  server  password  is  specified on the command line.  If
              supported it will be obscured in the process list.  Note! Speci-
              fying  the password as a command line option is not recommended.

       -S <sdr_cache_file>
              Use local file for remote SDR cache.  Using a  local  SDR  cache
              can  drastically  increase performance for commands that require
              knowledge of the entire SDR to perform  their  function.   Local
              SDR  cache from a remote system can be created with the sdr dump
              command.

       -t <target_address>
              Bridge IPMI requests to the remote target address.

       -U <username>
              Remote server username, default is NULL user.

       -v     Increase verbose output level.  This  option  may  be  specified
              multiple  times to increase the level of debug output.  If given
              three times you will get hexdumps of all incoming  and  outgoing
              packets.

       -V     Display version information.


       If  no  password method is specified then ipmitool will prompt the user
       for a password. If no password is entered at  the  prompt,  the  remote
       server password will default to NULL.

SECURITY
       There  are several security issues be be considered before enabling the
       IPMI LAN interface. A remote station has the ability to control a  sys-
       tem's  power  state  as  well  as being able to gather certain platform
       information. To reduce vulnerability it is strongly  advised  that  the
       IPMI LAN interface only be enabled in 'trusted' environments where sys-
       tem security is not an issue or where there is a dedicated secure 'man-
       agement network'.

       Further  it  is  strongly  advised  that you should not enable IPMI for
       remote access without setting a password, and that that password should
       not be the same as any other password on that system.

       When  an IPMI password is changed on a remote machine with the IPMIv1.5
       lan interface the new password is sent  across  the  network  as  clear
       text.   This  could be observed and then used to attack the remote sys-
       tem.  It is thus recommended that IPMI password management only be done
       over  IPMIv2.0  lanplus  interface or the system interface on the local
       station.

       For IPMI v1.5, the maximum password length is 16 characters.  Passwords
       longer than 16 characters will be truncated.

       For  IPMI  v2.0,  the  maximum password length is 20 characters; longer
       passwords are truncated.

                            ond.  No action should occur if chassis  power  is
                            in  S4/S5  state,  but  it is recommended to check
                            power state first and only  issue  a  power  cycle
                            command  if  the   system  power is on or in lower
                            sleep state than S4/S5.

                     reset

                            This command will perform a hard reset.

                     diag

                            Pulse a diagnostic interrupt (NMI) directly to the
                            processor(s).

                     soft

                            Initiate a soft-shutdown of OS via ACPI.  This can
                            be done in a number of ways, commonly by  simulat-
                            ing  an  overtemperture  or  by simulating a power
                            button press.  It is necessary  for  there  to  be
                            Operating System support for ACPI and some sort of
                            daemon watching for events for this soft power  to
                            work.

              bootdev <device> [<clear-cmos=yes|no>]

                     Request  the system to boot from an alternate boot device
                     on next reboot.  The clear-cmos option, if supplied, will
                     instruct the BIOS to clear its CMOS on the next reboot.

                     Currently supported values for <device> are:

       event

              <predefined event number>

                     Send a pre-defined event to the System  Event  Log.   The
                     following  events  are  included  as  a means to test the
                     functionality of the System Event Log  component  of  the
                     BMC (an entry will be added each time the event n command
                     is executed).

                     Currently supported values for n are:
                     1    Temperature: Upper Critical: Going High
                     2    Voltage Threshold: Lower Critical: Going Low
                     3    Memory: Correctable ECC Error Detected

                     NOTE: These pre-defined events will  likely  not  produce
                     "accurate"  SEL  records  for a particular system because
                     they will not be correctly tied to a valid sensor number,
                     but  they  are  sufficient to verify correct operation of
                     the SEL.


              file <filename>

                     Event log records specified in filename will be added  to
                     the System Event Log.

                     The format of each line in the file is as follows:

                     <{EvM   Revision}   {Sensor  Type}  {Sensor  Num}  {Event
                     Dir/Type} {Event Data 0} {Event Data 1} {Event Data 2}>[#
                     COMMENT]

                     Note:  The Event Dir/Type field is encoded with the event
                     direction as the high bit (bit 7) and the event  type  as
                     the low 7 bits.

                     e.g.:
                     0x4  0x2 0x60 0x1 0x52 0x0 0x0 # Voltage threshold: Lower
                     Critical: Going Low


              <sensorid> <state> [<eventdir>]

                     Generate a custom event based on existing sensor informa-
                     tion.   The optional event direction can be either assert
                     or deassert and defaults to assert.  To  get  a  list  of
                     possible  states  for  a sensor supply a state of list on
                     the command line.  Each sensor may be different but  some
                     states will have pre-defined shortcuts.  For example:

                     > ipmitool -I open event p0.t_core
                     Finding sensor p0.t_core... ok
                     Sensor States:
                       lnr : Lower Non-Recoverable
                       lcr : Lower Critical
                       lnc : Lower Non-Critical
                       unc : Upper Non-Critical
                       ucr : Upper Critical
                       unr : Upper Non-Recoverable

                     > ipmitool -I open event ps0.prsnt
                     Finding sensor ps0.prsnt... ok
                     Sensor States:
                       Device Absent
                       Device Present
                     State State Shortcuts:
                       present    absent
                       assert     deassert
                       limit      nolimit
                       fail       nofail
                       yes        no
                       on         off
                       up         down


       exec <filename>

              Execute  ipmitool  commands  from filename.  Each line is a com-
              plete command.  The syntax of the commands are  defined  by  the
              COMMANDS  section  in  this  manpage.   Each  line  may  have an
              optional comment at the end of the line, delimited  with  a  `#'
              symbol.

              e.g., a command file with two lines:

              sdr list # get a list of sdr records
              sel list # get a list of sel records

       fru

              print

                     This command will read all Field  Replaceable  Unit (FRU)
                     inventory data and extract  such  information  as  serial
                     number,  part  number,  asset  tags,  and  short  strings
                     describing the chassis, board, or product.

       i2c <i2caddr> <read bytes> [<write data>]

              This will allow you to execute raw I2C commands with the  Master
              Write-Read IPMI command.


       isol

              setup <baud rate>

                     Setup baud rate for Intel IPMI v1.5 Serial-over-LAN.

       lan

              These  commands  will  allow  you to configure IPMI LAN channels
              with network information so they can be used with  the  ipmitool
              lan and lanplus interfaces.  NOTE: To determine on which channel
              the LAN interface is located, issue the  `channel  info  number'
              command  until  you  come across a valid 802.3 LAN channel.  For
              example:

              > ipmitool -I open channel info 1
              Channel 0x1 info:
                Channel Medium Type   : 802.3 LAN
                Channel Protocol Type : IPMB-1.0
                Session Support       : session-based
                Active Session Count  : 8
                Protocol Vendor ID    : 7154


              print <channel>

                     Print the  current  configuration  for  the  given  chan-
                     nel.

              set <channel> <parameter>

                     Set the given  parameter  on  the  given  channel.  Valid
                     parameters are:

                     vlan id <off|id>

                            Disable VLAN operation or enable VLAN and set  the
                            ID.
                            ID:  value of the virtual lan identifier between 1
                            and 4094 inclusive.

                     vlan priority <priority>

                            ID: priority of the virtual lan frames  between  0
                            and 7 inclusive.

                     auth <level,...> <type,...>

                            Set  the  valid   authtypes   for   a  given  auth
                            level.
                            Levels: callback, user, operator, admin
                            Types: none, md2, md5, password, oem

                     cipher_privs <privlist>

                            Correlates cipher suite numbers with  the  maximum
                            privilege  level  that  is  allowed to use it.  In
                            this way, cipher suites can  restricted  to  users
                            with  a  given privilege level, so that, for exam-
                            ple, administrators are required to use a stronger
                            cipher suite than normal users.

                            The  format of privlist is as follows.  Each char-
                            acter represents a privilege level and the charac-
                            ter  position  identifies the cipher suite number.
                            For example, the first character represents cipher
                            suite  1  (cipher suite 0 is reserved), the second
                            represents cipher suite 2, and  so  on.   privlist
                            must be 15 characters in length.

                            Characters  used  in privlist and their associated
                            privilege levels are:

                            X    Cipher Suite Unused
                            c    CALLBACK
                            u    USER
                            o    OPERATOR
                            a    ADMIN
                            O    OEM

                            So, to set the maximum privilege for cipher  suite
                            1  to USER and suite 2 to ADMIN, issue the follow-
                            ing command:

                            >  ipmitool   -I   interface   lan   set   channel
                            cipher_privs uaXXXXXXXXXXXXX


       pef

              info

                     This  command  will  query  the BMC and print information
                     about the PEF supported features.

              status

                     This command prints the current PEF status (the last  SEL
                     entry processed by the BMC, etc).

              policy

                     This  command  lists  the PEF policy table entries.  Each
                     policy entry describes an alert  destination.   A  policy
                     set  is a collection of table entries.  PEF alert actions
                     reference policy sets.

              list

                     This command lists the PEF table entries.  Each PEF entry
                     relates a sensor event to an action.  When PEF is active,
                     each platform event causes the BMC to scan this table for
                     entries  matching  the  event, and possible actions to be
                     taken.  Actions are performed in priority  order  (higher
                     criticality first).

       raw <netfn> <cmd> [<data>]

              This  will allow you to execute raw IPMI commands.   For example
              to query the POH counter with a raw command:

              > ipmitool -v raw 0x0 0xf
              RAW REQ (netfn=0x0 cmd=0xf data_len=0)
              RAW RSP (5 bytes)
              3c 72 0c 00 00

       sdr

              get <id> ... [<id>]

                     Prints information for sensor data records  specified  by
                     sensor id.

              info

                     This command will query the BMC for SDR information.

              type <sensor type>

                     This  command  will display all records from the SDR of a
                     specific type.  Run with type list to  see  the  list  of
                     available  types.   For example to query for all Tempera-
                     ture sensors:

                     > ipmitool sdr type Temperature
                     Baseboard Temp   | 30h | ok  |  7.1 | 28 degrees C
                     FntPnl Amb Temp  | 32h | ok  | 12.1 | 24 degrees C
                     Processor1 Temp  | 98h | ok  |  3.1 | 57 degrees C
                     Processor2 Temp  | 99h | ok  |  3.2 | 53 degrees C


              list | elist [<all|full|compact|event|mcloc|fru|generic>]

                     This command will read the Sensor Data Records (SDR)  and
                     extract  sensor  information of a given type,  then query
                     each sensor and print its name, reading, and status.   If
                     invoked  as  elist then it will also print sensor number,
                     entity id and instance, and asserted discrete states.

                     The default output will only  display  full  and  compact
                     sensor  types,  to  see all sensors use the all type with
                     this command.

                     Valid types are:

                            all

                                   All SDR records (Sensor and Locator)

                                   Generic SDR records

              entity <id>[.<instance>]

                     Displays all sensors associated with an  entity.   Get  a
                     list  of valid entity ids on the target system by issuing
                     the sdr elist command.  A list of all entity ids  can  be
                     found in the IPMI specifications.

              dump <file>

                     Dumps raw SDR data to a file.  This data file can then be
                     used as a local SDR cache of the  remote  managed  system
                     with  the  -S <file> option on the ipmitool command line.
                     This can greatly improve performance over  system  inter-
                     face or remote LAN.

       sel

              NOTE:  SEL entry-times are displayed as `Pre-Init Time-stamp' if
              the SEL clock needs to be set.  Ensure that  the  SEL  clock  is
              accurate  by  invoking  the  sel time get and sel time set <time
              string> commands.

              info

                     This command will query the BMC for information about the
                     System Event Log (SEL) and its contents.

              clear

                     This  command  will  clear the contents of  the  SEL.  It
                     cannot be undone so be careful.

              list | elist

                     When this  command  is  invoked  without  arguments,  the
                     entire  contents  of  the System Event Log are displayed.
                     If invoked as elist it will  also  use  the  Sensor  Data
                     Record  entries  to  display the sensor ID for the sensor
                     that caused each event.  Note this can take a  long  time
                     over the system interface.


                     <count>|first <count>

                            Displays the first count (least-recent) entries in
                            the SEL.  If count is zero, all entries  are  dis-
                            played.

                     last <count>

                            Displays  the  last count (most-recent) entries in
                            the SEL.  If count is zero, all entries  are  dis-
                            played.

              delete <number>

                     Delete a single event.

              save <file>

                     Save  SEL  records to text file that can be fed back into
                     the event file ipmitool command.  This can be useful  for
                     testing Event generation by building an appropriate Plat-
                     form Event Message file based on existing events.  Please
                     see  the help for that command to view the format of this
                     file.

              writeraw <file>

                     Save SEL records to a file in raw, binary  format.   This
                     file  can be fed back to the sel readraw ipmitool command
                     for viewing.

              readraw <file>

                     Read and display SEL records from a binary file.  Such  a
                     file  can be created using the sel writeraw ipmitool com-
                     mand.

              time

                     get
                            Displays the SEL clock's current time.

                     set <time string>

                            Sets the SEL clock.  Future SEL entries  will  use
                            the time set by this command.  <time string> is of
                            the form "MM/DD/YYYY HH:MM:SS".  Note  that  hours
                            are  in  24-hour form.  It is recommended that the
                            SEL be cleared before setting the time.

       sensor

              list

                     Lists sensors and thresholds in a wide table format.

              get <id> ... [<id>]

                     Prints information for sensors specified by name.

              thresh <id> <threshold> <setting>

                     This allows you to set  a  particular  sensor   threshold
                     value.  The sensor is specified by name.

                     Valid thresholds are:
                            unr  Upper Non-Recoverable
                            ucr  Upper Critical
                            unc  Upper Non-Critical
                            lnc  Lower Non-Critical
                            lcr  Lower Critical
                            lnr  Lower Non-Recoverable

              thresh <id> lower <lnr> <lcr> <lnc>

                     This  allows you to set all lower thresholds for a sensor
                     at the same time.  The sensor is specified  by  name  and
                     the  thresholds are listed in order of Lower Non-Recover-
                     able, Lower Critical, and Lower Non-Critical.

              thresh <id> upper <unc> <ucr> <unr>

                     This allows you to set all upper thresholds for a  sensor
                     at  the  same  time.  The sensor is specified by name and
                     the thresholds are listed in order of Upper Non-Critical,
                     Upper Critical, and Upper Non-Recoverable.


       session

              info <active|all|id 0xnnnnnnnn|handle 0xnn>

                     Get  information about the specified session(s).  You may
                     identify sessions by their id, by their handle number, by
                     their  active  status,  or  by using the keyword `all' to
                     specify all sessions.

       shell
              This command will launch an interactive shell which you can  use
              to  send  multiple  ipmitool  commands  to  a  BMC  and  see the
              responses.  This can be useful instead of running the full ipmi-
              tool command each time.  Some commands will make use of a Sensor
              Data Record cache and you will see marked improvement  in  speed
              if  these  commands  are able to reuse the same cache in a shell
              session.  LAN sessions will send a periodic keepalive command to
              keep the IPMI session from timing out.

       sol

              info [<channel number>]

                     Retrieve information about the Serial-Over-LAN configura-
                     tion on the specified channel.  If no channel  is  given,
                     it  will display SOL configuration data for the currently
                     used channel.

              set <parameter> <value> [<channel>]

                     Configure parameters for Serial Over Lan.  If no  channel
                     is  given, it will display SOL configuration data for the
                     currently used channel.  Configuration parameter  updates
                     are   automatically  guarded  with  the  updates  to  the
                     set-in-progress parameter.

                     Valid parameters and values are:

                     set-in-progress
                            set-complete set-in-progress commit-write

                            true false

                     force-authentication
                            true false

                     privilege-level
                            user operator admin oem

                     character-accumulate-level
                            Decimal number given in 5 milliseconds increments

                     character-send-threshold
                            Decimal number

                     retry-count
                            Decimal number.   0  indicates  no  retries  after
                            packet is transmitted.

                     retry-interval
                            Decimal  number  in  10  millisend  increments.  0
                            indicates that retries  should  be  sent  back  to
                            back.

                     non-volatile-bit-rate
                            serial,  19.2,  38.4,  57.6,  115.2.  Setting this
                            value to serial indicates that the BMC should  use
                            the  setting used by the IPMI over serial channel.

                     volatile-bit-rate
                            serial, 19.2, 38.4,  57.6,  115.2.   Setting  this
                            value  to  serial indiates that the BMC should use
                            the setting used by the IPMI over serial  channel.

              activate

                     Causes  ipmitool  to  enter  Serial Over LAN mode, and is
                     only available when  using  the  lanplus  interface.   An
                     RMCP+  connection is made to the BMC, the terminal is set
                     to raw mode, and user input is sent to the serial console
                     on  the  remote server.  On exit,the the SOL payload mode
                     is deactivated and the terminal is reset to its  original
                     settings.

                     Special  escape sequences are provided to control the SOL
                     session:

                            ~.   Terminate connection

                            ~^Z  Suspend ipmitool

                            ~B   Send break

                            ~~   Send the escape character by typing it twice

                            ~?   Print the supported escape sequences

              deactivate

                     Deactivates Serial Over LAN mode  on  the  BMC.   Exiting
                     Serial Over LAN mode should automatically cause this com-
                     mand to be sent to the BMC, but in the case of  an  unin-
                     tentional  exit from SOL mode, this command may be neces-
                     sary to reset the state of the BMC.

       sunoem

              led

                     These commands provide a way to get and set the status of
                     LEDs  on  a  Sun  Microsystems  server.   Use  'sdr  list
                     generic' to get a list of devices that  are  controllable
                     LEDs.   The  ledtype parameter is optional and not neces-
                     sary to provide on the command line unless it is required
                     by hardware.

                     get <sensorid> [<ledtype>]

                            Get  status  of  a  particular  LED described by a
                            Generic Device Locator record in the SDR.  A  sen-
                            sorid  of all will get the status of all available
                            LEDS.

                     set <sensorid> <ledmode> [<ledtype>]

                            Set status of a  particular  LED  described  by  a
                            Generic  Device Locator record in the SDR.  A sen-
                            sorid of all will set the status of all  available
                            LEDS to the specified ledmode and ledtype.

                     LED Mode is required for set operations:
                            OFF         Off

                     set <userid> <keyfile>

                            This  command will allow you to specify an SSH key
                            to use for a particular user on the  Service  Pro-
                            cessor.   This  key will be used for CLI logins to
                            the SP and not for IPMI sessions.  View  available
                            users  and their userids with the 'user list' com-
                            mand.

                     del <userid>

                            This command will delete the SSH key for a  speci-
                            fied userid.



       tsol

              This  command  allows Serial-over-LAN sessions to be established
              with Tyan IPMIv1.5 SMDC such as the M3289 or M3290.  The default
              command run with no arguments will establish default SOL session
              back to local IP address.  Optional arguments may be supplied in
              any order.


              <ipaddr>

                     Send  receiver  IP  address  to SMDC which it will use to
                     send serial traffic to.   By  default  this  detects  the
                     local IP address and establishes two-way session.


              port=NUM

                     Configure  UDP  port  to  receive  serial traffic on.  By
                     default this is 6230.


              ro|rw

                     Confiure SOL session as read-only  or  read-write.   Ses-
                     sions are read-write by default.



       user

              summary

                     Displays a summary of userid information, including maxi-
                     mum number of userids, the number of enabled  users,  and
                     the number of fixed names defined.

              list

                     Displays  a  list  of  user  information  for all defined
                     userids.

              set

                     name <userid> <username>

                            Sets  the  username  associated  with  the   given
                            userid.

                     password <userid> [<password>]

                            Sets  the  password  for  the given userid.  If no
                            password is given, the password is cleared (set to
                            the  NULL  password).   Be  careful  when removing
                            passwords from administrator-level accounts.

              disable <userid>

                     Disables access to the BMC by the given userid.

              enable <userid>

                     Enables access to the BMC by the given userid.

              test <userid> <16|20> [<password>]

                     Determine whether a password has been stored as 16 or  20
                     bytes.


OPEN INTERFACE
       The ipmitool open interface utilizes the OpenIPMI kernel device driver.
       This driver is present in all modern 2.4 and all  2.6  kernels  and  it
       should be present in recent Linux distribution kernels.  There are also
       IPMI driver kernel patches for different kernel versions available from
       the OpenIPMI homepage.

       The  required kernel modules is different for 2.4 and 2.6 kernels.  The
       following kernel modules must be loaded on a 2.4-based kernel in  order
       for ipmitool to work:

       ipmi_msghandler
              Incoming and outgoing message handler for IPMI interfaces.

       ipmi_kcs_drv
              An  IPMI Keyboard Controler Style (KCS) interface driver for the
              message handler.

       ipmi_devintf
              Linux character device interface for the message handler.

       The following kernel modules must be loaded on a  2.6-based  kernel  in
       order for ipmitool to work:

       ipmi_msghandler
              Incoming and outgoing message handler for IPMI interfaces.

       ipmi_si
              An  IPMI  system interface driver for the message handler.  This
              module supports various IPMI system interfaces such as KCS,  BT,
              SMIC, and even SMBus in 2.6 kernels.

       ipmi_devintf
              Linux character device interface for the message handler.

       Once  the required modules are loaded there will be a dynamic character
       device entry that must exist at /dev/ipmi0.  For systems that use devfs
       or udev this will appear at /dev/ipmi/0.

       To  create the device node first determine what dynamic major number it
       was assigned by the kernel by looking in /proc/devices and checking for
       the ipmidev entry.  Usually if this is the first dynamic device it will
       be major number 254 and the minor number for the first system interface
       is 0 so you would create the device entry with:

       mknod /dev/ipmi0 c 254 0

       ipmitool  includes  some sample initialization scripts that can perform
       this task automatically at start-up.

       In order to have ipmitool use the OpenIPMI  device  interface  you  can
       specifiy it on the command line:

       ipmitool -I open <command>

BMC INTERFACE
       The  ipmitool  bmc interface utilizes the bmc device driver as provided
       by Solaris 10 and higher.  In order to force ipmitool to  make  use  of
       this interface you can specify it on the command line:

       ipmitool -I bmc <command>

       The following files are associated with the bmc driver:


       /platform/i86pc/kernel/drv/bmc
              32-bit ELF kernel module for the bmc driver.

       /platform/i86pc/kernel/drv/amd64/bmc
              64-bit ELF kernel module for the bmc driver.

       /dev/bmc
              Character device node used to communicate with the bmc driver.

LIPMI INTERFACE
       The  ipmitool  lipmi  interface  uses  the Solaris 9 IPMI kernel device
       driver.  It has been superceeded by the bmc interface  on  Solaris  10.
       You  can  tell  ipmitool  to use this interface by specifying it on the
       command line.

       ipmitool -I lipmi <expression>

LAN INTERFACE
       The ipmitool lan interface communicates with the BMC over  an  Ethernet
       LAN  connection  using  UDP under IPv4.  UDP datagrams are formatted to
       contain IPMI request/response messages with a IPMI session headers  and
       RMCP headers.

       IPMI-over-LAN  uses version 1 of the Remote Management Control Protocol
       (RMCP)  to  support  pre-OS  and  OS-absent  management.   RMCP  is   a
       request-response protocol delivered using UDP datagrams to port 623.

       The  LAN  interface is an authenticatiod multi-session connection; mes-
       sages delivered to the BMC can (and should)  be  authenticated  with  a
       challenge/response  protocol  with  either straight password/key or MD5
       message-digest algorithm.  ipmitool will attempt to connect with admin-
       istrator  privilege  level as this is required to perform chassis power
       functions.

       You can tell ipmitool to use the lan interface with the -I lan option:


       ipmitool -I lan -H <hostname> [-U <username>] [-P <password>] <command>

       A  hostname  must  be given on the command line in order to use the lan
       interface with ipmitool.  The password field is optional; if you do not
       provide  a  password on the command line, ipmitool will attempt to con-
       nect without authentication.  If you specify a password it will use MD5
       authentication if supported by the BMC and straight password/key other-
       wise, unless overridden with a command line option.

LANPLUS INTERFACE
       Like the lan interface, the lanplus interface communicates with the BMC
       over  an  Ethernet LAN connection using UDP under IPv4.  The difference
       is that the lanplus interface uses the RMCP+ protocol as  described  in
       the  IMPI v2.0 specification.  RMCP+ allows for improved authentication
       and data integrity checks, as well as encryption  and  the  ability  to
       carry  multiple  types  of  payloads.   Generic Serial Over LAN support
       requires RMCP+, so the ipmitool sol activate command requires  the  use
       of the lanplus interface.

       RMCP+  session establishment uses a symmetric challenge-response proto-
       col called RAKP  (Remote  Authenticated  Key-Exchange  Protocol)  which
       allows  the  negotiation  of many options.  ipmitool does not yet allow
       the user to specify the value of every option, defaulting to  the  most
       obvious settings marked as required in the v2.0 specification.  Authen-
       tication and integrity HMACS are produced with SHA1, and encryption  is
       performed with AES-CBC-128.  Role-level logins are not yet supported.

       ipmitool  must  be  linked with the OpenSSL library in order to perform
       the encryption functions and support the  lanplus  interface.   If  the
       required  packages  are  not  found it will not be compiled in and sup-
       ported.

       You can tell ipmitool to use the lanplus interface with the -I  lanplus
       option:


       ipmitool -I lanplus -H <hostname> [-U <username>] [-P <password>] <com-
       mand>

       A hostname must be given on the command line in order to  use  the  lan
       interface  with  ipmitool.  With the exception of the -A and -C options
       the rest of the command line options are identical to  those  available
       for the lan interface.

       The  -C  option  allows  you specify the authentication, integrity, and
       encryption algorithms to use for  for  lanplus  session  based  on  the
       cipher  suite  ID  found  in the IPMIv2.0 specification in table 22-19.
       The default cipher suite is 3 which specifies RAKP-HMAC-SHA1  authenti-
       cation, HMAC-SHA1-96 integrity, and AES-CBC-128 encryption algorightms.
