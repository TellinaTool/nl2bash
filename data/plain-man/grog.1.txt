NAME
       grog - guess options for groff command

SYNOPSIS
       grog [ -option ... ] [ files ... ]

DESCRIPTION
       grog  reads  files  and guesses which of the groff(1) options -e, -man,
       -me, -mm, -mom, -ms, -mdoc, -mdoc-old, -p, -R, -g, -G, -s, and  -t  are
       required  for  printing  files,  and prints the groff command including
       those options on the standard output.  A filename  of  -  is  taken  to
       refer  to  the  standard input.  If no files are specified the standard
       input will be read.  Any specified options  will  be  included  in  the
       printed  command.   No space is allowed between options and their argu-
       ments.  The only options recognized are -C (which is also passed on) to
       enable compatibility mode, and -v to print the version number.

       For example,

              `grog -Tdvi paper.ms`

       will  guess  the  appropriate command to print paper.ms and then run it
       after adding the -Tdvi option.
