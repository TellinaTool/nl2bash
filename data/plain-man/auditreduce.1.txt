NAME
     auditreduce -- select records from audit trail files

SYNOPSIS
     auditreduce [-A] [-a YYYYMMDD[HH[MM[SS]]]] [-b YYYYMMDD[HH[MM[SS]]]]
                 [-c flags] [-d YYYYMMDD] [-e euid] [-f egid] [-g rgid]
                 [-j id] [-m event] [-o object=value] [-r ruid] [-u auid] [-v]
                 [file ...]

DESCRIPTION
     The auditreduce utility selects records from the audit trail files based
     on the specified criteria.  Matching audit records are printed to the
     standard output in their raw binary form.  If no file argument is speci-
     fied, the standard input is used by default.  Use the praudit(1) utility
     to print the selected audit records in human-readable form.

     The options are as follows:

     -A      Select all records.

     -a YYYYMMDD[HH[MM[SS]]]
             Select records that occurred after or on the given datetime.

     -b YYYYMMDD[HH[MM[SS]]]
             Select records that occurred before the given datetime.

     -c flags
             Select records matching the given audit classes specified as a
             comma separated list of audit flags.  See audit_control(5) for a
             description of audit flags.

     -d YYYYMMDD
             Select records that occurred on a given date.  This option cannot
             be used with -a or -b.

     -e euid
             Select records with the given effective user ID or name.

     -f egid
             Select records with the given effective group ID or name.

     -g rgid
             Select records with the given real group ID or name.

     -j id   Select records having a subject token with matching ID.

     -m event
             Select records with the given event name or number. This option
             can be used more then once to select records of multiple event
             types.  See audit_event(5) for a description of audit event names
             and numbers.

     -o object=value

             file    Select records containing path tokens, where the pathname
                     matches one of the comma delimited extended regular
                     expression contained in given specification.  Regular
                     expressions which are prefixed with a tilde (`~') are
                     excluded from the search results.  These extended regular
                     expressions are processed from left to right, and a path
                     will either be selected or deslected based on the first
                     match.

                     Since commas are used to delimit the regular expressions,
                     a backslash (`\') character should be used to escape the
                     comma if it is a part of the search pattern.

             msgqid  Select records containing the given message queue ID.

             pid     Select records containing the given process ID.

             semid   Select records containing the given semaphore ID.

             shmid   Select records containing the given shared memory ID.

     -r ruid
             Select records with the given real user ID or name.

     -u auid
             Select records with the given audit ID.

     -v      Invert sense of matching, to select records that do not match.

EXAMPLES
     To select all records associated with effective user ID root from the
     audit log /var/audit/20031016184719.20031017122634:

           auditreduce -e root \
               /var/audit/20031016184719.20031017122634

     To select all setlogin(2) events from that log:

           auditreduce -m AUE_SETLOGIN \
               /var/audit/20031016184719.20031017122634

     Output from the above command lines will typically be piped to a new
     trail file, or via standard output to the praudit(1) command.

     Select all records containing a path token where the pathname contains
     /etc/master.passwd:

           auditreduce -o file="/etc/master.passwd" \
               /var/audit/20031016184719.20031017122634

     Select all records containing path tokens, where the pathname is a TTY
     device:

           auditreduce -o file="/dev/tty[a-zA-Z][0-9]+" \
               /var/audit/20031016184719.20031017122634

     Select all records containing path tokens, where the pathname is a TTY
     except for /dev/ttyp2:

           auditreduce -o file="~/dev/ttyp2,/dev/tty[a-zA-Z][0-9]+" \
               /var/audit/20031016184719.20031017122634
