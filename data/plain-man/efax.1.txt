EFAX(1)                                                                EFAX(1)



NAME
       efax - send/receive faxes with Class 1, 2 or 2.0 fax modem

                        (Please read the fax man page first.)

SYNOPSIS
       efax [ options ] [ -t num [ file... ] ]


OPTIONS
       Where options are:


       -a cmd   use  the  command ATcmd when answering the phone.  The default
                is "A".


       -c caps  set the local modem capabilities.  See the section on capabil-
                ities  below  for the format and meaning of caps.  For Class 1
                the default is 1,n,0,2,0,0,0,0 where n is  the  highest  speed
                supported by the modem.  For Class 2 the default is determined
                by the modem.


       -d dev   use the fax modem connected to device  dev.   The  default  is
                /dev/modem.


       -f fnt   use font file fnt for generating the header.  The default is a
                built-in 8x16 font.  See the efix(1) -f option  for  the  font
                file format.


       -g cmd   if  a  CONNECT  (or  DATA) response indicates a data call, the
                shell /bin/sh is exec(2)'ed with cmd as its command.  cmd is a
                printf(3) format that may contain up to 6 %d escapes which are
                replaced by the baud rate following the  most  recent  CONNECT
                message. cmd typically exec's getty(8).


       -h hdr   put  string  `hdr'  at  the top of each page.  The first %d in
                `hdr' is replaced by the page number and the second,  if  any,
                is replaced by the number of pages being sent.


       -i str

       -j str

       -k str   send the command ATstr to the modem to initialize it.  -i com-
                mands are sent before the modem is put into fax mode, -j  com-
                mands  after  the  modem  is in fax mode, and -k commands just
                before efax exits.  The only default is a hang-up  (ATH)  com-
                mand  that  is sent before exiting only if no other -k options
                are given.  Multiple options may be used.


       -l id    set the local identification string to id.  id should  be  the
                local  telephone  number  in international format (for example
                "+1 800 555-1212").  This is passed to the remote fax machine.
                Some  fax  machines  may not accept characters other than num-
                bers, space, and '+'.


       -o opt   use option opt to accommodate a non-standard fax modem  proto-
                col.   See  the  MODEM  REQUIREMENTS  section  below  for more
                details.  The options are:


           0    Force use of Class 2.0 fax modem  commands.   The  modem  must
                support Class 2.0.


           2    Force  use of Class 2 fax modem commands.  The modem must sup-
                port Class 2.


           1    Force use of Class 1 fax modem commands. The modem  must  sup-
                port  Class 1.  By default efax queries the modem and uses the
                first of the three above classes which  is  supported  by  the
                modem.


           a    use  software adaptive answer method.  If the first attempt to
                answer the call does not result in a data connection within  8
                seconds the phone is hung up temporarily and answered again in
                fax mode (see "Accepting both fax and data calls" below).


           e    ignore errors in modem initialization commands.


           f    use "virtual flow control".  efax tries to estimate the number
                of  bytes  in the modem's transmit buffer and pauses as neces-
                sary to avoid filling it.  The modem's buffer  is  assumed  to
                hold  at  least 96 bytes.  This feature does not work properly
                with Class 2 modems that add redundant padding to scan  lines.
                Use  this  option  only  if you have problems configuring flow
                control.


           h    use hardware (RTS/CTS) in addition to software (XON/XOFF) flow
                control.   Many  modems will stop responding if this option is
                used.  See the section `Resolving Problems' before using  this
                option.


           l    halve  the  time  between  testing lock files when waiting for
                other programs to complete.  By default this is 8 seconds. For
                example -olll sets the interval to 1 second.


           n    ignore requests for pages to be retransmitted. Use this option
                if you don't care about the quality of the received fax or  if
                the  receiving  machine is too fussy.  Otherwise each page may
                be retransmitted up to 3 times.


           r    do not reverse bit order during data  reception  for  Class  2
                modems.   Only  Multitech modems require this option. Not nor-
                mally required since efax detects these modems.


           x    send XON  (DC1)  instead  of  DC2  to  start  data  reception.
                Applies to a very few Class 2 modems only.


           z    delay  an  additional  100 milliseconds before each modem ini-
                tialization or reset command.  The initial delay  is  100  ms.
                For  example,  -ozzz produces a 400 ms delay.  Use with modems
                that get confused when commands arrive too quickly.



       -q n     ask for retransmission of pages  received  with  more  than  n
                errors.  Default is 10.


       -r pat   each received fax page is stored in a separate file.  The file
                name is created using pat as a strftime(3) format  string.   A
                page  number  of  the form .001, .002, ...  is appended to the
                file name.  If pat is blank ("") or no -r option  is  given  a
                default string of "%m%d%H%M%S" is used.



       -s       remove lock file(s) after initializing the modem.  This allows
                outgoing calls to proceed when efax is waiting for an incoming
                call.   If  efax detects modem activity it will attempt to re-
                lock the device.  If the modem has been locked  by  the  other
                program  efax  will  exit and return 1 (``busy'').  Normally a
                new efax process is then started by launchd(8). The  new  efax
                process  will then check periodically until the lock file dis-
                appears and then re-initialize the modem.


       -t num [file...]
                dial telephone  number  num  and  send  the  fax  image  files
                file....   If used, this must be the last argument on the com-
                mand line.  The telephone number num is a string that may con-
                tain  any  dial  modifiers that the modem supports such as a T
                prefix for tone dialing or commas  for  delays.   If  no  file
                names  are  given the remote fax machine will be polled. If no
                -t argument is given efax will answer the phone and attempt to
                receive a fax.


       -v strng select  types of messages to be printed.  Each lower-case let-
                ter in strng enables one type of message:

                   e - errors
                   w - warnings
                   i - session progress information
                   n - capability negotiation information
                   c - modem (AT) commands and responses
                   h - HDLC frame data (Class 1 only)
                   m - modem output
                   a - program arguments
                   r - reception error details
                   t - transmission details
                   f - image file details
                   x - lock file processing

                Up to two -v options may be used.  The first is  for  messages
                printed  to  the standard error and the second is for messages
                to the standard output. The default is "ewin" to the  standard
                error only.


       -w       wait  for an OK or CONNECT prompt instead of issuing an answer
                (ATA) command to receive a fax.   Use  this  option  when  the
                modem is set to auto-answer (using S0=n) or if another program
                has already answered the call.


       -x lkf   use a UUCP-style lock file lkf to lock the modem device before
                opening  it.   If  the  device is locked, efax checks every 15
                seconds until it is free.  Up to 16 -x options may be used  if
                there  are several names for the same device.  A `#' prefix on
                the file name creates an binary rather than  text  (HDB-style)
                lock  file.   This is the reverse of what was used by previous
                efax versions.


FAX FILE FORMATS
       efax can read the same types of files as efix(1)  including  text,  T.4
       (Group  3),  PBM,  single-  and  multi-page TIFF (G3 and uncompressed).
       efax automatically determines the type of file from its contents.  TIFF
       files  are recommended as they contain information about the image size
       and resolution.

       Each page to be sent should be converted to a separate TIFF format file
       with  Group 3 (G3) compression.  Received files are also stored in this
       format.  The EXAMPLES section below shows how efix and  other  programs
       can be used to create, view and print these files.


OPERATING SYSTEM REQUIREMENTS
       The  operating system must provide short response times to avoid proto-
       col timeouts.  For Class 2 and 2.0 modems the delay should not exceed 1
       or 2 seconds.

       When  using  Class  1 modems the program must respond to certain events
       within 55 milliseconds.  Longer delays may cause the  fax  protocol  to
       fail  in  certain  places (between DCS and TCF or between RTC and MPS).
       Class 1 modems should therefore not be  used  on  systems  that  cannot
       guarantee  that  the program will respond to incoming data in less than
       55 milliseconds.  In particular, some intelligent serial cards and ter-
       minal servers may introduce enough delay to cause problems with Class 1
       operation.

       The operating system must also provide sufficient  low-level  buffering
       to  allow  uninterrupted  transfer of data between the modem and a disk
       file at the selected baud rate, typically 9600 bps.  Since the fax pro-
       tocol  does  not  provide  end-to-end flow control the effectiveness of
       flow control while receiving is limited by  the  size  of  the  modem's
       buffer.  This  can be less than 100 bytes.  Efax does not use flow con-
       trol during reception.


MODEM REQUIREMENTS
       The "Group" is the protocol used to send faxes  between  fax  machines.
       Efax  supports the Group 3 protocol used over the public telephone net-
       work.

       The "Class" is the protocol used by computers to  control  fax  modems.
       Efax supports Class 1, 2 and 2.0 fax modems.

       Most  fax modems use XON/XOFF flow control when in fax mode.  This type
       of flow control adds very little overhead for fax use. Many modems have
       unreliable  hardware  (RTS/CTS)  flow  control in fax mode.  By default
       efax enables only XON/XOFF flow control and the -oh option must be used
       to add hardware flow control.

       While  some modems have serial buffers of about 1k bytes, many inexpen-
       sive modems have buffers of about one hundred bytes and are  thus  more
       likely to suffer overruns when sending faxes.

       A  few  older modems may need a delay between commands of more than the
       default value used by efax (100 milliseconds).  If  the  delay  is  too
       short, commands may not echo properly, may time out, or may give incon-
       sistent responses.  Use one or more -oz options to increase  the  delay
       between  modem initialization commands and use the E0 modem initializa-
       tion command to disable echoing of modem commands.

       By default efax sends DC2 to start the data flow from  the  modem  when
       receiving  faxes  from  Class 2 modems.  A few older modems require XON
       instead.  Use of DC2 would cause the modem to  give  an  error  message
       and/or  the program to time out.  The -ox option should be used in this
       case.

       A few older Class 2 modems (e.g. some Intel models) don't send  DC2  or
       XON  to  start  the  data  flow to the modem when sending faxes.  After
       waiting 2 seconds efax will print a warning and start sending  anyways.

       A  very few Class 2 modems do not reverse the bit order (MSB to LSB) by
       default on receive.  This might cause errors when trying to display  or
       print the received files.  The -or option can be used in this case.

       Some  inexpensive  "9600  bps" fax modems only transmit at 9600 bps and
       reception is limited to 4800 bps.

MODEM INITIALIZATION OPTIONS
       The required modem  initialization  commands  are  generated  by  efax.
       Additional  commands  may  be  supplied as command-line arguments.  The
       modem must be set up to issue verbose(text) result codes.  The  follow-
       ing  command  does this and is sent by efax before trying to initialize
       the modem.


       Q0V1     respond to commands with verbose result codes


       The following commands may be useful for special purposes:


       X3       don't wait for dial tone before dialing.  This may be used  to
                send a fax when the call has already been dialed manually.  In
                this case use an empty string ("") as the  first  argument  to
                the  -t  command.  Use X4 (usual default) to enable all result
                codes.


       M2       leave the monitor speaker turned on for the  duration  of  the
                call (use M0 to leave it off).


       L0       turn monitor speaker volume to minimum (use L3 for maximum).


       E0       disable echoing of modem commands.  See the Resolving Problems
                section below.


       &D2      returns the modem to command mode when DTR  is  dropped.   The
                program drops DTR at the start and end of the call if it can't
                get a response to a modem command.  You can use &D3  to  reset
                the modem when DTR is dropped.


       S7=120   wait up to two minutes (120 seconds) for carrier.  This may be
                useful if the answering fax machine takes a long time to start
                the  handshaking  operation  (e.g.  a  combined  fax/answering
                machine with a long announcement).


CAPABILITIES
       The capabilities of the local hardware and software can be set using  a
       string of 8 digits separated by commas:

       vr,br,wd,ln,df,ec,bf,st

       where:


       vr  (vertical resolution) =
                0 for 98 lines per inch
                1 for 196 lpi


       br  (bit rate) =
                0 for 2400 bps
                1 for 4800
                2 for 7200
                3 for 9600
                4 for 12000 (V.17)
                5 for 14400 (V.17)


       wd  (width) =
                0 for 8.5" (21.5 cm) page width
                1 for 10" (25.5 cm)
                2 for 12" (30.3 cm)


       ln  (length) =
                0 for 11" (A4: 29.7 cm) page length
                1 for 14" (B4: 36.4 cm)
                2 for unlimited page length


       df  (data format) =
                0 for 1-D coding
                1 for 2-D coding (not supported)


       ec  (error correction) =
                0 for no error correction


       bf  (binary file) =
                0 for no binary file transfer


       st  (minimum scan time) =
                0 for zero delay per line
                1 for 5 ms per line
                3 for 10 ms per line
                5 for 20 ms per line
                7 for 40 ms per line



       When receiving a fax the vr, wd, and ln fields of the capability string
       should be set to the maximum values that  your  display  software  sup-
       ports.  The default is 196 lpi, standard (8.5"/21.5cm) width and unlim-
       ited length.

       When sending a fax efax will determine vr and ln from  the  image  file
       and set wd to the default.

       If  the  receiving  fax machine does not support high resolution (vr=1)
       mode, efax will reduce the resolution by combining pairs of scan lines.
       If  the  receiving  fax machine does not support the image's width then
       efax will truncate or pad as required. Most fax machines can receive ln
       up to 2.  Few machines support values of wd other than 0.



HEADERS
       efax  adds  blank  scan lines at the top of each image when it is sent.
       This allows room for the page header but increases the  length  of  the
       image (by default about 0.1" or 2.5mm of blank space is added).

       The  header  placed  in this area typically includes the date and time,
       identifies the, and shows the page number  and  total  pages.   Headers
       cannot be disabled but the header string can be set to a blank line.

       The  default font for generating the headers is the built-in 8x16 pixel
       font scaled to 12x24 pixels (about 9 point size).

       Note that both efax and efix have -f options to specify the font.  efIx
       uses the font to generate text when doing text-to-fax conversions (dur-
       ing "fax make") while efAx uses the font to generate the header (during
       "fax send").


SESSION LOG
       A  session log is written to the standard error stream.  This log gives
       status and error messages from  the  program  as  selected  by  the  -v
       option.  A time stamp showing the full time or just minutes and seconds
       is printed  before  each  message.   Times  printed  along  with  modem
       responses also show milliseconds.


RETURN VALUES
       The program returns an error code as follows:


       0        The fax was successfully sent or received.


       1        The  dialed  number  was  busy or the modem device was in use.
                Try again later.


       2        Something failed (e.g. file not found  or  disk  full).  Don't
                retry.  Check the session log for more details.


       3        Modem  protocol  error.   The  program  did  not  receive  the
                expected response from the modem.  The modem may not have been
                properly initialized, the correct -o options were not used, or
                a bug report may be in order.  Check the session log for  more
                details.


       4        The  modem is not responding.  Operator attention is required.
                Check that the modem is turned on and connected to the correct
                port.


       5        The program was terminated by a signal.


       6        The  program  was terminated due to a system power event (i.e.
                the computer is about to sleep).


       7        The operator canceled the call.


EXAMPLES
       Creating fax (G3) files

       The efix program can be used to convert text files to  TIFF-G3  format.
       For example, the following command will convert the text file letter to
       the files letter.001, letter.002, etc,:


              efix -nletter.%03d letter


       Ghostscript's tiffg3 driver can generate fax files  in  TIFF-G3  format
       from postscript files.  For example, the command:


               gs -q -sDEVICE=tiffg3 -dNOPAUSE \
                   -sOutputFile=letter.%03d letter.ps </dev/null


       will  convert the Postscript file letter.ps into high-resolution (vr=1)
       G3 fax image files letter.001, letter.002, ...

       The images should have margins of at least 1/2 inch (1  cm)  since  the
       fax standard only requires that fax machines print a central portion of
       the image 196.6mm (7.7 inches) wide by 281.5mm (11.1 inches) high.

       The efix program can also insert bitmaps in images  to  create  letter-
       head, signatures, etc.

       Printing fax files

       On  CUPS  based systems you can use lpr(1) to print faxes. For example,
       to print the received fax file reply.001 use the command:


              lpr reply.001


       On lpd based systems you can use the efix program  to  print  faxes  on
       Postscript  or  HP-PCL  (LaserJet) printers.  For example, to print the
       received fax file reply.001 on a Postscript printer use the command:


              efix -ops reply.001 | lpr


       Sending fax files

       The following command will dial the number 222-2222 using tone  dialing
       and  send  a  two-page  fax  from the TIFF-G3 files letter.001 and let-
       ter.002 using the fax modem connected to device /dev/cua1.


              efax -d /dev/cua1 \
                   -t T222-2222 letter.001 letter.002


       Manual answer

       You can use efax to answer the phone immediately and start  fax  recep-
       tion.   Use  this  mode  if you need to answer calls manually to see if
       they are fax or voice.

       For example, the following command will make the fax  modem  on  device
       /dev/ttyS1 answer the phone and attempt to receive a fax.  The received
       fax will be stored in the files reply.001, reply.002, and so  on.   The
       modem  will  identify itself as "555-1212" and receive faxes at high or
       low resolution (vr=1), at up to 14.4 kbps (br=5).


              efax -d /dev/ttyS1 -l "555-1212" \
                 -c 1,5 -r reply


       Automatic answer

       The -w option makes efax wait for characters to become  available  from
       the  modem (indicating an incoming call) before starting fax reception.
       Use the -w option and a -iS0=n option  to  answer  the  phone  after  n
       rings.   The example below will make the modem answer incoming calls in
       fax mode on the fourth ring and save the  received  faxes  using  files
       names corresponding to the reception date and time.


              efax -d /dev/ttyb -w -iS0=4 2>&1 >> fax.log


       Sharing the modem with outgoing calls

       The  modem  device  can  be shared by programs that use the UUCP device
       locking protocol.  This includes pppd, chat, minicom,  kermit,  uucico,
       efax,  cu,  and many others others.  However, locking will only work if
       all programs use the same lock file.

       efax will lock the modem device before opening it if one or  more  UUCP
       lock  file  names are given with -x options.  Most programs place their
       lock files in the /usr/spool/uucp or /var/lock directories and use  the
       name  LCK..dev  where  dev  is  the name of the device file in the /dev
       directory that is to be locked.

       If the -s (share) option is used, the lock file is removed while  wait-
       ing for incoming calls so other programs can use the same device.

       If  efax detects another program using the modem while it is waiting to
       receive a fax, efax exits with a termination code of 1.   A  subsequent
       efax  process  using  this  device will wait until the other program is
       finished before re-initializing the modem  and  starting  to  wait  for
       incoming calls again.

       Programs  that  try  to  lock  the modem device by using device locking
       facilities other than UUCP lock files not be able to use this  arbitra-
       tion  mechanism  because  the  device  will  still  be open to the efax
       process.  In this case you will need to kill  the  efax  process  (e.g.
       "fax stop") before starting the other program.

       When  efax is waiting for a fax it leaves the modem ready to receive in
       fax mode but removes the lock file.  When a slip or PPP  program  takes
       over  the  modem  port by setting up its own lock file efax cannot send
       any more commands to the modem -- not even to reset it.  Therefore  the
       other program has to set the modem back to data mode when it starts up.
       To do this add a modem reset command (send ATZ expect OK) to the begin-
       ning of your slip or PPP chat script.

       Accepting both fax and data calls

       Many  modems  have an adaptive data/fax answer mode that can be enabled
       using the -j+FAE=1 (for Class 1) or -jFAA=1 (for Class 2[.0])  initial-
       ization  string.   The  type  of call (data or fax) can then be deduced
       from the modem's responses.

       Some modems have limited adaptive answer features  (e.g.  only  working
       properly  at certain baud rates or only in Class 2) or none at all.  In
       this case use the initialization string -i+FCLASS=0 to answer  in  data
       mode first and the -oa option to then hang up and try again in fax mode
       if the first answer attempt was not successful.  This method only works
       if  your  telephone system waits a few seconds after you hang up before
       disconnecting incoming calls.

       If the -g option is used then the option's argument will be  run  as  a
       shell  command  when an incoming data call is detected.  Typically this
       command will exec getty(8).  This program should  expect  to  find  the
       modem  already off-hook and a lock file present so it should not try to
       hang up the line or create a lock file.  Note that the modem should  be
       set  up  to  report  the  DCE-DTE  (modem-computer, e.g. CONNECT 38400)
       speed, not the DCE-DCE (modem-modem, e.g. CONNECT  14400)  speed.   For
       many modems the initialization option -iW0 will set this.

       The following command will make efax answer incoming calls on /dev/cua1
       on the second ring.  This device will be  locked  using  two  different
       lock  files  but  these  lock  files  will be removed while waiting for
       incoming calls (-s).  If a data call is  detected,  the  getty  program
       will  be  run  to  initialize  the terminal driver and start a login(1)
       process.   Received  fax  files  will  be  stored  using   names   like
       Dec02-12.32.33.001,  in  the  /usr/spool/fax/incoming directory and the
       log file will be appended to /usr/spool/fax/faxlog.cua1.


              efax -d /dev/cua1  -j '+FAA=1' \
                 -x /usr/spool/uucp/LCK..cua1 \
                 -x /usr/spool/uucp/LCK..ttyS1 \
                 -g "exec /sbin/getty -h /dev/cua1 %d" \
                 -iS0=2 -w -s \
                 -r "/usr/spool/fax/incoming/%b%d-%H.%I.%S" \
                 >> /usr/spool/fax/faxlog.cua1 2>&1


       Note that adaptive answer of either type will not work for all callers.
       For some data calls the duration of the initial data-mode answer may be
       too short for data handshaking to complete.  In other cases this  dura-
       tion  may  be so long that incoming fax calls will time out before efax
       switches to fax mode.  In addition, some  calling  fax  modems  mistake
       data-mode  answering  tones  for  fax  signaling tones and initiate fax
       negotiation too soon.  If you use  software  adaptive  answer  you  can
       reduce  the  value  of the initial data-mode answer (set by TO_DATAF in
       efax.c) to get more reliable fax handshaking or increase  it  for  more
       reliable  data  handshaking.   However, if you need to provide reliable
       fax and data service to all callers you should use separate phone  num-
       bers for the two types of calls.

       When  a  call  is answered the modem goes on-line with the computer-to-
       modem baud rate fixed at the speed used for the most recent AT command.
       When efax is waiting for a fax or data call it sets the interface speed
       to 19200 bps since this is the speed required for fax operation.   This
       prevents full use of 28.8kbps modem capabilities.



USING LAUNCHD TO RUN EFAX
       efax  can  answer  all  incoming calls if you create a launchd.plist(5)
       file in /System/Library/LaunchDaemons. The launchd(8) process will  run
       a  new  copy of efax when the system boots up and whenever the previous
       efax process terminates.  The configuration file should invoke efax  by
       running the fax script with an answer argument.

       For example, the following XML Property List keeps efax running contin-
       uously:


                <?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
                <!DOCTYPE plist PUBLIC "-//Apple Computer//DTD PLIST 1.0//EN" "http://www.apple.com/DTDs/PropertyList-1.0.dtd">
                <plist version="1.0">
                <dict>
                     <key>Label</key>
                     <string>com.cce.efax</string>
                     <key>OnDemand</key>
                     <false/>
                     <key>ProgramArguments</key>
                     <array>
                          <string>/usr/bin/fax</string>
                          <string>answer</string>
                     </array>
                </dict>
                </plist>


       You should protect the fax script and configuration files against  tam-
       pering  since launchd will execute them as a privileged (root) process.
       If you will be allowing data calls  via  getty  and  login  you  should
       ensure  that  your system is reasonably secure (e.g. that all user id's
       have secure passwords).

       If efax exec()'s getty properly but you get a garbled login prompt then
       there  is  probably a baud rate mismatch between the modem and the com-
       puter.  First, check the efax log file to make sure the modem's CONNECT
       response  reported  the  serial port speed (e.g. 19200), not the modem-
       modem speed (e.g. 14400).  Next, check the getty options and/or config-
       uration  files  (e.g.  /etc/gettydefs)  for  that particular baud rate.
       Then run getty manually with the same arguments  and  verify  the  port
       settings  using  ``stty </dev/XXX''.  Note that you'll probably want to
       enable hardware flow control  for  data  connections  (-h  for  agetty,
       CRTSCTS for getty_ps).

       A  few programs won't work properly when efax is set up to answer calls
       because they don't create lock files.  You can  put  the  shell  script
       ``wrapper''  below  around  such  programs  to make them work properly.
       Change BIN and LOCKF to suit.


              #!/bin/sh
              BIN=/bin/badprogram
              LOCKF=/var/spool/uucp/LCK..cua1
              if [ -f $LOCKF ]
              then
                      echo lock file $LOCKF exists
                      exit 1
              else
                      printf "%10d0 $$ >$LOCKF
                      $BIN $*
                      rm $LOCKF
              fi




DELIVERING RECEIVED FAXES BY E-MAIL
       The "fax answer" script described above can be configured to e-mail the
       fax  files  received  by the previous fax answer process to a "fax man-
       ager" who can then forward the  fax  to  the  correct  recipient.   The
       received  fax  files  are  send as MIME attachments, one file per page,
       using the ``base64'' text encoding and the ``image/tiff'' file  format.

       To  view  the fax images directly from your e-mail reader you will have
       to configure it with an application that  can  display  files  of  type
       image/tiff.   Typically  this  is specified in a ``mailcap'' file.  For
       example, placing the following line in /etc/mailcap will cause the  fax
       file attachments to be displayed using the ``fax view'' command.

       image/tiff; fax view %s


SENDING FAXES USING THE PRINT SPOOLER
       You  can configure a "fax" printer into the lpr print spooler that will
       fax a document out using efax instead of printing it. To set up  a  fax
       printer do the following:

       lpadmin   -p   fax   -E  -P  /System/Library/Frameworks/ApplicationSer-
       vices.framework/Frameworks/PrintCore.frame-
       work/Resources/English.lproj/Fax.ppd -v fax://dev/cu.modem


       You should now be able to send a fax using the lpr interface by using a
       command such as:


              lpr -P fax -ophone="555-1212" file.ps


       You can use lpq(1) to check the fax queue, lprm(1) to remove  fax  jobs
       and  lpc(8)  to control the spooler.  In each case use the -Pfax option
       to specify the fax ``printer.'' A log file will be mailed to  the  user
       when the fax is sent.

       See the lpr(1) man page for information on the print spooler.


RESOLVING PROBLEMS
       Double  check  the  configuration  setup  in  the first part of the fax
       script, particularly the modem device name and the lock file names.

       If  efax  hangs  when  trying  to  open  the  modem  device  (typically
       /dev/ttyX),  the  device  is  either  already in use by another process
       (e.g. pppd) or it requires the carrier detect line to be true before it
       can  be  opened.   Many systems define an alternate device name for the
       same physical device (typically cuaX) that can be opened even  if  car-
       rier is not present or other programs are already using it.

       If  responses to modem initialization commands are being lost or gener-
       ated at random, another processes (e.g. getty or  an  efax  auto-answer
       process)  may be trying to use the modem at the same time.  Try running
       efax while this other program is running.   If  efax  does  not  report
       "/dev/ttyX locked or busy. waiting."  then the lock files names are not
       specified correctly.

       Attempt to send a fax. Check that the modem starts making  the  calling
       signal  (CNG,  a  0.5 second beep every 3 seconds) as soon as it's fin-
       ished dialing.  This shows the modem is in fax mode.  You may  need  to
       set the SPKR variable to -iM2L3 to monitor the phone line to do this.

       Listen for the answering fax machine and check that it sends the answer
       signal (CED, a 3  second  beep)  followed  by  "warbling"  sounds  (DIS
       frames)  every  3  seconds.   If  you hear a continuous sound (tones or
       noise) instead, then you've connected to a data modem instead.

       Your modem should send back its own warble (DCS frame) in  response  to
       DIS immediately followed by 1.5 seconds of noise (a channel check).  If
       everything is OK, the receiving  end  will  send  another  warble  (CFR
       frame) and your modem will start to send data.  If you have an external
       modem, check its LEDs.  If flow control is working properly the modem's
       send  data  (SD)  LED  will turn off periodically while the fax data is
       sent.

       Check the message showing the line count and the average bit rate  when
       the  page transmission is done.  Low line counts (under 1000 for a let-
       ter size image) or the warning "fax output buffer overflow" while send-
       ing  indicate  that  the image data format is incorrect. Check the file
       being sent using the "fax view" command.

       If you get the error message ``flow control did not  work''  then  flow
       control was not active.  This usually results in a garbled transmission
       and the receiving machine may reject the page, abort the call, print  a
       distorted or blank image and/or hang up.

       The  warning "characters received while sending" or an <XOFF> character
       appearing after  the  transmission  means  that  the  operating  system
       ignored  the  modem's XOFF flow control character.  Ensure that you are
       not running other programs such as getty or pppd at the  same  time  as
       efax since they will turn off xon/xoff flow control.

       If  you  cannot get flow control to work properly then enable ``virtual
       flow control'' with the -of option or hardware flow  control  with  the
       -oh option.

       Check  that  the  remote  machine  confirms  reception  with  a +FPTS:1
       response (Class 2) or an MCF frame (Class 1).

       For Class 2 modems, the error message "abnormal call termination  (code
       nn)" indicates that the modem detected an error and hung up.

       Many  companies  advertise  services  that will fax back information on
       their products.  These can be useful for testing fax reception.

       The message "run length buffer overflow" when  receiving  indicates  an
       error  with  the image data format.  You may need to use the -or option
       with certain Class 2 modems.

       If efax displays the message "can't happen (<details>)" please  send  a
       bug report to the author.

       Finally,  don't  play  "option bingo," if you can't resolve the problem
       send a verbose log of the failed session (the output from fax  -v  ...)
       to the address below.

BUGS
       Can't read TIFF files with more than 1 strip

       Class 1 operation may fail if the program can't respond to certain data
       received from the modem within 55 milliseconds.

       May fail if multitasking delays cause the received data to overflow the
       computer's serial device buffer or if an  under-run  of  transmit  data
       exceeds 5 seconds.

       Polling does not work.

       Does not support 2-D coding, ECM, or BFT.
