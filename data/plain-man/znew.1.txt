ZNEW(1)                   BSD General Commands Manual                  ZNEW(1)

NAME
     znew -- convert compressed files to gzipped files

SYNOPSIS
     znew [-ftv9K] file ...

DESCRIPTION
     The znew utility uncompresses files compressed by compress(1) and recom-
     presses them with gzip(1).

     The options are as follows:

     -f      Overwrite existing `.gz' files.  Unless this option is specified,
             znew refuses to overwrite existing files.

     -t      Test integrity of the gzipped file before deleting the original
             file.  If the integrity check fails, the original `.Z' file is
             not removed.

     -v      Print a report specifying the achieved compression ratios.

     -9      Use the -9 mode of gzip(1), achieving better compression at the
             cost of slower execution.

     -K      Keep the original `.Z' file if it uses less disk blocks than the
             gzipped one.  A disk block is 1024 bytes.

SEE ALSO
     gzip(1)

CAVEATS
     The znew utility tries to maintain the file mode of the original file.
     If the original file is not writable, it is not able to do that and znew
     will print a warning.
