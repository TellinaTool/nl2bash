SUMMARY
       htdbm  is  used  to manipulate the DBM format files used to store user-
       names  and  password  for  basic  authentication  of  HTTP  users   via
       mod_authn_dbm.  See  the  dbmmanage  documentation for more information
       about these DBM files.



OPTIONS
       -b     Use batch mode; i.e., get the password  from  the  command  line
              rather  than  prompting  for it. This option should be used with
              extreme care, since the password is clearly visible on the  com-
              mand line. For script use see the -i option.

       -i     Read  the  password  from stdin without verification (for script
              usage).

       -c     Create the passwdfile.  If  passwdfile  already  exists,  it  is
              rewritten and truncated. This option cannot be combined with the
              -n option.

       -n     Display the results on standard output rather  than  updating  a
              database.  This  option  changes the syntax of the command line,
              since the passwdfile argument (usually the first one)  is  omit-
              ted. It cannot be combined with the -c option.

       -m     Use  MD5  encryption for passwords. On Windows and Netware, this
              is the default.

       -B     Use bcrypt encryption for passwords. This is  currently  consid-
              ered to be very secure.

       -C     This flag is only allowed in combination with -B (bcrypt encryp-
              tion). It sets the computing time used for the bcrypt  algorithm
              (higher  is more secure but slower, default: 5, valid: 4 to 31).

       -d     Use crypt() encryption for passwords. The default on  all  plat-
              forms  but  Windows  and  Netware.  Though possibly supported by
              htdbm on all platforms, it is not supported by the httpd  server
              on  Windows  and  Netware. This algorithm is insecure by today's
              standards.

       -s     Use SHA encryption for passwords. Facilitates migration  from/to
              Netscape  servers  using  the  LDAP Directory Interchange Format
              (ldif). This algorithm is insecure by today's standards.

       -p     Use plaintext passwords. Though htdbm will support  creation  on
              all  platforms,  the  httpd  daemon  will only accept plain text
              passwords on Windows and Netware.

       -l     Print each of the usernames and comments from  the  database  on
              stdout.

       -v     Verify  the username and password. The program will print a mes-
              sage indicating whether the supplied password is valid.  If  the
              password is invalid, the program exits with error code 3.

       -x     Delete  user.  If the username exists in the specified DBM file,
              it will be deleted.

       -t     Interpret the final parameter as a comment. When this option  is
              specified,  an  additional string can be appended to the command
              line; this string will be stored in the "Comment" field  of  the
              database, associated with the specified username.

       filename
              The  filename of the DBM format file. Usually without the exten-
              sion .db, .pag, or .dir. If -c is given, the DBM file is created
              if it does not already exist, or updated if it does exist.

       username
              The username to create or update in passwdfile. If username does
              not exist in this file, an entry is added. If it does exist, the
              password is changed.

       password
              The  plaintext  password  to  be encrypted and stored in the DBM
              file. Used only with the -b flag.

       -TDBTYPE
              Type of DBM file (SDBM, GDBM, DB, or "default").


BUGS
       One should be aware that there are a number of different DBM file  for-
       mats in existence, and with all likelihood, libraries for more than one
       format may exist on your system. The three primary examples  are  SDBM,
       NDBM,  GNU  GDBM,  and  Berkeley/Sleepycat DB 2/3/4. Unfortunately, all
       these libraries use different file formats, and you must make sure that
       the  file format used by filename is the same format that htdbm expects
       to see. htdbm currently has no way of determining what type of DBM file
       it  is looking at. If used against the wrong format, will simply return
       nothing, or may create a different DBM file with a different  name,  or
       at  worst,  it may corrupt the DBM file if you were attempting to write
       to it.


       One can usually use the file program supplied with most Unix systems to
       see what format a DBM file is in.


EXIT STATUS
       htdbm  returns a zero status ("true") if the username and password have
       been successfully added or updated in the DBM File. htdbm returns 1  if
       it  encounters  some  problem  accessing files, 2 if there was a syntax
       problem with the command line, 3 if the password was  entered  interac-
       tively  and the verification entry didn't match, 4 if its operation was
       interrupted, 5 if a value is too long (username, filename, password, or
       final  computed  record), 6 if the username contains illegal characters
       (see the Restrictions section), and 7 if the file is not  a  valid  DBM
       password file.


EXAMPLES
             htdbm /usr/local/etc/apache/.htdbm-users jsmith



       Adds or modifies the password for user jsmith. The user is prompted for
       the password. If executed on a Windows system,  the  password  will  be
       encrypted  using the modified Apache MD5 algorithm; otherwise, the sys-
       tem's crypt() routine will be used. If the file does not  exist,  htdbm
       will do nothing except return an error.


             htdbm -c /home/doe/public_html/.htdbm jane



       Creates a new file and stores a record in it for user jane. The user is
       prompted for the password. If the file exists and cannot  be  read,  or
       cannot  be  written, it is not altered and htdbm will display a message
       and return an error status.


             htdbm -mb /usr/web/.htdbm-all jones Pwd4Steve



       Encrypts the password from the command line (Pwd4Steve) using  the  MD5
       algorithm, and stores it in the specified file.


SECURITY CONSIDERATIONS
       Web  password files such as those managed by htdbm should not be within
       the Web server's URI space -- that is, they  should  not  be  fetchable
       with a browser.


       The  use  of  the  -b  option is discouraged, since when it is used the
       unencrypted password appears on the command line.


       When using the crypt() algorithm, note that only the first 8 characters
       of the password are used to form the password. If the supplied password
       is longer, the extra characters will be silently discarded.


       The SHA encryption format does not use salting: for a  given  password,
       there is only one encrypted representation. The crypt() and MD5 formats
       permute the representation by prepending a random salt string, to  make
       dictionary attacks against the passwords more difficult.


       The SHA and crypt() formats are insecure by today's standards.


RESTRICTIONS
       On  the Windows platform, passwords encrypted with htdbm are limited to
       no more than 255 characters in length. Longer passwords will  be  trun-
       cated to 255 characters.


       The  MD5  algorithm  used  by htdbm is specific to the Apache software;
       passwords encrypted using it will not be usable with other Web servers.


       Usernames are limited to 255 bytes and may not include the character :.
