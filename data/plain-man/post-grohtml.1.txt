DESCRIPTION
       The grohtml front end (which consists of a  preprocessor,  pre-grohtml,
       and  a  device driver, post-grohtml) translates the output of GNU troff
       to html.  Users should always invoke grohtml via the groff command with
       a -Thtml option.  If no files are given, grohtml will read the standard
       input.  A filename of - will also cause grohtml to  read  the  standard
       input.  Html output is written to the standard output.  When grohtml is
       run by groff options can be passed to grohtml using groff's -P  option.

OPTIONS
       -aaa-text-bits
              Number  of  bits  of antialiasing information to be used by text
              when generating png images.  The default is 4 but  valid  values
              are  0,  1,  2, and 4.  Note your version of gs needs to support
              the -dTextAlphaBits and -dGraphicAlphaBits options in  order  to
              exploit  antialiasing.   A value of 0 stops grohtml from issuing
              antialiasing commands to gs.

       -b     Initialize the background color to white.

       -Ddir  Inform grohtml to place all image files into directory dir.

       -Fdir  Prepend directory dir/devname to the search path  for  font  and
              device  description  files; name is the name of the device, usu-
              ally html.

       -gaa-graphic-bits
              Number of bits of antialiasing information to be used by  graph-
              ics when generating png images.  The default is 4 but valid val-
              ues are 0, 1, 2, and 4.  Note your version of gs needs  to  sup-
              port the -dTextAlphaBits and -dGraphicAlphaBits options in order
              to exploit antialiasing.  A value of 0 stops grohtml from  issu-
              ing antialiasing commands to gs.

       -h     Generate  section  and  number  headings by using <B>...</B> and
              increasing the font size, rather  than  using  the  <Hn>...</Hn>
              tags.

       -iresolution
              Select  the  resolution  for all images.  By default this is 100
              pixels per inch.  Example: -i200 indicates 200 pixels per  inch.

       -Istem Determine   the  image  stem  name.   If  omitted  grohtml  uses
              grohtml-XXX (XXX is the process ID).

       -jfilename
              Inform grohtml to split the html  output  into  multiple  files.
              The filename is the stem and specified section headings (default
              is level one) start a new file, named filename-n.html.

       -l     Turn off the production of automatic section links at the top of
              the document.

       -n     Generate  simple heading anchors whenever a section/number head-
              ing is found.  Without the option the anchor value is  the  tex-
              tual heading.  This can cause problems when a heading contains a
              `?' on older versions of some browsers (Netscape).  This flag is
              automatically turned on if a heading contains an image.

       -overtical-offset
              Specify the vertical offset of images in points.

       -p     Display  page  rendering  progress to stderr.  grohtml only dis-
              plays a page number when an image is required.

       -r     Turn off the automatic header and footer line (html rule).

       -s size
              Set the base point size of the  source  file.   Thereafter  when
              this  point size is used in the source it will correspond to the
              html base size.  Every increase of two points in the source will
              yield  a <big> tag, and conversely when a decrease of two points
              is seen a <small> tag is emitted.

       -Slevel
              When splitting html output,  split  at  the  heading  level  (or
              higher) defined by level.

       -v     Print the version number.

USAGE
       There  are  styles  called  R, I, B, and BI mounted at font positions 1
       to 4.

DEPENDENCIES
       grohtml is dependent upon the png utilities (pnmcut, pnmcrop, pnmtopng)
       and  GhostScript (gs).  pnmtopng (version 2.37.6 or greater) and pnmcut
       from the netpbm package (version 9.16 or greater) will work  also.   It
       is  also  dependent upon psselect from the PSUtils package.  Images are
       generated whenever a table, picture, equation or line is encountered.

BUGS
       Grohtml has been completely redesigned and rewritten.  It is still beta
       code.
