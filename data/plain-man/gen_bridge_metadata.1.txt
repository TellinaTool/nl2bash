NAME
     gen_bridge_metadata -- Objective-C Bridges Metadata Generator

SYNOPSIS
     gen_bridge_metadata [options...] headers...

DESCRIPTION
     gen_bridge_metadata is a tool that generates bridging metadata informa-
     tion for a given framework or set of headers. The Objective-C bridges
     supported in Mac OS X, such as MacRuby (Ruby) and PyObjC (Python), read
     this information at runtime.

     As of Mac OS 10.7, gen_bridge_metadata uses an improved parser, based on
     clang.  This means the generated files should be more correct and com-
     plete, and the true parsing allows the automatic extraction of metadata
     from existing __attribute__() information supported by the compiler.
     File generation time should also be faster.

     Metadata files describe the parts of an Objective-C framework that the
     bridges cannot automatically handle. These are primarily the ANSI C ele-
     ments of the framework -- functions, constants, enumerations, and so on
     -- but also include special cases such as functions or methods that
     accept pointer-like arguments. These special cases must be manually spec-
     ified in separate files called exceptions. The gen_bridge_metadata tool
     can then read in the exceptions file when it generates the framework
     metadata.

     The file extension used for metadata files should be .bridgesupport.

     Certain elements, such as inline functions, cannot be described in the
     metadata files. It is therefore required to generate a dynamic library in
     order to make the bridges use them. The gen_bridge_metadata tool can take
     care of that for you.

     The file extension for the dynamic libraries should be .dylib.

     You should install metadata files in one of three filesystem locations.
     For example, for a framework named MyFramework that is installed as
     /Library/Frameworks/MyFramework.framework, you can install the
     MyFramework.bridgesupport and MyFramework.dylib files in one of the fol-
     lowing possible locations, in order of priority:

     o   /Library/Frameworks/MyFramework/Resources/BridgeSupport

     o   /Library/BridgeSupport

     o   ~/Library/BridgeSupport

OPTIONS
     The gen_bridge_metadata tool accepts the following command-line options:

     -f framework, --framework framework
          Generates metadata for the given framework.  This argument can
          accept both the name of a framework of an absolute path to a frame-
          work. When passing a framework name, the program will try to locate
          the framework in one of the standard framework locations.

     -p, --private
          Generates metadata based on the private headers of the given frame-
          works. This argument must be used with the -f argument.

     -F format, --format format
          Selects the metadata format that will be generated. Possible values
          are:

          final                The final metadata format. This is the default
                               value.

          dylib                The dynamic library format. This is only
                               required if you want to support inline func-
                               tions. In order to use this format you need to
                               pass a value for the -o argument.

          exceptions-template  This will generate an exception template.
                               Please consult BridgeSupport(5) for more
                               details about the exception format. Once your
                               exception file is finished you can pass it to
                               the -e argument in order to generate the final
                               metadata.

     -e file, --exception file
          Considers the given exception file when generating the final meta-
          data format. The given exception file must conform to a certain for-
          mat, described in bridgeSupport(5).  Exception files are manually
          written, but you can generate a template by passing -F
          exceptions-template to the generator.

     --64-bit
          (This option is included for backwards compatibility, as this is now
          the default behavior.)  Writes both 32 and 64-bit annotations to the
          final metadata format and compiles the dylib both 32 and 64-bit (if
          a framework is specified and it only contains either 32 or 64-bit
          architectures, then the final metadata format and dylib will be cre-
          ated only for that architecture).  In order to use this option you
          need to run the generator on a 64-bit machine.  The generation will
          take a bit more than twice the time, as both 32 and 64-bit will need
          to be processed and merged into one.

     --no-32-bit
          Do not write the 32-bit annotations to the final metadata format or
          compile the dylib 32-bit.  May not be used with --no-64-bit.

     --no-64-bit
          Do not write the 64-bit annotations to the final metadata format or
          compile the dylib 64-bit.  May not be used with --no-32-bit.

     -c, --cflags flags
          Provides custom flags that will be passed to the C compiler. The
          generator compiles and executes several C and Objective-C programs
          during the generation of the final metadata format. Some flags are
          determined by default, but you might want to provide your own flags
          according to the piece of code you want to generate metadata for
          (for example, a framework part of a umbrella framework).

     -C, --cflags-64 flags
          Provides custom flags that will be passed to the C compiler, when
          generating 64-bit annotations. By default the same flags are passed
          to the C compiler when generating both 32-bit and 64-bit annota-
          tions.

     -o, --output file
          Writes the output to the given file. This argument is mandatory when
          generating the ``dylib'' format. For other formats, by default the
          output is redirected to the standard output.

     -h, --help
          Prints a summary of the options.

     -d, --debug
          Turns on debugging messages. You probably don't want to enable this
          option, unless you are going to debug the metadata generator.

     -v, --version
          Shows the version of the program. The version is also marked in gen-
          erated metadata files, as the ``version'' attribute of the
          ``signatures'' top-level element.

EXAMPLES
     This generates bridge support metadata for a custom framework:
           mkdir -p /Path/To/YourFramework.framework/Resources/BridgeSupport
           gen_bridge_metadata -f /Path/To/YourFramework.framework -o
           /Path/To/YourFramework.framework/Resources/BridgeSupport/YourFramework.bridgesupport

     If the custom framework has inline functions and you want to be able to
     call them, here is how you can generate a ``dylib'' file:
           gen_bridge_metadata -f /Path/To/YourFramework.framework -F dylib -o
           /Path/To/YourFramework.framework/Resources/BridgeSupport/YourFramework.dylib

     It is also possible to generate bridge support metadata for a standalone
     C library (here, libcurl):
           gen_bridge_metadata -c '-lcurl -I/usr/include/curl'
           /usr/include/curl/*.h > /Library/BridgeSupport/curl.bridgesupport
