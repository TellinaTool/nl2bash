NAME
     db_printlog

SYNOPSIS
     db_printlog [-NrV] [-h home] [-P password]

DESCRIPTION
     The db_printlog utility is a debugging utility that dumps Berkeley DB log
     files in a human-readable format.

     The options are as follows:

     -h
        Specify a home directory for the database environment; by default, the
        current working directory is used.

     -N
        Do not acquire shared region mutexes while running. Other problems,
        such as potentially fatal errors in Berkeley DB, will be ignored as
        well. This option is intended only for debugging errors, and should
        not be used under any other circumstances.

     -P
        Specify an environment password. Although Berkeley DB utilities over-
        write password strings as soon as possible, be aware there may be a
        window of vulnerability on systems where unprivileged users can see
        command-line arguments or where utilities are not able to overwrite
        the memory containing the command-line arguments.

     -r
        Read the log files in reverse order.

     -V
        Write the library version number to the standard output, and exit.

     For more information on the db_printlog output and using it to debug
     applications, see Reviewing Berkeley DB log files.

     The db_printlog utility uses a Berkeley DB environment (as described for
     the -h option, the environment variable DB_HOME, or because the utility
     was run in a directory containing a Berkeley DB environment). In order to
     avoid environment corruption when using a Berkeley DB environment,
     db_printlog should always be given the chance to detach from the environ-
     ment and exit gracefully. To cause db_printlog to release all environment
     resources and exit cleanly, send it an interrupt signal (SIGINT).

     The db_printlog utility exits 0 on success, and >0 if an error occurs.

ENVIRONMENT
     DB_HOME  If the -h option is not specified and the environment variable
              DB_HOME is set, it is used as the path of the database home, as
              described in DB_ENV->open.
