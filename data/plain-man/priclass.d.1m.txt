NAME
       priclass.d - priority distribution by scheduling class. Uses DTrace.

SYNOPSIS
       priclass.d

DESCRIPTION
       This  is  a  simple  DTrace  script that samples at 1000 Hz the current
       thread's scheduling class and priority. A distribution plot is printed.

       With  priorities,  the higher the priority the better chance the thread
       has of being scheduled.

       This idea came from the script /usr/demo/dtrace/pri.d,  which  produces
       similar output for priority changes, not samples.

       Since  this  uses  DTrace, only users with root privileges can run this
       command.

EXAMPLES
       This samples until Ctrl-C is hit.
              # priclass.d


FIELDS
       value  process priority

       count  number of samples of at least this priority


SCHEDULING CLASSES

BASED ON
       /usr/demo/dtrace/pri.d
