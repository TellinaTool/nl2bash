SNMPNETSTAT(1)                     Net-SNMP                     SNMPNETSTAT(1)



NAME
       snmpnetstat  -  display networking status and configuration information
       from a network entity via SNMP

SYNOPSIS
       snmpnetstat [COMMON OPTIONS] [-Ca] [-Cn] AGENT
       snmpnetstat [COMMON OPTIONS] [-Ci] [-Co] [-Cr] [-Cn] [-Cs] AGENT
       snmpnetstat [COMMON OPTIONS] [-Ci] [-Cn] [-CI interface] AGENT  [inter-
       val]
       snmpnetstat [COMMON OPTIONS] [-Ca] [-Cn] [-Cs] [-Cp protocol] AGENT

DESCRIPTION
       The  snmpnetstat  command  symbolically  displays the values of various
       network-related information retrieved from a remote  system  using  the
       SNMP  protocol.  There are a number of output formats, depending on the
       options for the information presented.  The first form of  the  command
       displays a list of active sockets.  The second form presents the values
       of other network-related information according to the option  selected.
       Using the third form, with an interval specified, snmpnetstat will con-
       tinuously display the information regarding packet traffic on the  con-
       figured  network interfaces.  The fourth form displays statistics about
       the named protocol.

       snmpnetstat will issue GETBULK requests to query for information if  at
       least protocol version v2 is used.

       AGENT  identifies a target SNMP agent, which is instrumented to monitor
       the given objects.  At its simplest, the AGENT specification will  con-
       sist  of  a hostname or an IPv4 address. In this situation, the command
       will attempt communication with the agent, using UDP/IPv4 to  port  161
       of  the given target host. See snmpcmd(1) for a full list of the possi-
       ble formats for AGENT.


OPTIONS
       The options have the following meaning:

       COMMON OPTIONS
        Please see snmpcmd(1) for a list of possible values for common options
       as well as their descriptions.

       -Ca  With  the default display, show the state of all sockets; normally
       sockets used by server processes are not shown.

       -Ci Show the state of all of the network  interfaces.   The   interface
       display  provides  a  table  of cumulative statistics regarding packets
       transferred, errors, and collisions.  The   network  addresses  of  the
       interface  and  the  maximum  transmission unit (``mtu'') are also dis-
       played.

       -Co Show an abbreviated interface status, giving  octets  in  place  of
       packets.   This  is  useful  when enquiring virtual interfaces (such as
       Frame-Relay circuits) on a router.

       -CI interface Show information only about this interface; used with  an
       interval as described below.

       -Cn  Show network addresses as numbers (normally snmpnetstat interprets
       addresses and attempts to display them symbolically).  This option  may
       be used with any of the display formats.

       -Cp  protocol  Show  statistics about protocol, which is either a well-
       known name for a protocol or an alias for it.  Some protocol names  and
       aliases  are  listed in the file /etc/protocols.  A null response typi-
       cally means that there are no interesting numbers to report.  The  pro-
       gram  will complain if protocol is unknown or if there is no statistics
       routine for it.

       -Cs Show per-protocol statistics.  When used with the -Cr option,  show
       routing statistics instead.

       -Cr Show the routing tables.  When -Cs is also present, show per-proto-
       col routing statistics instead of the routing tables.

       -CR repeaters  For  GETBULK  requests,  repeaters  specifies  the  max-
       repeaters value to use.

       When   snmpnetstat  is invoked with an interval argument, it displays a
       running count of statistics related to  network  interfaces.   interval
       is the number of seconds between reporting of statistics.

       The Active Sockets Display (default)

       The  default  display,  for  active sockets, shows the local and remote
       addresses,  protocol,  and  the  internal  state   of  the    protocol.
       Address    formats    are    of   the   form  ``host.port''  or  ``net-
       work.port'' if  a  socket's  address specifies  a  network  but no spe-
       cific  host  address.   When  known, the host and network addresses are
       displayed symbolically according   to  the  data  bases /etc/hosts  and
       /etc/networks,  respectively.  If a symbolic  name  for  an address  is
       unknown, or if the -Cn option is  specified,  the  address  is  printed
       numerically,  according  to  the  address family.  For more information
       regarding the Internet ``dot format,'' refer   to  inet(3N).   Unspeci-
       fied,  or  ``wildcard'', addresses and ports appear as ``*''.

       The Interface Display

       The   interface   display  provides  a  table  of cumulative statistics
       regarding packets transferred, errors, and col- lisions.   The  network
       addresses  of the interface and the maximum transmission unit (``mtu'')
       are also displayed.

       The Routing Table Display

       The routing table display indicates the  available  routes  and   their
       status.    Each  route  consists of a destination host or network and a
       gateway to use in  forwarding  pack- ets.   The flags field  shows  the
       state  of  the  route  (``U''  if  ``up''), whether the route is  to  a
       gateway  (``G''), whether  the  route  was created dynamically by a re-
       direct (``D''), and whether the route  has  been  modified  by  a redi-
       rect  (``M'').    Direct   routes   are   created  for  each  interface
       attached  to  the  local  host;   the  gateway  field for  such entries
       shows the address of the outgoing inter-  face.   The  interface  entry
       indicates the network interface utilized for the route.

       The Interface Display with an Interval

       When  snmpnetstat  is  invoked with an interval argument, it displays a
       running count of statistics  related  to   network  interfaces.    This
       display   consists   of a column for the primary interface and a column
       summarizing information for all  interfaces.   The  primary   interface
       may  be replaced with another interface with the -CI option.  The first
       line of each screen of information contains a summary since the  system
       was  last rebooted.  Subsequent lines of output show values accumulated
       over the preceding interval.

       The Active Sockets Display for a Single Protocol

       When a protocol is specified with the -Cp option, the information  dis-
       played  is  similar  to that in the default display for active sockets,
       except the display is limited to the given protocol.
