NAME
       rwbytype.d - read/write bytes by vnode type. Uses DTrace.

SYNOPSIS
       rwbytype.d

DESCRIPTION
       This program identifies the vnode type of read/write activity - whether
       that is for regular files, sockets,  character  special  devices,  etc.
       This  is  measuring at the application level, so file activity may well
       be cached by the system.

       Since this uses DTrace, only users with root privileges  can  run  this
       command.

EXAMPLES
       This samples until Ctrl-C is hit.
              # rwbytype.d


FIELDS
       PID    process ID

       CMD    process name

       VNODE  vnode type (describes I/O type)

       DIR    direction, Read or Write

       BYTES  total bytes


DOCUMENTATION
       See  the  DTraceToolkit for further documentation under the Docs direc-
       tory. The DTraceToolkit docs may include full worked examples with ver-
       bose descriptions explaining the output.

EXIT
       rwbytype.d will sample until Ctrl-C is hit.
