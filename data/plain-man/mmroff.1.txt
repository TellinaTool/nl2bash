NAME
       mmroff - reference preprocessor

SYNOPSIS
       mmroff [ -x ] groff_arguments

DESCRIPTION
       mmroff  is  a  simple  preprocessor for groff, it is used for expanding
       references in mm, see groff_mm(7).  groff is executed twice, first with
       -z  and  -rRef=1 to collect all references and then to do the real pro-
       cessing when the reference file is up to date.

       -x     Just create the reference file. This can be used to refresh  the
              reference  file,  it isn't always needed to have accurate refer-
              ences and by using this option groff will only be run once.
