execsnoop(1m)                    USER COMMANDS                   execsnoop(1m)



NAME
       execsnoop - snoop new process execution. Uses DTrace.

SYNOPSIS
       execsnoop [-a|-A|-ejhsvZ] [-c command]

DESCRIPTION
       execsnoop  prints  details  of  new  processes  as  they  are executed.
       Details such as UID, PID and argument listing are printed out.

       This program is very useful to examine short lived processes that would
       not normally appear in a prstat or "ps -ef" listing. Sometimes applica-
       tions will run hundreds  of  short  lived  processes  in  their  normal
       startup cycle, a behaviour that is easily monitored with execsnoop.

       Since  this  uses  DTrace, only users with root privileges can run this
       command.

OPTIONS
       -a     print all data

       -A     dump all data, space delimited

       -e     safe output, parseable. This prevents the ARGS field  containing
              "\n"s, to assist postprocessing.

       -j     print project ID

       -s     print start time, us

       -v     print start time, string

       -Z     print zonename

       -c command
              command name to snoop

EXAMPLES
       Default output, print processes as they are executed,
              # execsnoop

       Print human readable timestamps,
              # execsnoop -v

       Print zonename,
              # execsnoop -Z

       Snoop this command only,
              # execsnoop -c ls


FIELDS
       UID    User ID

       PID    Process ID

       PPID   Parent Process ID

       COMM   command name for the process

       ARGS   argument listing for the process

       ZONE   zonename

       PROJ   project ID

       TIME   timestamp for the exec event, us

       STRTIME
              timestamp for the exec event, string

       bose descriptions explaining the output.
