NAME
       ntpdc - vendor-specific NTP query program

SYNOPSIS
       ntpdc [-flag [value]]... [--opt-name [[=| ]value]]...
               [ host ...]

DESCRIPTION
       This manual page briefly documents the ntpdc command.  The [= prog-name
       =] utility program is used to query an NTP  daemon  about  its  current
       state and to request changes in that state.  It uses NTP mode 7 control
       message formats described in the source code.  The program may  be  run
       either  in interactive mode or controlled using command line arguments.
       Extensive state and statistics information is available through the  [=
       prog-name  =]  interface.   In  addition,  nearly all the configuration
       options which can be specified at startup  using  ntpd's  configuration
       file may also be specified at run time using [= prog-name =] .



OPTIONS
       -4, --ipv4
              Force  IPv4 DNS name resolution.  This option must not appear in
              combination with any of the following options: ipv6.

              Force DNS resolution of following host names on the command line
              to the IPv4 namespace.

       -6, --ipv6
              Force  IPv6 DNS name resolution.  This option must not appear in
              combination with any of the following options: ipv4.

              Force DNS resolution of following host names on the command line
              to the IPv6 namespace.

       -c cmd, --command=cmd
              run  a  command  and  exit.  This option may appear an unlimited
              number of times.

              The following argument is interpreted as an  interactive  format
              command  and  is added to the list of commands to be executed on
              the specified host(s).

       -l, --listpeers
              Print a list of the peers.  This option must not appear in  com-
              bination with any of the following options: command.

              Print  a list of the peers known to the server as well as a sum-
              mary of their state.  This  is  equivalent  to  the  'listpeers'
              interactive command.

       -p, --peers
              Print  a list of the peers.  This option must not appear in com-
              bination with any of the following options: command.

              Print a list of the peers known to the server as well as a  sum-
              mary  of their state. This is equivalent to the 'peers' interac-
              tive command.

       -s, --showpeers
              Show a list of the peers.  This option must not appear in combi-
              nation with any of the following options: command.

              Print  a list of the peers known to the server as well as a sum-
              mary of their state. This is equivalent to the 'dmpeers'  inter-
              active command.

       -i, --interactive
              Force ntpq to operate in interactive mode.  This option must not
              appear in combination with any of the  following  options:  com-
              mand, listpeers, peers, showpeers.

              Force  ntpq  to  operate  in  interactive mode.  Prompts will be
              written to the standard output and commands read from the  stan-
              dard input.

       -d, --debug-level
              Increase  output debug message level.  This option may appear an
              unlimited number of times.

              Increase the debugging message output level.

       -D string, --set-debug-level=string
              Set the output debug message level.  This option may  appear  an
              unlimited number of times.

              Set the output debugging level.  Can be supplied multiple times,
              but each overrides the previous value(s).

       -n, --numeric
              numeric host addresses.

              Output all host addresses in dotted-quad numeric  format  rather
              than converting to the canonical host names.

       -?, --help
              Display extended usage information and exit.

       -!, --more-help
              Extended usage information passed thru pager.

       -> [rcfile], --save-opts[=rcfile]
              Save  the  option state to rcfile.  The default is the last con-
              figuration file listed in the OPTION PRESETS section, below.

       -< rcfile, --load-opts=rcfile, --no-load-opts
              Load options from rcfile.  The no-load-opts  form  will  disable
              the  loading of earlier RC/INI files.  --no-load-opts is handled
              early, out of order.

       - [{v|c|n}], --version[={v|c|n}]
              Output version of program and exit.  The default mode is `v',  a
              simple  version.   The `c' mode will print copyright information
              and `n' will print the full copyright notice.

OPTION PRESETS
       Any option that is not marked as not presettable may be preset by load-
       ing  values from configuration ("RC" or ".INI") file(s) and values from
       environment variables named:
         NTPDC_<option-name> or NTPDC
       The environmental presets take precedence (are  processed  later  than)
       the  configuration  files.   The homerc files are "$HOME", and ".".  If
       any of these are directories, then the  file  .ntprc  is  searched  for
       within those directories.
