NAME
       perl5101delta - what is new for perl v5.10.1

DESCRIPTION
       This document describes differences between the 5.10.0 release and the
       5.10.1 release.

       If you are upgrading from an earlier release such as 5.8.8, first read
       the perl5100delta, which describes differences between 5.8.8 and 5.10.0

Incompatible Changes
   Switch statement changes
       The handling of complex expressions by the "given"/"when" switch
       statement has been enhanced. There are two new cases where "when" now
       interprets its argument as a boolean, instead of an expression to be
       used in a smart match:

       flip-flop operators
           The ".." and "..." flip-flop operators are now evaluated in boolean
           context, following their usual semantics; see "Range Operators" in
           perlop.

           Note that, as in perl 5.10.0, "when (1..10)" will not work to test
           whether a given value is an integer between 1 and 10; you should
           use "when ([1..10])" instead (note the array reference).

           However, contrary to 5.10.0, evaluating the flip-flop operators in
           boolean context ensures it can now be useful in a "when()", notably
           for implementing bistable conditions, like in:

               when (/^=begin/ .. /^=end/) {
                 # do something
               }

       defined-or operator
           A compound expression involving the defined-or operator, as in
           "when (expr1 // expr2)", will be treated as boolean if the first
           expression is boolean. (This just extends the existing rule that
           applies to the regular or operator, as in "when (expr1 || expr2)".)

       The next section details more changes brought to the semantics to the
       smart match operator, that naturally also modify the behaviour of the
       switch statements where smart matching is implicitly used.

   Smart match changes
       Changes to type-based dispatch

       The smart match operator "~~" is no longer commutative. The behaviour
       of a smart match now depends primarily on the type of its right hand
       argument. Moreover, its semantics have been adjusted for greater
       consistency or usefulness in several cases. While the general backwards
       compatibility is maintained, several changes must be noted:

       o   Code references with an empty prototype are no longer treated
           specially.  They are passed an argument like the other code
           references (even if they choose to ignore it).

       o   "%hash ~~ sub {}" and "@array ~~ sub {}" now test that the
           subroutine returns a true value for each key of the hash (or
           element of the array), instead of passing the whole hash or array
           as a reference to the subroutine.

       o   Due to the commutativity breakage, code references are no longer
           treated specially when appearing on the left of the "~~" operator,
           but like any vulgar scalar.

       o   "undef ~~ %hash" is always false (since "undef" can't be a key in a
           hash). No implicit conversion to "" is done (as was the case in
           perl 5.10.0).

       o   "$scalar ~~ @array" now always distributes the smart match across
           the elements of the array. It's true if one element in @array
           verifies "$scalar ~~ $element". This is a generalization of the old
           behaviour that tested whether the array contained the scalar.

       The full dispatch table for the smart match operator is given in "Smart
       matching in detail" in perlsyn.

       Smart match and overloading

       According to the rule of dispatch based on the rightmost argument type,
       when an object overloading "~~" appears on the right side of the
       operator, the overload routine will always be called (with a 3rd
       argument set to a true value, see overload.) However, when the object
       will appear on the left, the overload routine will be called only when
       the rightmost argument is a simple scalar. This way distributivity of
       smart match across arrays is not broken, as well as the other
       behaviours with complex types (coderefs, hashes, regexes). Thus,
       writers of overloading routines for smart match mostly need to worry
       only with comparing against a scalar, and possibly with stringification
       overloading; the other common cases will be automatically handled
       consistently.

       "~~" will now refuse to work on objects that do not overload it (in
       order to avoid relying on the object's underlying structure). (However,
       if the object overloads the stringification or the numification
       operators, and if overload fallback is active, it will be used instead,
       as usual.)

   Other incompatible changes
       o   The semantics of "use feature :5.10*" have changed slightly.  See
           "Modules and Pragmata" for more information.

       o   It is now a run-time error to use the smart match operator "~~"
           with an object that has no overload defined for it. (This way "~~"
           will not break encapsulation by matching against the object's
           internal representation as a reference.)

       o   The version control system used for the development of the perl
           interpreter has been switched from Perforce to git.  This is mainly
           an internal issue that only affects people actively working on the
           perl core; but it may have minor external visibility, for example
           in some of details of the output of "perl -V". See perlrepository
           for more information.

       o   The internal structure of the "ext/" directory in the perl source
           has been reorganised. In general, a module "Foo::Bar" whose source
           was stored under ext/Foo/Bar/ is now located under ext/Foo-Bar/.
           Also, some modules have been moved from lib/ to ext/. This is
           purely a source tarball change, and should make no difference to
           the compilation or installation of perl, unless you have a very
           customised build process that explicitly relies on this structure,
           or which hard-codes the "nonxs_ext" Configure parameter.
           Specifically, this change does not by default alter the location of
           any files in the final installation.

       o   As part of the "Test::Harness" 2.x to 3.x upgrade, the experimental
           "Test::Harness::Straps" module has been removed.  See "Updated
           Modules" for more details.

       o   As part of the "ExtUtils::MakeMaker" upgrade, the
           "ExtUtils::MakeMaker::bytes" and "ExtUtils::MakeMaker::vmsish"
           modules have been removed from this distribution.

       o   "Module::CoreList" no longer contains the %:patchlevel hash.

       o   This one is actually a change introduced in 5.10.0, but it was
           missed from that release's perldelta, so it is mentioned here
           instead.

           A bugfix related to the handling of the "/m" modifier and "qr"
           resulted in a change of behaviour between 5.8.x and 5.10.0:

               # matches in 5.8.x, doesn't match in 5.10.0
               $re = qr/^bar/; "foo\nbar" =~ /$re/m;

Core Enhancements
   Unicode Character Database 5.1.0
       The copy of the Unicode Character Database included in Perl 5.10.1 has
       been updated to 5.1.0 from 5.0.0. See
       <http://www.unicode.org/versions/Unicode5.1.0/#Notable_Changes> for the
       notable changes.

   A proper interface for pluggable Method Resolution Orders
       As of Perl 5.10.1 there is a new interface for plugging and using
       method resolution orders other than the default (linear depth first
       search).  The C3 method resolution order added in 5.10.0 has been re-
       implemented as a plugin, without changing its Perl-space interface. See
       perlmroapi for more information.

   The "overloading" pragma
       This pragma allows you to lexically disable or enable overloading for
       some or all operations. (Yuval Kogman)

   Parallel tests
       The core distribution can now run its regression tests in parallel on
       Unix-like platforms. Instead of running "make test", set "TEST_JOBS" in
       your environment to the number of tests to run in parallel, and run
       "make test_harness". On a Bourne-like shell, this can be done as

           TEST_JOBS=3 make test_harness  # Run 3 tests in parallel

       An environment variable is used, rather than parallel make itself,
       because TAP::Harness needs to be able to schedule individual non-
       conflicting test scripts itself, and there is no standard interface to
       "make" utilities to interact with their job schedulers.

       Note that currently some test scripts may fail when run in parallel
       (most notably "ext/IO/t/io_dir.t"). If necessary run just the failing
       scripts again sequentially and see if the failures go away.

   DTrace support
       Some support for DTrace has been added. See "DTrace support" in
       INSTALL.

   Support for "configure_requires" in CPAN module metadata
       Both "CPAN" and "CPANPLUS" now support the "configure_requires" keyword
       in the "META.yml" metadata file included in most recent CPAN
       distributions.  This allows distribution authors to specify
       configuration prerequisites that must be installed before running
       Makefile.PL or Build.PL.

       See the documentation for "ExtUtils::MakeMaker" or "Module::Build" for
       more on how to specify "configure_requires" when creating a
       distribution for CPAN.

Modules and Pragmata
   New Modules and Pragmata
       "autodie"
           This is a new lexically-scoped alternative for the "Fatal" module.
           The bundled version is 2.06_01. Note that in this release, using a
           string eval when "autodie" is in effect can cause the autodie
           behaviour to leak into the surrounding scope. See "BUGS" in autodie
           for more details.

       "Compress::Raw::Bzip2"
           This has been added to the core (version 2.020).

       "parent"
           This pragma establishes an ISA relationship with base classes at
           compile time. It provides the key feature of "base" without the
           feature creep.

       "Parse::CPAN::Meta"
           This has been added to the core (version 1.39).

   Pragmata Changes
       "attributes"
           Upgraded from version 0.08 to 0.09.

       "attrs"
           Upgraded from version 1.02 to 1.03.

       "base"
           Upgraded from version 2.13 to 2.14. See parent for a replacement.

       "bigint"
           Upgraded from version 0.22 to 0.23.

       "bignum"
           Upgraded from version 0.22 to 0.23.

       "bigrat"
           Upgraded from version 0.22 to 0.23.

       "charnames"
           Upgraded from version 1.06 to 1.07.

           The Unicode NameAliases.txt database file has been added. This has
           the effect of adding some extra "\N" character names that formerly
           wouldn't have been recognised; for example, "\N{LATIN CAPITAL
           LETTER GHA}".

       "constant"
           Upgraded from version 1.13 to 1.17.

       "feature"
           The meaning of the ":5.10" and ":5.10.X" feature bundles has
           changed slightly. The last component, if any (i.e. "X") is simply
           ignored.  This is predicated on the assumption that new features
           will not, in general, be added to maintenance releases. So ":5.10"
           and ":5.10.X" have identical effect. This is a change to the
           behaviour documented for 5.10.0.

       "fields"
           Upgraded from version 2.13 to 2.14 (this was just a version bump;
           there were no functional changes).

       "Test::Harness"
           Upgraded from version 2.64 to 3.17.

           Note that one side-effect of the 2.x to 3.x upgrade is that the
           experimental "Test::Harness::Straps" module (and its supporting
           "Assert", "Iterator", "Point" and "Results" modules) have been
           removed. If you still need this, then they are available in the
           (unmaintained) "Test-Harness-Straps" distribution on CPAN.

           Upgraded from version 1.37 to 1.38.

       "Tie::StdHandle"
           This has documentation changes, and has been assigned a version for
           the first time: version 4.2.

       "Time::HiRes"
           Upgraded from version 1.9711 to 1.9719.

       "Time::Local"
           Upgraded from version 1.18 to 1.1901.

       "Time::Piece"

           "charinfo()" now works on Unified CJK code points added to later
           versions of Unicode.

           "casefold()" has new fields returned to provide both a simpler
           interface and previously missing information. The old fields are
           retained for backwards compatibility. Information about Turkic-
           specific code points is now returned.

           The documentation has been corrected and expanded.

       "UNIVERSAL"
           Upgraded from version 1.04 to 1.05.

       "Win32"
           Upgraded from version 0.34 to 0.39.

       "Win32API::File"

       "XSLoader"
           Upgraded from version 0.08 to 0.10.

Utility Changes
       h2ph
           Now looks in "include-fixed" too, which is a recent addition to
           gcc's search path.

       h2xs
           No longer incorrectly treats enum values like macros (Daniel Burr).

           Now handles C++ style constants ("//") properly in enums. (A patch
           from Rainer Weikusat was used; Daniel Burr also proposed a similar
           fix).

       perl5db.pl
           "LVALUE" subroutines now work under the debugger.

           The debugger now correctly handles proxy constant subroutines, and
           subroutine stubs.

       perlthanks
           Perl 5.10.1 adds a new utility perlthanks, which is a variant of
           perlbug, but for sending non-bug-reports to the authors and
           maintainers of Perl. Getting nothing but bug reports can become a
           bit demoralising: we'll see if this changes things.

New Documentation
       perlhaiku
           This contains instructions on how to build perl for the Haiku
           platform.

       perlmroapi
           This describes the new interface for pluggable Method Resolution
           Orders.

       perlperf
           This document, by Richard Foley, provides an introduction to the
           use of performance and optimization techniques which can be used
           with particular reference to perl programs.

       perlrepository
           This describes how to access the perl source using the git version
           control system.

       perlthanks
           This describes the new perlthanks utility.

Changes to Existing Documentation
       The various large "Changes*" files (which listed every change made to
       perl over the last 18 years) have been removed, and replaced by a small
       file, also called "Changes", which just explains how that same
       information may be extracted from the git version control system.

       The file Porting/patching.pod has been deleted, as it mainly described
       interacting with the old Perforce-based repository, which is now
       obsolete.  Information still relevant has been moved to perlrepository.

       perlapi, perlintern, perlmodlib and perltoc are now all generated at
       build time, rather than being shipped as part of the release.

Performance Enhancements
       o   A new internal cache means that "isa()" will often be faster.

       o   Under "use locale", the locale-relevant information is now cached
           on read-only values, such as the list returned by "keys %hash".
           This makes operations such as "sort keys %hash" in the scope of
           "use locale" much faster.

       o   Empty "DESTROY" methods are no longer called.

Installation and Configuration Improvements
   ext/ reorganisation
       The layout of directories in ext has been revised. Specifically, all
       extensions are now flat, and at the top level, with "/" in pathnames
       replaced by "-", so that ext/Data/Dumper/ is now ext/Data-Dumper/, etc.
       The names of the extensions as specified to Configure, and as reported
       by %Config::Config under the keys "dynamic_ext", "known_extensions",
       "nonxs_ext" and "static_ext" have not changed, and still use "/". Hence
       this change will not have any affect once perl is installed. However,
       "Attribute::Handlers", "Safe" and "mro" have now become extensions in
       their own right, so if you run Configure with options to specify an
       exact list of extensions to build, you will need to change it to
       account for this.

       For 5.10.2, it is planned that many dual-life modules will have been
       moved from lib to ext; again this will have no effect on an installed
       perl, but will matter if you invoke Configure with a pre-canned list of
       extensions to build.

   Configuration improvements
       If "vendorlib" and "vendorarch" are the same, then they are only added
       to @INC once.

       $Config{usedevel} and the C-level "PERL_USE_DEVEL" are now defined if
       perl is built with  "-Dusedevel".

       Configure will enable use of "-fstack-protector", to provide protection
       against stack-smashing attacks, if the compiler supports it.

       Configure will now determine the correct prototypes for re-entrant
       functions, and for "gconvert", if you are using a C++ compiler rather
       than a C compiler.

       On Unix, if you build from a tree containing a git repository, the
       configuration process will note the commit hash you have checked out,
       for display in the output of "perl -v" and "perl -V". Unpushed local
       commits are automatically added to the list of local patches displayed
       by "perl -V".

   Compilation improvements
       As part of the flattening of ext, all extensions on all platforms are
       built by make_ext.pl. This replaces the Unix-specific
       ext/util/make_ext, VMS-specific make_ext.com and Win32-specific
       win32/buildext.pl.

   Platform Specific Changes
       AIX Removed libbsd for AIX 5L and 6.1. Only flock() was used from
           libbsd.

           Removed libgdbm for AIX 5L and 6.1. The libgdbm is delivered as an
           optional package with the AIX Toolbox. Unfortunately the 64 bit
           version is broken.

           Hints changes mean that AIX 4.2 should work again.

       Cygwin
           On Cygwin we now strip the last number from the DLL. This has been
           the behaviour in the cygwin.com build for years. The hints files
           have been updated.

       FreeBSD
           The hints files now identify the correct threading libraries on
           FreeBSD 7 and later.

       Irix
           We now work around a bizarre preprocessor bug in the Irix 6.5
           compiler: "cc -E -" unfortunately goes into K&R mode, but "cc -E
           file.c" doesn't.

       Haiku
           Patches from the Haiku maintainers have been merged in. Perl should
           now build on Haiku.

       MirOS BSD
           Perl should now build on MirOS BSD.

       NetBSD
           Hints now supports versions 5.*.

       Stratus VOS
           Various changes from Stratus have been merged in.

       Symbian
           There is now support for Symbian S60 3.2 SDK and S60 5.0 SDK.

       Win32
           Improved message window handling means that "alarm" and "kill"
           messages will no longer be dropped under race conditions.

       VMS Reads from the in-memory temporary files of "PerlIO::scalar" used
           to fail if $/ was set to a numeric reference (to indicate record-
           style reads).  This is now fixed.

           VMS now supports "getgrgid".

           Many improvements and cleanups have been made to the VMS file name
           handling and conversion code.

           Enabling the "PERL_VMS_POSIX_EXIT" logical name now encodes a POSIX
           exit status in a VMS condition value for better interaction with
           GNV's bash shell and other utilities that depend on POSIX exit
           values.  See "$?" in perlvms for details.

Selected Bug Fixes
       o   5.10.0 inadvertently disabled an optimisation, which caused a
           measurable performance drop in list assignment, such as is often
           used to assign function parameters from @_. The optimisation has
           been re-instated, and the performance regression fixed.

       o   Fixed memory leak on "while (1) { map 1, 1 }" [RT #53038].

       o   Some potential coredumps in PerlIO fixed [RT #57322,54828].

       o   The debugger now works with lvalue subroutines.

       o   The debugger's "m" command was broken on modules that defined
           constants [RT #61222].

       o   "crypt()" and string complement could return tainted values for
           untainted arguments [RT #59998].

       o   The "-i.suffix" command-line switch now recreates the file using
           restricted permissions, before changing its mode to match the
           original file. This eliminates a potential race condition [RT
           #60904].

       o   On some Unix systems, the value in $? would not have the top bit
           set ("$? & 128") even if the child core dumped.

       o   Under some circumstances, $^R could incorrectly become undefined
           [RT #57042].

       o   (XS) In various hash functions, passing a pre-computed hash to when
           the key is UTF-8 might result in an incorrect lookup.

       o   (XS) Including XSUB.h before perl.h gave a compile-time error [RT
           #57176].

       o   "$object->isa('Foo')" would report false if the package "Foo"
           didn't exist, even if the object's @ISA contained "Foo".

       o   Various bugs in the new-to 5.10.0 mro code, triggered by
           manipulating @ISA, have been found and fixed.

       o   Bitwise operations on references could crash the interpreter, e.g.
           "$x=\$y; $x |= "foo"" [RT #54956].

       o   Patterns including alternation might be sensitive to the internal
           UTF-8 representation, e.g.

               my $byte = chr(192);
               my $utf8 = chr(192); utf8::upgrade($utf8);
               $utf8 =~ /$byte|X}/i;       # failed in 5.10.0

       o   Within UTF8-encoded Perl source files (i.e. where "use utf8" is in
           effect), double-quoted literal strings could be corrupted where a
           "\xNN", "\0NNN" or "\N{}" is followed by a literal character with
           ordinal value greater than 255 [RT #59908].

       o   "B::Deparse" failed to correctly deparse various constructs:
           "readpipe STRING" [RT #62428], "CORE::require(STRING)" [RT #62488],
           "sub foo(_)" [RT #62484].

       o   Using "setpgrp()" with no arguments could corrupt the perl stack.

       o   The block form of "eval" is now specifically trappable by "Safe"
           and "ops".  Previously it was erroneously treated like string
           "eval".

       o   In 5.10.0, the two characters "[~" were sometimes parsed as the
           smart match operator ("~~") [RT #63854].

       o   In 5.10.0, the "*" quantifier in patterns was sometimes treated as
           "{0,32767}" [RT #60034, #60464]. For example, this match would
           fail:

               ("ab" x 32768) =~ /^(ab)*$/

       o   "shmget" was limited to a 32 bit segment size on a 64 bit OS [RT
           #63924].

       o   Using "next" or "last" to exit a "given" block no longer produces a
           spurious warning like the following:

               Exiting given via last at foo.pl line 123

       o   On Windows, '.\foo' and '..\foo'  were treated differently than
           './foo' and '../foo' by "do" and "require" [RT #63492].

       o   Assigning a format to a glob could corrupt the format; e.g.:

                *bar=*foo{FORMAT}; # foo format now bad

       o   Attempting to coerce a typeglob to a string or number could cause
           an assertion failure. The correct error message is now generated,
           "Can't coerce GLOB to $type".

       o   Under "use filetest 'access'", "-x" was using the wrong access
           mode. This has been fixed [RT #49003].

       o   "length" on a tied scalar that returned a Unicode value would not
           be correct the first time. This has been fixed.

       o   Using an array "tie" inside in array "tie" could SEGV. This has
           been fixed. [RT #51636]

       o   A race condition inside "PerlIOStdio_close()" has been identified
           and fixed. This used to cause various threading issues, including
           SEGVs.

       o   In "unpack", the use of "()" groups in scalar context was
           internally placing a list on the interpreter's stack, which
           manifested in various ways, including SEGVs.  This is now fixed [RT
           #50256].

       o   Magic was called twice in "substr", "\&$x", "tie $x, $m" and
           "chop".  These have all been fixed.

       o   A 5.10.0 optimisation to clear the temporary stack within the
           implicit loop of "s///ge" has been reverted, as it turned out to be
           the cause of obscure bugs in seemingly unrelated parts of the
           interpreter [commit ef0d4e17921ee3de].

       o   The line numbers for warnings inside "elsif" are now correct.

       o   The ".." operator now works correctly with ranges whose ends are at
           or close to the values of the smallest and largest integers.

       o   "binmode STDIN, ':raw'" could lead to segmentation faults on some
           platforms.  This has been fixed [RT #54828].

       o   An off-by-one error meant that "index $str, ..." was effectively
           being executed as "index "$str\0", ...". This has been fixed [RT
           #53746].

       o   Various leaks associated with named captures in regexes have been
           fixed [RT #57024].

       o   A weak reference to a hash would leak. This was affecting "DBI" [RT
           #56908].

       o   Using (?|) in a regex could cause a segfault [RT #59734].

       o   Use of a UTF-8 "tr//" within a closure could cause a segfault [RT
           #61520].

       o   Calling "sv_chop()" or otherwise upgrading an SV could result in an
           unaligned 64-bit access on the SPARC architecture [RT #60574].

       o   In the 5.10.0 release, "inc_version_list" would incorrectly list
           "5.10.*" after "5.8.*"; this affected the @INC search order [RT
           #67628].

       o   In 5.10.0, "pack "a*", $tainted_value" returned a non-tainted value
           [RT #52552].

       o   In 5.10.0, "printf" and "sprintf" could produce the fatal error
           "panic: utf8_mg_pos_cache_update" when printing UTF-8 strings [RT
           #62666].

       o   In the 5.10.0 release, a dynamically created "AUTOLOAD" method
           might be missed (method cache issue) [RT #60220,60232].

       o   In the 5.10.0 release, a combination of "use feature" and "//ee"
           could cause a memory leak [RT #63110].

       o   "-C" on the shebang ("#!") line is once more permitted if it is
           also specified on the command line. "-C" on the shebang line used
           to be a silent no-op if it was not also on the command line, so
           perl 5.10.0 disallowed it, which broke some scripts. Now perl
           checks whether it is also on the command line and only dies if it
           is not [RT #67880].

       o   In 5.10.0, certain types of re-entrant regular expression could
           crash, or cause the following assertion failure [RT #60508]:

               Assertion rx->sublen >= (s - rx->subbeg) + i failed

New or Changed Diagnostics
       "panic: sv_chop %s"
           This new fatal error occurs when the C routine "Perl_sv_chop()" was
           passed a position that is not within the scalar's string buffer.
           This could be caused by buggy XS code, and at this point recovery
           is not possible.

       "Can't locate package %s for the parents of %s"
           This warning has been removed. In general, it only got produced in
           conjunction with other warnings, and removing it allowed an ISA
           lookup optimisation to be added.

       "v-string in use/require is non-portable"
           This warning has been removed.

       "Deep recursion on subroutine "%s""
           It is now possible to change the depth threshold for this warning
           from the default of 100, by recompiling the perl binary, setting
           the C pre-processor macro "PERL_SUB_DEPTH_WARN" to the desired
           value.

Changed Internals
       o   The J.R.R. Tolkien quotes at the head of C source file have been
           checked and proper citations added, thanks to a patch from Tom
           Christiansen.

       o   "vcroak()" now accepts a null first argument. In addition, a full
           audit was made of the "not NULL" compiler annotations, and those
           for several other internal functions were corrected.

       o   New macros "dSAVEDERRNO", "dSAVE_ERRNO", "SAVE_ERRNO",
           "RESTORE_ERRNO" have been added to formalise the temporary saving
           of the "errno" variable.

       o   The function "Perl_sv_insert_flags" has been added to augment
           "Perl_sv_insert".

       o   The function "Perl_newSV_type(type)" has been added, equivalent to
           "Perl_newSV()" followed by "Perl_sv_upgrade(type)".

       o   The function "Perl_newSVpvn_flags()" has been added, equivalent to
           "Perl_newSVpvn()" and then performing the action relevant to the
           flag.

           Two flag bits are currently supported.

           "SVf_UTF8"
               This will call "SvUTF8_on()" for you. (Note that this does not
               convert an sequence of ISO 8859-1 characters to UTF-8). A
               wrapper, "newSVpvn_utf8()" is available for this.

           "SVs_TEMP"
               Call "sv_2mortal()" on the new SV.

           There is also a wrapper that takes constant strings,
           "newSVpvs_flags()".

       o   The function "Perl_croak_xs_usage" has been added as a wrapper to
           "Perl_croak".

       o   The functions "PerlIO_find_layer" and "PerlIO_list_alloc" are now
           exported.

       o   "PL_na" has been exterminated from the core code, replaced by local
           STRLEN temporaries, or "*_nolen()" calls. Either approach is faster
           than "PL_na", which is a pointer deference into the interpreter
           structure under ithreads, and a global variable otherwise.

       o   "Perl_mg_free()" used to leave freed memory accessible via
           SvMAGIC() on the scalar. It now updates the linked list to remove
           each piece of magic as it is freed.

       o   Under ithreads, the regex in "PL_reg_curpm" is now reference
           counted. This eliminates a lot of hackish workarounds to cope with
           it not being reference counted.

       o   "Perl_mg_magical()" would sometimes incorrectly turn on
           "SvRMAGICAL()".  This has been fixed.

       o   The public IV and NV flags are now not set if the string value has
           trailing "garbage". This behaviour is consistent with not setting
           the public IV or NV flags if the value is out of range for the
           type.

       o   SV allocation tracing has been added to the diagnostics enabled by
           "-Dm".  The tracing can alternatively output via the "PERL_MEM_LOG"
           mechanism, if that was enabled when the perl binary was compiled.

       o   Uses of "Nullav", "Nullcv", "Nullhv", "Nullop", "Nullsv" etc have
           been replaced by "NULL" in the core code, and non-dual-life
           modules, as "NULL" is clearer to those unfamiliar with the core
           code.

       o   A macro MUTABLE_PTR(p) has been added, which on (non-pedantic) gcc
           will not cast away "const", returning a "void *". Macros
           "MUTABLE_SV(av)", "MUTABLE_SV(cv)" etc build on this, casting to
           "AV *" etc without casting away "const". This allows proper
           compile-time auditing of "const" correctness in the core, and
           helped picked up some errors (now fixed).

       o   Macros "mPUSHs()" and "mXPUSHs()" have been added, for pushing SVs
           on the stack and mortalizing them.

       o   Use of the private structure "mro_meta" has changed slightly.
           Nothing outside the core should be accessing this directly anyway.

       o   A new tool, "Porting/expand-macro.pl" has been added, that allows
           you to view how a C preprocessor macro would be expanded when
           compiled.  This is handy when trying to decode the macro hell that
           is the perl guts.

New Tests
       Many modules updated from CPAN incorporate new tests.

       Several tests that have the potential to hang forever if they fail now
       incorporate a "watchdog" functionality that will kill them after a
       timeout, which helps ensure that "make test" and "make test_harness"
       run to completion automatically. (Jerry Hedden).

       Some core-specific tests have been added:

       t/comp/retainedlines.t
           Check that the debugger can retain source lines from "eval".

       t/io/perlio_fail.t
           Check that bad layers fail.

       t/io/perlio_leaks.t
           Check that PerlIO layers are not leaking.

       t/op/index_thr.t
           Tests for the interaction of "index" and threads.

       t/op/pat_thr.t

           Test that "qr" doesn't leak.

       t/op/reg_email_thr.t
           Tests for the interaction of regex recursion and threads.

       t/op/regexp_qr_embed_thr.t
           Tests for the interaction of patterns with embedded "qr//" and
           threads.

Known Problems
       This is a list of some significant unfixed bugs, which are regressions
       from either 5.10.0 or 5.8.x.

       o   "List::Util::first" misbehaves in the presence of a lexical $_
           (typically introduced by "my $_" or implicitly by "given"). The
           variable which gets set for each iteration is the package variable
           $_, not the lexical $_ [RT #67694].

           A similar issue may occur in other modules that provide functions
           which take a block as their first argument, like

               foo { ... $_ ...} list

       o   The "charnames" pragma may generate a run-time error when a regex
           is interpolated [RT #56444]:

               use charnames ':full';
               my $r1 = qr/\N{THAI CHARACTER SARA I}/;
               "foo" =~ $r1;    # okay
               "foo" =~ /$r1+/; # runtime error

           A workaround is to generate the character outside of the regex:

               my $a = "\N{THAI CHARACTER SARA I}";
               my $r1 = qr/$a/;

       o   Some regexes may run much more slowly when run in a child thread
           compared with the thread the pattern was compiled into [RT #55600].

Deprecations
       The following items are now deprecated.

       o   "Switch" is buggy and should be avoided. From perl 5.11.0 onwards,
           it is intended that any use of the core version of this module will
           emit a warning, and that the module will eventually be removed from
           the core (probably in perl 5.14.0). See "Switch statements" in
           perlsyn for its replacement.

       o   "suidperl" will be removed in 5.12.0. This provides a mechanism to
           emulate setuid permission bits on systems that don't support it
           properly.

Acknowledgements
       Some of the work in this release was funded by a TPF grant.

       Nicholas Clark officially retired from maintenance pumpking duty at the
       end of 2008; however in reality he has put much effort in since then to
       help get 5.10.1 into a fit state to be released, including writing a
       considerable chunk of this perldelta.

       Steffen Mueller and David Golden in particular helped getting CPAN
       modules polished and synchronised with their in-core equivalents.

       Craig Berry was tireless in getting maint to run under VMS, no matter
       how many times we broke it for him.

       The other core committers contributed most of the changes, and applied
       most of the patches sent in by the hundreds of contributors listed in
       AUTHORS.

       (Sorry to all the people I haven't mentioned by name).

       Finally, thanks to Larry Wall, without whom none of this would be
       necessary.

Reporting Bugs
       If you find what you think is a bug, you might check the articles
       recently posted to the comp.lang.perl.misc newsgroup and the perl bug
       database at http://rt.perl.org/perlbug/ .  There may also be
       information at http://www.perl.org/ , the Perl Home Page.

       If you believe you have an unreported bug, please run the perlbug
       program included with your release.  Be sure to trim your bug down to a
       tiny but sufficient test case.  Your bug report, along with the output
       of "perl -V", will be sent off to perlbug@perl.org to be analysed by
       the Perl porting team.

       If the bug you are reporting has security implications, which make it
       inappropriate to send to a publicly archived mailing list, then please
       send it to perl5-security-report@perl.org. This points to a closed
       subscription unarchived mailing list, which includes all the core
       committers, who will be able to help assess the impact of issues,
       figure out a resolution, and help co-ordinate the release of patches to
       mitigate or fix the problem across all platforms on which Perl is
       supported. Please only use this address for security issues in the Perl
       core, not for modules independently distributed on CPAN.
