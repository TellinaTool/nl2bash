NAME
       tkcon - Tk console replacement

SYNOPSIS
       tkcon [{option value | tcl_script} ...]

_________________________________________________________________

DESCRIPTION
       TkCon  is a replacement for the standard console that comes with Tk (on
       Windows/Mac, but also works on Unix).  The console itself provides many
       more  features than the standard console.  TkCon works on all platforms
       where Tcl/Tk is available.  It is meant primarily to aid one when work-
       ing  with  the  little details inside Tcl and Tk, giving Unix users the
       GUI console provided by default in the Mac and Windows Tk.

       tkcon [{option value | tcl_script} ...]


OPTIONS
       Except for -rcfile, command line arguments are handled after the  TkCon
       resource file is sourced, but before the slave interpreter or the TkCon
       user interface is initialized.

       -rcfile is handled right before it would be sourced,  allowing  you  to
       specify  any alternate file.  Command line arguments are passed to each
       new console and will be evaluated by each.  To prevent this  from  hap-
       pening, you have to say

       tkcon main set argv {}; tkcon main set argc 0


       For these options, any unique substring is allowed.

       -argv (also --)
              Causes  TkCon to stop evaluating arguments and set the remaining
              args to be argv/argc (with -- prepended).  This carries over for
              any  further  consoles.   This  is meant only for wrapping TkCon
              around programs that require their own arguments.

       -color-<color> color
              Sets the requested color type to the specified color for  tkcon.
              See tkconrc(5) for the recognized <color> names.

       -eval tcl_script (also -main or -e)
              A  Tcl  script to eval in each main interpreter.  This is evalu-
              ated after the resource file is loaded and the slave interpreter
              is  created.   Multiple  -eval  switches  will be recognized (in
              order).

       -exec slavename
              Sets the named slave that tkcon operates in.  In  general,  this
              is  only  useful  to  set  to "" (empty), indicating to tkcon to
              avoid the multi-interpreter model and operate in the main  envi-
              ronment.  When this is empty, any further arguments will be only
              used in the first tkcon console and not passed onto further  new
              consoles.   This  is  useful  when  using tkcon as a console for
              extended wish executables that don't load  there  commands  into
              slave interpreters.

       -font font
              Sets  the  font  that  tkcon uses for its text windows.  If this
              isn't a fixed width font, tkcon will override it.

       -nontcl TCL_BOOLEAN
              Sets  ::tkcon::OPT(nontcl)  to  TCL_BOOLEAN  (see   tkconrc(5)).
              Needed when attaching to non-Tcl interpreters.

       -package package_name (also -load)
              Packages to automatically load into the slave interpreters (i.e.
              "Tk").

       -rcfile filename
              Specify an alternate tkcon resource file name.

       -root widgetname
              Makes the named widget the  root  name  of  all  consoles  (i.e.
              .tkcon).

       -slave tcl_script
              A  Tcl  script  to  eval  in  each slave interpreter.  This will
              append the one specified in the tkcon resource file, if any.


KEY BINDINGS
       Most of the bindings are the same as for the text  widget.   Some  have
       been  modified  to make sure that the integrity of the console is main-
       tained.  Others have been added to enhance the usefulness of  the  con-
       sole.  Only the modified or new bindings are listed here.

       Control-x or Cut (on Sparc5 keyboards)
              Cut.

       Control-c or Copy (on Sparc5 keyboards)
              Copy.

       Control-v or Paste (on Sparc5 keyboards)
              Paste.

       Insert Insert (duh).

       Up     Goes up one level in the commands line history when cursor is on
              the prompt line, otherwise it moves through the buffer.

       Down   Goes down one level in the commands line history when cursor  is
              on  the  last line of the buffer, otherwise it moves through the
              buffer.

       Control-p
              Goes up one level in the commands line history.

       Control-n
              Goes down one level in the commands line history.

       Tab    Tries to expand file path names, then variable names, then  proc
              names.

       Escape Tries to expand file path names.

       Control-P
              Tries  to  expand  procedure names.  The procedure names will be
              those that are actually  in  the  attached  interpreter  (unless
              nontcl  is specified, in which case it always does the lookup in
              the default slave interpreter).

       Control-V
              Tries to expand variable names (those returned by [info  vars]).
              It's search behavior is like that for procedure names.

       Return or Enter
              Evaluates  the current command line if it is a complete command,
              otherwise it just goes to a new line.

       Control-a
              Go to the beginning of the current command line.

       Control-l
              Clear the entire console buffer.

       Control-r
              Searches backwards in the history for any command that  contains
              the  string  in  the current command line.  Repeatable to search
              farther back.  The matching substring off the found command will
              blink.

       Control-s
              As  above, but searches forward (only useful if you searched too
              far back).

       Control-t
              Transposes characters.

       Control-u
              Clears the current command line.

       Control-z
              Saves current command line in a buffer  that  can  be  retrieved
              with  another  Control-z.  If the current command line is empty,
              then any saved command is retrieved without  being  overwritten,
              otherwise  the  current  contents get swapped with what's in the
              saved command buffer.

       Control-Key-1
              Attaches console to the console's slave interpreter.

       Control-Key-2
              Attaches console to the console's master interpreter.

       Control-Key-3
              Attaches console to main TkCon interpreter.

       Control-A
              Pops up the "About" dialog.

       Control-N
              Creates a new console. Each console has separate state,  includ-
              ing it's own widget hierarchy (it's a slave interpreter).

       Control-q
              Close  the  current  console OR Quit the program (depends on the
              value of ::tkcon::TKCON(slaveexit)).

       Control-w
              Closes the current console.  Closing the main console will  exit
              the program (something has to control all the slaves...).


       TkCon  also  has  electric bracing (similar to that in emacs).  It will
       highlight matching pairs of {}'s, []'s, ()'s and ""'s.  For  the  first
       three,  if  there  is  no  matching left element for the right, then it
       blinks the entire current command line.  For the double quote, if there
       is no proper match then it just blinks the current double quote charac-
       ter.   It  does  properly  recognize  most  escaping  (except   escaped
       escapes), but does not look for commenting (why would you interactively
       put comments in?).

COMMANDS
       There are several new procedures introduced in TkCon to improve produc-
       tivity  and/or  account  for  lost functionality in the Tcl environment
       that users are used to in native environments.   There  are  also  some
       redefined procedures.  Here is a non-comprehensive list:

       alias ?sourceCmd targetCmd ?arg arg ...??
              Simple  alias  mechanism.   It will overwrite existing commands.
              When called without args, it returns current aliases.  Note that
              TkCon  makes  some  aliases  for  you (in slaves).  Don't delete
              those.

       clear ?percentage?
              Clears the text widget.  Same as the <Control-l> binding, except
              this will accept a percentage of the buffer to clear (1-100, 100
              default).

       dir ?-all? ?-full? ?-long? ?pattern pattern ...?
              Cheap way to get directory listings.  Uses  glob  style  pattern
              matching.

       dump type ?-nocomplain? ?-filter pattern? ?--? pattern ?pattern ...?
              The  dump  command provides a way for the user to spit out state
              information about the interpreter in a Tcl readable  (and  human
              readable) form.  See dump(n) for details.

       echo ?arg arg ...?
              Concatenates  the args and spits the result to the console (std-
              out).

       edit ?-type type? ?-find str? ?-attach interp? arg
              Opens an editor with the data from arg.  The optional type argu-
              ment can be one of: proc, var or file.  For proc or var, the arg
              may be a pattern.

       idebug command ?args?
              Interactive debugging command.  See idebug(n) for details.

       lremove ?-all? ?-regexp -glob? list items
              Removes one or more items from a list and returns the new  list.
              If  -all  is specified, it removes all instances of each item in
              the list.  If -regexp or -glob is specified, it interprets  each
              item  in  the  items  list  as a regexp or glob pattern to match
              against.

       less   Aliased to edit.

       ls     Aliased to dir -full.

       more   Aliased to edit.

       observe type ?args?
              This command provides passive runtime debugging output for vari-
              ables and commands.  See observe(n) for details.

       puts (same options as always)
              Redefined to put the output into TkCon.

       tkcon method ?args?
              Multi-purpose command.  See tkcon(n) for details.

       tclindex   ?-extensions  patternlist?  ?-index  TCL_BOOLEAN?  ?-package
       TCL_BOOLEAN? ?dir1 dir2 ...?
              Convenience  proc to update the "tclIndex" (controlled by -index
              switch) and/or "pkgIndex.tcl" (controlled  by  -package  switch)
              file  in  the  named  directories based on the given pattern for
              files.  It defaults to  creating  the  "tclIndex"  but  not  the
              "pkgIndex.tcl"  file,  with  the  directory defaulting to [pwd].
              The extension defaults to *.tcl, with *.[info sharelibextension]
              added when -package is true.

       unalias cmd
              unaliases command.

       what string
              The  what  command will identify the word given in string in the
              Tcl environment and return a list of types that  it  was  recog-
              nized  as.  Possible types are: alias, procedure, command, array
              variable, scalar variable, directory,  file,  widget,  and  exe-
              cutable.  Used by procedures dump and which.

       which command
              Like  the  which command of Unix shells, this will tell you if a
              particular command is known, and if so, whether it  is  internal
              or  external  to  the interpreter.  If it is an internal command
              and there is a slot in auto_index for it, it tells you the  file
              that auto_index would load.  This does not necessarily mean that
              that is where the file came from, but if  it  were  not  in  the
              interpreter  previously,  then  that  is  where  the command was
              found.


       There are several procedures that I use as helpers that some  may  find
       helpful  in  there coding (i.e. expanding pathnames). Feel free to lift
       them from the code (but do assign proper attribution).

EXAMLPES
       Some examples of tkcon command line startup situations:

       megawish /usr/bin/tkcon -exec "" -root .tkcon mainfile.tcl

       Use tkcon as a console for your megawish application.   You  can  avoid
       starting  the line with megawish if that is the default wish that TkCon
       would use.  The -root ensures that tkcon will  not  conflict  with  the
       application root window.

       tkcon -font "Courier 12" -load Tk

       Use the courier font for TkCon and always load Tk in slave interpreters
       at startup.

       tkcon -rcfile ~/.wishrc -color-bg white

       Use the ~/.wishrc file as the resource file, and a white background for
       TkCon's text widgets.

FILES
       TkCon  will  search  for  a resource file in "~/.tkconrc".  TkCon never
       sources the "~/.wishrc" file.  The resource file is sourced by each new
       instance  of  the  console.   An  example  resource file is provided in
       tkconrc(5).
