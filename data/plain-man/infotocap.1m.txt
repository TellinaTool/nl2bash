NAME
       infotocap - convert a terminfo description into a termcap description

SYNOPSIS
       infotocap [-vn width]  [-V] [-1] [-w width] file . . .

DESCRIPTION
       infotocap looks in file for terminfo descriptions.  For each one found,
       an equivalent termcap description is written to standard output.   Ter-
       minfo  use capabilities are translated directly to termcap tc capabili-
       ties.

       -v   print out tracing information on standard  error  as  the  program
            runs.

       -V   print  out the version of the program in use on standard error and
            exit.

       -1   cause the fields to print out  one  to  a  line.   Otherwise,  the
            fields  will be printed several to a line to a maximum width of 60
            characters.

       -w   change the output to width characters.
