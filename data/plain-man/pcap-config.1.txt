NAME
       pcap-config  - write libpcap compiler and linker flags to standard out-
       put

SYNOPSIS
       pcap-config [ --static ] [ --cflags | --libs | --additional-libs ]

DESCRIPTION
       When run with the --cflags option, pcap-config writes to  the  standard
       output  the  -I  compiler  flags  required  to include libpcap's header
       files.  When run with the --libs  option,  pcap-config  writes  to  the
       standard  output the -L and -l linker flags required to link with libp-
       cap, including -l flags for libraries required by  libpcap.   When  run
       with  the  --additional-libs option, pcap-config writes to the standard
       output the -L and -l flags for libraries required by libpcap,  but  not
       the -lpcap flag to link with libpcap itself.

       By  default,  it  writes flags appropriate for compiling with a dynami-
       cally-linked version of libpcap; the --static flag causes it  to  write
       flags  appropriate  for  compiling  with a statically-linked version of
       libpcap.
