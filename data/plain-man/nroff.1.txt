NROFF(1)                                                              NROFF(1)



NAME
       nroff - emulate nroff command with groff

SYNOPSIS
       nroff [ -CchipStUv ] [ -dcs ] [ -Mdir ] [ -mname ] [ -nnum ] [ -olist ]
             [ -rcn ] [ -Tname ] [ file ... ]

DESCRIPTION
       The nroff script emulates the nroff command using groff.   Only  ascii,
       latin1, utf8, and cp1047 are valid arguments for the -T option, select-
       ing the output encoding emitted by grotty, groff's TTY  output  device.
       If an invalid or no -T option is given, nroff checks the current locale
       to select a default output device.  It first tries the locale  program,
       then  the environment variables LC_ALL, LC_CTYPE, and LANG, and finally
       the LESSCHARSET environment variable.

       The -h and -c options are equivalent to grotty's options -h (using tabs
       in  the  output)  and  -c  (using  the old output scheme instead of SGR
       escape sequences).  The -d, -C, -i, -M, -m, -n, -o, and -r options have
       the  effect described in troff(1).  In addition, nroff silently ignores
       the options -e, -q, and  -s  (which  are  not  implemented  in  troff).
       Options  -p  (pic), -t (tbl), -S (safer), and -U (unsafe) are passed to
       groff.  -v shows the version number.

ENVIRONMENT
       GROFF_BIN_PATH
              A colon separated list of directories in which to search for the
              groff executable before searching in PATH.  If unset, `/usr/bin'
              is used.

NOTES
       This shell script is basically intended for use with man(1),  so  warn-
       ings  are  suppressed.   nroff-style character definitions (in the file
       tty-char.tmac) are also loaded to emulate unrepresentable glyphs.
