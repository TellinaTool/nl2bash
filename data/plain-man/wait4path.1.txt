WAIT4PATH(1)              BSD General Commands Manual             WAIT4PATH(1)

NAME
     wait4path -- wait for given path to show up in the namespace

SYNOPSIS
     wait4path <path>

DESCRIPTION
     The wait4path program simply checks to see if the given path exists, and
     if so, it exits.  Otherwise, it sleeps until the mount table is updated
     and checks again. The program will loop indefinitely until the path shows
     up in the file system namespace.
