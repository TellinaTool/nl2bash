NAME
     mdimport, mdimport32 -- import file hierarchies into the metadata datas-
     tore.

SYNOPSIS
     mdimport [-VXLArgn] [-d level | category] [-w delay] file | directory
     mdimport32 [-VXLArgn] [-d level | category] [-w delay] file | directory

DESCRIPTION
     mdimport is used to test Spotlight plug-ins, list the installed plug-ins
     and schema, and re-index files handled by a plug-in when a new plug-in is
     installed.

     mdimport32 is used in exactly the same way, but for 32 bit plugins.

     The following options are available:

     -g plugin   Load the plugin at the provided path, ignoring system
                 installed plugins.  Useful for testing plugins that have not
                 yet been installed.

     -V          Print timing information for this run of mdimport.

     -A          Print out the list of all of the attributes and their local-
                 izations in the current language and exit.

     -X          Print the schema file and exit

     -r          Ask the server to reimport files for UTIs claimed by the
                 listed plugin.  For example, the following would cause all of
                 the chat files on the system to be reimported:

                       mdimport -r /System/Library/Spotlight/Chat.mdimporter

     -p          Print out performance information gathered during the run.

     -L          Print the list of installed importers and exit.

     -d level    Print debugging information.  Level can be 1-4.

     -n          Don't actually set the attributes on the file.  Useful for
                 debugging.

     -w msecs    Wait for the specified interval between scanning files.

NOTES
     The -f switch is obsolete in Leopard and beyond.
