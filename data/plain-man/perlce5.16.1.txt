NAME
       perlce - Perl for WinCE

Building Perl for WinCE
   DESCRIPTION
       This file gives the instructions for building Perl5.8 and above for
       WinCE.  Please read and understand the terms under which this software
       is distributed.

   General explanations on cross-compiling WinCE
       o   miniperl is built. This is a single executable (without DLL),
           intended to run on Win32, and it will facilitate remaining build
           process; all binaries built after it are foreign and should not run
           locally.

           miniperl is built using ./win32/Makefile; this is part of normal
           build process invoked as dependency from wince/Makefile.ce

       o   After miniperl is built, configpm is invoked to create right
           Config.pm in right place and its corresponding Cross.pm.

           Unlike Win32 build, miniperl will not have Config.pm of host within
           reach; it rather will use Config.pm from within cross-compilation
           directories.

           File Cross.pm is dead simple: for given cross-architecture places
           in @INC a path where perl modules are, and right Config.pm in that
           place.

           That said, "miniperl -Ilib -MConfig -we 1" should report an error,
           because it can not find Config.pm. If it does not give an error --
           wrong Config.pm is substituted, and resulting binaries will be a
           mess.

           "miniperl -MCross -MConfig -we 1" should run okay, and it will
           provide right Config.pm for further compilations.

       o   During extensions build phase, a script ./win32/buldext.pl is
           invoked, which in turn steps in ./ext subdirectories and performs a
           build of each extension in turn.

           All invokes of Makefile.PL are provided with "-MCross" so to enable
           cross- compile.

   BUILD
       This section describes the steps to be performed to build PerlCE.  You
       may find additional information about building perl for WinCE at
       <http://perlce.sourceforge.net> and some pre-built binaries.

       Tools & SDK

       For compiling, you need following:

       o   Microsoft Embedded Visual Tools

       o   Microsoft Visual C++

       o   Rainer Keuchel's celib-sources

       o   Rainer Keuchel's console-sources

       Needed source files can be downloaded at
       <http://perlce.sourceforge.net>

       Make

       Normally you only need to edit ./win32/ce-helpers/compile.bat to
       reflect your system and run it.

       File ./win32/ce-helpers/compile.bat is actually a wrapper to call
       "nmake -f makefile.ce" with appropriate parameters and it accepts extra
       parameters and forwards them to "nmake" command as additional
       arguments. You should pass target this way.

       To prepare distribution you need to do following:

       o   go to ./win32 subdirectory

       o   edit file ./win32/ce-helpers/compile.bat

       o   run
             compile.bat

       o   run
             compile.bat dist

       Makefile.ce has "CROSS_NAME" macro, and it is used further to refer to
       your cross-compilation scheme. You could assign a name to it, but this
       is not necessary, because by default it is assigned after your machine
       configuration name, such as "wince-sh3-hpc-wce211", and this is enough
       to distinguish different builds at the same time. This option could be
       handy for several different builds on same platform to perform, say,
       threaded build. In a following example we assume that all required
       environment variables are set properly for C cross-compiler (a special
       *.bat file could fit perfectly to this purpose) and your compile.bat
       has proper "MACHINE" parameter set, to, say,
       "wince-mips-pocket-wce300".

         compile.bat
         compile.bat dist
         compile.bat CROSS_NAME=mips-wce300-thr "USE_ITHREADS=define" "USE_IMP_SYS=define" "USE_MULTI=define"
         compile.bat CROSS_NAME=mips-wce300-thr "USE_ITHREADS=define" "USE_IMP_SYS=define" "USE_MULTI=define" dist

       If all goes okay and no errors during a build, you'll get two
       independent distributions: "wince-mips-pocket-wce300" and
       "mips-wce300-thr".

       Target "dist" prepares distribution file set. Target "zipdist" performs
       same as "dist" but additionally compresses distribution files into zip
       archive.

       NOTE: during a build there could be created a number (or one) of
       Config.pm for cross-compilation ("foreign" Config.pm) and those are
       hidden inside ../xlib/$(CROSS_NAME) with other auxiliary files, but,
       and this is important to note, there should be no Config.pm for host
       miniperl.  If you'll get an error that perl could not find Config.pm
       somewhere in building process this means something went wrong. Most
       probably you forgot to specify a cross-compilation when invoking
       miniperl.exe to Makefile.PL When building an extension for cross-
       compilation your command line should look like

         ..\miniperl.exe -I..\lib -MCross=mips-wce300-thr Makefile.PL

       or just

         ..\miniperl.exe -I..\lib -MCross Makefile.PL

       to refer a cross-compilation that was created last time.

       perlce-user@lists.sourceforge.net mailing list.

Using Perl on WinCE
   DESCRIPTION
       PerlCE is currently linked with a simple console window, so it also
       works on non-hpc devices.

       The simple stdio implementation creates the files stdin.txt, stdout.txt
       and stderr.txt, so you might examine them if your console has only a
       limited number of cols.

       When exitcode is non-zero, a message box appears, otherwise the console
       closes, so you might have to catch an exit with status 0 in your
       program to see any output.

       stdout/stderr now go into the files /perl-stdout.txt and
       /perl-stderr.txt.

       PerlIDE is handy to deal with perlce.

   LIMITATIONS
       No fork(), pipe(), popen() etc.

   ENVIRONMENT
       All environment vars must be stored in HKLM\Environment as strings.
       They are read at process startup.

       PERL5LIB
           Usual perl lib path (semi-list).

       PATH
           Semi-list for executables.

       TMP - Tempdir.

       UNIXROOTPATH
           - Root for accessing some special files, i.e. /dev/null,
           /etc/services.

       ROWS/COLS
           - Rows/cols for console.

       HOME
           - Home directory.

       CONSOLEFONTSIZE
           - Size for console font.

       You can set these with cereg.exe, a (remote) registry editor or via the
       PerlIDE.

   REGISTRY
       To start perl by clicking on a perl source file, you have to make the
       according entries in HKCR (see ce-helpers/wince-reg.bat).  cereg.exe
       (which must be executed on a desktop pc with ActiveSync) is reported
       not to work on some devices.  You have to create the registry entries
       by hand using a registry editor.

   XS
       The following Win32-Methods are built-in:

               newXS("Win32::GetCwd", w32_GetCwd, file);
               newXS("Win32::SetCwd", w32_SetCwd, file);
               newXS("Win32::GetTickCount", w32_GetTickCount, file);
               newXS("Win32::GetOSVersion", w32_GetOSVersion, file);
               newXS("Win32::IsWinNT", w32_IsWinNT, file);
               newXS("Win32::IsWin95", w32_IsWin95, file);
               newXS("Win32::IsWinCE", w32_IsWinCE, file);
               newXS("Win32::CopyFile", w32_CopyFile, file);
               newXS("Win32::Sleep", w32_Sleep, file);
               newXS("Win32::MessageBox", w32_MessageBox, file);
               newXS("Win32::GetPowerStatus", w32_GetPowerStatus, file);
               newXS("Win32::GetOemInfo", w32_GetOemInfo, file);
               newXS("Win32::ShellEx", w32_ShellEx, file);

   BUGS
       Opening files for read-write is currently not supported if they use
       stdio (normal perl file handles).

       If you find bugs or if it does not work at all on your device, send
       mail to the address below. Please report the details of your device
       (processor, ceversion, devicetype (hpc/palm/pocket)) and the date of
       the downloaded files.

   INSTALLATION
       Currently installation instructions are at
       <http://perlce.sourceforge.net/>.

       After installation & testing processes will stabilize, information will
       be more precise.

ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS
       The port for Win32 was used as a reference.

History of WinCE port
       5.6.0
           Initial port of perl to WinCE. It was performed in separate
           directory named wince. This port was based on contents of ./win32
           directory.  miniperl was not built, user must have HOST perl and
           properly edit makefile.ce to reflect this.

       5.8.0
           wince port was kept in the same ./wince directory, and
           wince/Makefile.ce was used to invoke native compiler to create HOST
           miniperl, which then facilitates cross-compiling process.
           Extension building support was added.

       5.9.4
           Two directories ./win32 and ./wince were merged, so perlce build
           process comes in ./win32 directory.

AUTHORS
       Rainer Keuchel <coyxc@rainer-keuchel.de>
           provided initial port of Perl, which appears to be most essential
           work, as it was a breakthrough on having Perl ported at all.  Many
           thanks and obligations to Rainer!

       Vadim Konovalov
           made further support of WinCE port.
