MIB2C(1)                           Net-SNMP                           MIB2C(1)



NAME
       mib2c -- generate template code for extending the agent

SYNOPSIS
       mib2c  [-h]  -c  CONFIGFILE  [-I  PATH]  [-f  OUTNAME]  [-i][-s][-q][-S
       VAR=VAL] MIBNODE

DESCRIPTION
       The mib2c tool is designed to take  a  portion  of  the  MIB  tree  (as
       defined  by  a  MIB file) and generate the template C code necessary to
       implement the relevant management objects within it.

       In order to implement a new MIB module, three files are necessary:

       - MIB definition file
       - C header file
       - C implementation file.

       The mib2c tool uses the MIB definition file to produce the two  C  code
       files.  Thus, mib2c generates a template that you can edit to add logic
       necessary to obtain information from the operating system  or  applica-
       tion to complete the module.

       MIBNODE  is  the top level mib node you want to generate code for.  You
       must give mib2c a mib node (e.g. ifTable) on the command  line,  not  a
       mib file.  This is the single most common mistake.

       The mib2c tool accepts both SMIv1 and SMIv2 MIBs.

       mib2c needs to be able to find and load a MIB file in order to generate
       C code for the MIB. To enable mib2c to find the MIB file, set the  MIBS
       environment variable to include the MIB file you are using.  An example
       of setting this environment variable is:

          MIBS=+NET-SNMP-TUTORIAL-MIB

          or

          MIBS=ALL

       The first example ensures that mib2c  finds  the  NET-SNMP-TUTORIAL-MIB
       mib,  in  addition  to the default MIB modules. The default list of MIB
       modules is set when the suite is first configured and built  and  basi-
       cally  corresponds to the list of modules that the agent supports.  The
       second example ensures that mib2c finds all MIBs in the search location
       for   MIB   files.  The  default  search  location  for  MIB  files  is
       /usr/share/snmp/mibs. This search location can be modified by the  MIB-
       DIRS environment variable.

       Both  the  MIB  files to be loaded and the MIB file search location can
       also be configured in the snmp.conf file. Please see  snmp.conf(5)  for
       more information.

       The  generated *.c and *.h files will be created in the current working
       directory.

OPTIONS
       -h     Display a help message.

       -c CONFIGFILE
              Use CONFIGFILE  when  generating  code.   These  files  will  be
              searched  for  first  in  the  current directory and then in the
              /usr/share directory (which is where the default mib2c  configu-
              ration  files  can be found).  Running mib2c without the -c CON-
              FIGFILE option will display a description of  the  valid  values
              for  CONFIGFILE,  that is, the available config files, including
              new ones that you might author.

              For example,

              % mib2c ifTable

              will display a description of the currently available values for
              CONFIGFILE.

              The following values are supported for CONFIGFILE:

              mib2c.mfd.conf
              mib2c.scalar.conf
              mib2c.int_watch.conf
              mib2c.iterate.conf
              mib2c.create-dataset.conf
              mib2c.array-user.conf
              mib2c.column_defines.conf
              mib2c.column_enums.conf

              GENERATING CODE FOR SCALAR OBJECTS:

              If you're writing code for some scalars, run:

                   mib2c -c mib2c.scalar.conf MIBNODE

              If  you  want  to  magically  "tie" integer variables to integer
              scalars, use:

                   mib2c -c mib2c.int_watch.conf MIBNODE

              GENERATING CODE FOR TABLES:

              The recommended configuration file for tables is  the  MIBs  for
              Dummies,  or  MFD,  configuration  file. It hides as much of the
              SNMP details as possible, generating small, easy  to  understand
              functions.   It  is  also  the most flexible and well documented
              configuration     file.      See     the      agent/mibgroup/if-
              mib/ifTable/ifTable*.c files for an example:

                      mib2c -c mib2c.mfd.conf MIBNODE

              If your table data is kept somewhere else (e.g. it's in the ker-
              nel and not in the memory of the agent itself) and you  need  to
              "iterate"  over it to find the right data for the SNMP row being
              accessed.  See the agent/mibgroup/mibII/vacm_context.c file  for
              an example:

                   mib2c -c mib2c.iterate.conf MIBNODE

              If  your  table data is kept in the agent (i.e. it's not located
              in an external source) and is purely data driven  (i.e.  you  do
              not  need  to  perform  any  work  when  a set occurs).  See the
              agent/mibgroup/examples/data_set.c file for an example of such a
              table:

                   mib2c -c mib2c.create-dataset.conf MIBNODE

              If  your  table data is kept in the agent (i.e. it's not located
              in an external source), and you can keep your data sorted by the
              table index but you do need to perform work when a set occurs:

                   mib2c -c mib2c.array-user.conf MIBNODE

              GENERATING HEADER FILE DEFINITIONS

              To  generate  just a header with a define for each column number
              in your table:

                   mib2c -c mib2c.column_defines.conf MIBNODE

              To generate just a header with a define for each  enum  for  any
              column containing enums:

                   mib2c -c mib2c.column_enums.conf MIBNODE

                   GENERATING CODE FOR THE 4.X LINE OF CODE (THE OLDER API)

                   mib2c -c mib2c.old-api.conf MIBNODE

       -IPATH Search  for  configuration files in PATH.  Multiple paths can be
              specified using multiple -I switches or  by  using  one  with  a
              comma separated list of paths in it.

       -f OUTNAME
              Places  the  output code into OUTNAME.c and OUTNAME.h. Normally,
              mib2c will place the output code into files which correspond  to
              the  table  names  it  is generating code for, which is probably
              what you want anyway.

       -i     Do not run indent on the resulting code.

       -s     Do not look for MIBNODE.sed and run sed on the  resulting  code.
              This is useful to shorten long mib variable names in the code.

       -q     Run  in  "quiet" mode, which minimizes the status messages mib2c
              generates.

       -SVAR=VAL
              Preset a variable VAR, in the mib2c.*.conf file,  to  the  value
              VAL.   None   of   the   existing   mib2c   configuration  files
              (mib2c.*.conf) currently makes use of this feature, however,  so
              this  option should be considered available only for future use.

EXAMPLES
       The following generates C template code for the header and  implementa-
       tion files to implement UCD-DEMO-MIB::ucdDemoPublic.

              % mib2c -c mib2c.scalar.conf ucdDemoPublic
              writing to ucdDemoPublic.h
              writing to ucdDemoPublic.c
              running indent on ucdDemoPublic.h
              running indent on ucdDemoPublic.c

       The  resulting  ucdDemoPublic.c and ucdDemoPublic.h files are generated
       the current working directory.

       The following generates C template code for the header and  implementa-
       tion files  for the module to implement TCP-MIB::tcpConnTable.

              % mib2c -c mib2c.iterate.conf tcpConnTable
              writing to tcpConnTable.h
              writing to tcpConnTable.c
              running indent on tcpConnTable.h
              running indent on tcpConnTable.c

       The  resulting tcpConnTable.c and tcpConnTable.h files are generated in
       the current working directory.
