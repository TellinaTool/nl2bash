NAME
     erb -- Ruby Templating

SYNOPSIS
     erb [--version] [-UPdnvx] [-E ext[:int]] [-S level] [-T mode]
         [-r library] [--] [file ...]

DESCRIPTION
     erb is a command line front-end for ERB library, which is an implementa-
     tion of eRuby.

     ERB provides an easy to use but powerful templating system for Ruby.
     Using ERB, actual Ruby code can be added to any plain text document for
     the purposes of generating document information details and/or flow con-
     trol.

     erb is a part of Ruby.

OPTIONS
     --version      Prints the version of erb.

     -E external[:internal]
     --encoding external[:internal]
                    Specifies the default value(s) for external encodings and
                    internal encoding. Values should be separated with colon
                    (:).

                    You can omit the one for internal encodings, then the
                    value (Encoding.default_internal) will be nil.

     -P             Evaluates lines starting with % as Ruby code and removes
                    the tailing EOLs.

     -S level       Specifies the safe level in which eRuby script will run.

     -T mode        Specifies trim mode (default 0).  mode can be one of

                          0       EOL remains after the embedded ruby script
                                  is evaluated.

                          1       EOL is removed if the line ends with %>.

                          2       EOL is removed if the line starts with <%
                                  and ends with %>.

                          -       EOL is removed if the line ends with -%>.
                                  And leading whitespaces are removed if the
                                  erb directive starts with <%-.

     -U             can be one of Sets the default value for internal encod-
                    ings (Encoding.default_internal) to UTF-8.

     -d
     --debug        Turns on debug mode.  $DEBUG will be set to true.

     -h
     --help         Prints a summary of the options.

     -n             Used with -x.  Prepends the line number to each line in
                    the output.

     -v             Enables verbose mode.  $VERBOSE will be set to true.

     -x             Converts the eRuby script into Ruby script and prints it
                    without line numbers.

EXAMPLES
     Here is an eRuby script

           <?xml version="1.0" ?>
           <% require 'prime' -%>
           <erb-example>
             <calc><%= 1+1 %></calc>
             <var><%= __FILE__ %></var>
             <library><%= Prime.each(10).to_a.join(", ") %></library>
           </erb-example>

     Command
           % erb -T - example.erb
     prints

           <?xml version="1.0" ?>
           <erb-example>
             <calc>2</calc>
             <var>example.erb</var>
             <library>2, 3, 5, 7</library>
           </erb-example>
