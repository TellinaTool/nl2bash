RLOGIN(1)                 BSD General Commands Manual                RLOGIN(1)

NAME
     rlogin -- remote login

SYNOPSIS
     rlogin [-468DEd] [-e char] [-i localname] [-l username] [username@]host

DESCRIPTION
     The rlogin utility starts a terminal session on a remote host host.

     The standard Berkeley rhosts authorization mechanism is used.

     The following options are available:

     -4    Use IPv4 addresses only.

     -6    Use IPv6 addresses only.

     -8    Allow an eight-bit input data path at all times; otherwise parity
           bits are stripped except when the remote side's stop and start
           characters are other than ^S/^Q.

     -D    Set the TCP_NODELAY socket option which can improve interactive
           response at the expense of increased network load.

     -E    Stop any character from being recognized as an escape character.
           When used with the -8 option, this provides a completely transpar-
           ent connection.

     -d    Turn on socket debugging (see setsockopt(2)) on the TCP sockets
           used for communication with the remote host.

     -e    Allow user specification of the escape character, which is ``~'' by
           default.  This specification may be as a literal character, or as
           an octal value in the form \nnn.

     -i    Allow the caller to specify a different local name to be used for
           authentication.  This option is restricted to processes with uid 0.

     -l    Specify a different username for the remote login.  If this option
           is not specified, your local username will be used.

     A line of the form ``<escape char>.'' disconnects from the remote host.
     Similarly, the line ``<escape char>^Z'' will suspend the rlogin session,
     and ``<escape char><delayed-suspend char>'' suspends the send portion of
     the rlogin session, but allows output from the remote system.  By
     default, the tilde (``~'') character is the escape character, and nor-
     mally control-Y (``^Y'') is the delayed-suspend character.

     All echoing takes place at the remote site, so that (except for delays)
     the rlogin is transparent.  Flow control via ^S/^Q and flushing of input
     and output on interrupts are handled properly.

ENVIRONMENT
     The following environment variable is utilized by rlogin:

     TERM  Determines the user's terminal type.

FILES
     /etc/hosts
     /etc/hosts.equiv
     $HOME/.rhosts

SEE ALSO
     login(1), rsh(1), telnet(1), setsockopt(2), ruserok(3), tty(4), hosts(5),
     hosts.equiv(5), rlogind(8), rshd(8)

HISTORY
     The rlogin command appeared in 4.2BSD.

     IPv6 support was added by WIDE/KAME project.

BUGS
     The rlogin utility will be replaced by telnet(1) in the near future.

     More of the environment should be propagated.
