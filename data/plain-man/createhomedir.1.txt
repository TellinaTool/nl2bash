NAME
     createhomedir -- create and populate home directories on the local com-
     puter.

SYNOPSIS
     createhomedir [-scbalh] [-n directoryDomainName] [-u username]

DESCRIPTION
     createhomedir provides several options for creating and populating home
     directories.

OPTIONS
     -s       creates home directories for server home paths only (default).

     -c       creates home directories for local home paths only.

     -b       creates home directories for both server and local home paths.

     -a       creates home directories for users defined in all directory
              domains of the server's search path.

     -l       creates home directories for users defined in the local direc-
              tory domain.

     -n directoryDomainName
              creates home directories for users defined in a specific direc-
              tory domain in the server's search path.

     -u username
              creates a home directory for a specific user defined in the
              domain(s) identified in the -a, -l, or -n parameter. If you omit
              the -a, -l, and -n parameters when you use the -u parameter, -a
              is assumed.

     -i       reads username list from standard input and creates specified
              home directories. Each username should be on its own line.

     -h       usage help.

FILES
     /usr/sbin/createhomedir                       location of tool

CAVEATS
     When using the -a option, search limits of various directory servers
     (such as Open Directory or Active Directory) can prevent all possible
     home directories from being created. In this case, you may need to spec-
     ify the usernames explicitly.
