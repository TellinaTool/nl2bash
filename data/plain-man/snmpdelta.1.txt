NAME
       snmpdelta - Monitor delta differences in SNMP Counter values

SYNOPSIS
       snmpdelta  [  COMMON  OPTIONS ] [-Cf] [ -Ct ] [ -Cs ] [ -CS ] [ -Cm ] [
       -CF configfile ] [ -Cl ] [ -Cp period ] [ -CP Peaks ] [ -Ck ] [  -CT  ]
       AGENT OID [ OID ... ]

DESCRIPTION
       snmpdelta  will  monitor  the specified integer valued OIDs, and report
       changes over time.

       AGENT identifies a target SNMP agent, which is instrumented to  monitor
       the  given objects.  At its simplest, the AGENT specification will con-
       sist of a hostname or an IPv4 address.  In this situation, the  command
       will  attempt  communication with the agent, using UDP/IPv4 to port 161
       of the given target host. See snmpcmd(1) for a full list of the  possi-
       ble formats for AGENT.

       OID  is  an object identifier which uniquely identifies the object type
       within a MIB. Multiple OIDs can be specified on a single snmpdelta com-
       mand.


OPTIONS
       COMMON OPTIONS
               Please  see snmpcmd(1) for a list of possible values for COMMON
               OPTIONS as well as their descriptions.

       -Cf     Don't fix errors and retry the request.  Without  this  option,
               if  multiple  oids have been specified for a single request and
               if the request for one or more of  the  oids  fails,  snmpdelta
               will  retry  the  request  so that data for oids apart from the
               ones that failed will still be returned.  Specifying -Cf  tells
               snmpdelta  not  to  retry a request, even if there are multiple
               oids specified.

       -Ct     Flag will determine time interval from the monitored entity.

       -Cs     Flag will display a timestamp.

       -CS     Generates a "sum count" in addition to the individual  instance
               counts.   The  "sum  count"  is the total of all the individual
               deltas for each time period.

       -Cm     Prints the max value ever attained.

       -CF configfile
               Tells snmpdelta to read it's configuration from  the  specified
               file.   This  options  allows the input to be set up in advance
               rather than having to be specified on the command line.

       -Cl     Tells snmpdelta to write  it's  configuration  to  files  whose
               names  correspond to the MIB instances monitored.  For example,
               snmpdelta -Cl localhost ifInOctets.1 will create a file "local-
               host-ifInOctets.1".

       -Cp     Specifies  the  number  of  seconds  between  polling  periods.
               Polling constitutes sending a request to the agent. The default
               polling period is one second.

       -CP peaks
               Specifies  the  reporting  period in number of polling periods.
               If this option is specified, snmpdelta polls  the  agent  peaks
               number  of  times  before  reporting  the  results.  The result
               reported includes the average value over the reporting  period.
               In  addition,  the  highest  polled  value within the reporting
               period is shown.

       -Ck     When the polling period (-Cp) is an increment of 60 seconds and
               the  timestamp  is  displayed  in  the  output  (-Cs), then the
               default display shows the timestamp in the format hh:mm  mm/dd.
               This option causes the timestamp format to be hh:mm:ss mm/dd.

       -CT     Makes snmpdelta print its output in tabular form.

       -Cv vars/pkt
               Specifies  the maximum number of oids allowed to be packaged in
               a single PDU. Multiple PDUs can be created in a single request.
               The  default  value of variables per packet is 60.  This option
               is useful if a request response results in an error becaues the
               packet is too big.

       Note that snmpdelta REQUIRES  an argument specifying the agent to query
       and at least one OID argument, as described in  the  snmpcmd(1)  manual
       page.

       The  following example uses a number of options. Since the Cl option is
       specified, the output is sent to a file and not to the screen.

       $ snmpdelta -c public -v 1 -Ct -Cs -CS -Cm -Cl -Cp 60 -CP 60
