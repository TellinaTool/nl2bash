NAME
       perlnetware - Perl for NetWare

DESCRIPTION
       This file gives instructions for building Perl 5.7 and above, and also
       Perl modules for NetWare. Before you start, you may want to read the
       README file found in the top level directory into which the Perl source
       code distribution was extracted. Make sure you read and understand the
       terms under which the software is being distributed.

BUILD
       This section describes the steps to be performed to build a Perl NLM
       and other associated NLMs.

   Tools & SDK
       The build requires CodeWarrior compiler and linker.  In addition, the
       "NetWare SDK", "NLM & NetWare Libraries for C" and "NetWare Server
       Protocol Libraries for C", all available at
       <http://developer.novell.com/wiki/index.php/Category:Novell_Developer_Kit>,
       are required. Microsoft Visual C++ version 4.2 or later is also
       required.

   Setup
       The build process is dependent on the location of the NetWare SDK.
       Once the Tools & SDK are installed, the build environment has to be
       setup.  The following batch files setup the environment.

       SetNWBld.bat
           The Execution of this file takes 2 parameters as input. The first
           being the NetWare SDK path, second being the path for CodeWarrior
           Compiler & tools. Execution of this file sets these paths and also
           sets the build type to Release by default.

       Buildtype.bat
           This is used to set the build type to debug or release. Change the
           build type only after executing SetNWBld.bat

           Example:

           1.  Typing "buildtype d on" at the command prompt causes the
               buildtype to be set to Debug type with D2 flag set.

           2.  Typing "buildtype d off" or "buildtype d" at the command prompt
               causes the buildtype to be set to Debug type with D1 flag set.

           3.  Typing "buildtype r" at the command prompt sets it to Release
               Build type.

   Make
       The make process runs only under WinNT shell.  The NetWare makefile is
       located under the NetWare folder.  This makes use of miniperl.exe to
       run some of the Perl scripts. To create miniperl.exe, first set the
       required paths for Visual c++ compiler (specify vcvars32 location) at
       the command prompt.  Then run nmake from win32 folder through WinNT
       command prompt.  The build process can be stopped after miniperl.exe is
       created. Then run nmake from NetWare folder through WinNT command
       prompt.

       Currently the following two build types are tested on NetWare:

       o   USE_MULTI, USE_ITHREADS & USE_IMP_SYS defined

       o   USE_MULTI & USE_IMP_SYS defined and USE_ITHREADS not defined

   Interpreter
       Once miniperl.exe creation is over, run nmake from the NetWare folder.
       This will build the Perl interpreter for NetWare as perl.nlm.  This is
       copied under the Release folder if you are doing a release build, else
       will be copied under Debug folder for debug builds.

   Extensions
       The make process also creates the Perl extensions as <Extension.nlm>

INSTALL
       To install NetWare Perl onto a NetWare server, first map the Sys volume
       of a NetWare server to i:. This is because the makefile by default sets
       the drive letter to i:.  Type nmake nwinstall from NetWare folder on a
       WinNT command prompt.  This will copy the binaries and module files
       onto the NetWare server under sys:\Perl folder. The Perl interpreter,
       perl.nlm, is copied under sys:\perl\system folder.  Copy this to
       sys:\system folder.

       Example: At the command prompt Type "nmake nwinstall".
                 This will install NetWare Perl on the NetWare Server.
                 Similarly, if you type "nmake install",
                 this will cause the binaries to be installed on the local
       machine.
                 (Typically under the c:\perl folder)

BUILD NEW EXTENSIONS
       To build extensions other than standard extensions, NetWare Perl has to
       be installed on Windows along with Windows Perl. The Perl for Windows
       can be either downloaded from the CPAN site and built using the
       sources, or the binaries can be directly downloaded from the
       ActiveState site.  Installation can be done by invoking nmake install
       from the NetWare folder on a WinNT command prompt after building
       NetWare Perl by following steps given above.  This will copy all the
       *.pm files and other required files.  Documentation files are not
       copied.  Thus one must first install Windows Perl, Then install NetWare
       Perl.

       Once this is done, do the following to build any extension:

       o   Change to the extension directory where its source files are
           present.

       o   Run the following command at the command prompt:

               perl -II<path to NetWare lib dir> -II<path to lib> Makefile.pl

           Example:

               perl -Ic:/perl/5.6.1/lib/NetWare-x86-multi-thread -Ic:\perl\5.6.1\lib MakeFile.pl

           or

               perl -Ic:/perl/5.8.0/lib/NetWare-x86-multi-thread -Ic:\perl\5.8.0\lib MakeFile.pl

       o   nmake

       o   nmake install

           Install will copy the files into the Windows machine where NetWare
           Perl is installed and these files may have to be copied to the
           NetWare server manually. Alternatively, pass
           INSTALLSITELIB=i:\perl\lib as an input to makefile.pl above. Here
           i: is the mapped drive to the sys: volume of the server where Perl
           on NetWare is installed. Now typing nmake install, will copy the
           files onto the NetWare server.

           Example: You can execute the following on the command prompt.

                     perl -Ic:/perl/5.6.1/lib/NetWare-x86-multi-thread -Ic:\perl\5.6.1\lib MakeFile.pl
                     INSTALLSITELIB=i:\perl\lib

           or

                     perl -Ic:/perl/5.8.0/lib/NetWare-x86-multi-thread -Ic:\perl\5.8.0\lib MakeFile.pl
                     INSTALLSITELIB=i:\perl\lib

       o   Note: Some modules downloaded from CPAN may require NetWare related
           API in order to build on NetWare.  Other modules may however build
           smoothly with or without minor changes depending on the type of
           module.

ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS
       The makefile for Win32 is used as a reference to create the makefile
       for NetWare.  Also, the make process for NetWare port uses miniperl.exe
       to run scripts during the make and installation process.
