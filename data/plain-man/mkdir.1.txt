MKDIR(1)                  BSD General Commands Manual                 MKDIR(1)

NAME
     mkdir -- make directories

SYNOPSIS
     mkdir [-pv] [-m mode] directory_name ...

DESCRIPTION
     The mkdir utility creates the directories named as operands, in the order
     specified, using mode rwxrwxrwx (0777) as modified by the current
     umask(2).

     The options are as follows:

     -m mode
             Set the file permission bits of the final created directory to
             the specified mode.  The mode argument can be in any of the for-
             mats specified to the chmod(1) command.  If a symbolic mode is
             specified, the operation characters ``+'' and ``-'' are inter-
             preted relative to an initial mode of ``a=rwx''.

     -p      Create intermediate directories as required.  If this option is
             not specified, the full path prefix of each operand must already
             exist.  On the other hand, with this option specified, no error
             will be reported if a directory given as an operand already
             exists.  Intermediate directories are created with permission
             bits of rwxrwxrwx (0777) as modified by the current umask, plus
             write and search permission for the owner.

     -v      Be verbose when creating directories, listing them as they are
             created.

     The user must have write permission in the parent directory.

DIAGNOSTICS
     The mkdir utility exits 0 on success, and >0 if an error occurs.

SEE ALSO

COMPATIBILITY
     The -v option is non-standard and its use in scripts is not recommended.

STANDARDS
     The mkdir utility is expected to be IEEE Std 1003.2 (``POSIX.2'') compat-
     ible.
