NAME
       clear - clear the terminal screen

SYNOPSIS
       clear

DESCRIPTION
       clear clears your screen if this is possible.  It looks in the environ-
       ment for the terminal type and then in the terminfo database to  figure
       out how to clear the screen.

       clear ignores any command-line parameters that may be present.
