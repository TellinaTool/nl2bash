NAME
       unpack200 - JAR Unpacking tool

SYNOPSIS
       unpack200 [ OPTIONS ] input-file JAR-file

PARAMETERS
       The  options  may  be in any order. The last option on the command line
       supersedes all previously specified options.  For a discussion  of  the
       options, see OPTIONS below.

       input-file
              name  of  the  input file, which can be a pack200 gzip file or a
              pack200 file. The input could  also  be  JAR  file  produced  by
              pack200(1)  with  an  effort of 0. In this case, the contents of
              the input file will be copied to the output JAR file,  with  the
              Pack200 marker.

       JAR-file
              name of the output JAR file.

DESCRIPTION
       The  unpack200 tool is a native implementation that transforms a packed
       file produced by pack200(1) into a JAR file.

       Typical usage:

              % unpack200 myarchive.pack.gz myarchive.jar

       In this example, the myarchive.jar is produced  from  myarchive.pack.gz
       using the default unpack200 settings.

OPTIONS
       -Hvalue --deflate-hint=value
              Sets  the  deflation  to  be true, false, or keep on all entries
              within a JAR file.  The default mode is keep. If true or  false,
              overrides  the  default  behavior and sets the deflation mode on
              all entries within the output JAR file.

Non-Standard Options
       -r --remove-pack-file
              Removes the input packed-file.

       -v --verbose
              Outputs minimal messages, multiple specification of this  option
              will output more verbose messages.

       -q --quiet
              Specifies quiet operation with no messages.

       -lfilename --log-file=filename
              Specifies a log file to output messages.

EXIT STATUS
       The following exit values are returned:

       0  Successful completion.

       >0  An error occurred.
