NAME
       dapptrace - trace user and library function usage. Uses DTrace.

SYNOPSIS
       dapptrace [-acdeFlhoU] [-u lib] { -p PID | command }

DESCRIPTION
       dapptrace prints details on user and library function calls. By default
       it traces user functions only, options can be  used  to  trace  library
       activity.

       Of particular interest is the elapsed times and on cpu times, which can
       identify both function calls that are slow to complete, and those which
       are consuming CPU cycles.

       Since  this  uses  DTrace, only users with root privileges can run this
       command.

OPTIONS
       -a     print all details

       -b bufsize
              dynamic variable  buffer  size.  Increase  this  if  you  notice
              dynamic  variable  drop  errors.  The  default  is  "4m"  for  4
              megabytes per CPU.

       -c     print function call counts

       -d     print relative timestamps, us

       -e     print elapsed times, us

       -F     print flow indentation

       -l     force printing of pid/lwpid per line

       -o     print on-cpu times, us

       -p PID examine this PID

       -u lib trace this library instead

       -U     trace all library and user functions


EXAMPLES
       run and examine the "df -h" command,
              # dapptrace df -h


       examine PID 1871,
              # dapptrace -p 1871


       print using flow indents,
              # dapptrace -Fp 1871


       print elapsed and CPU times,
              # dapptrace -eop 1871


FIELDS
       PID/LWPID
              Process ID / Lightweight Process ID

       RELATIVE
              relative timestamps to the start of the  thread,  us  (microsec-
              onds)

       ELAPSD elapsed time for this system call, us

       CPU    on-cpu time for this system call, us

       CALL(args)
              function call name, with some arguments in hexadecimal


DOCUMENTATION
       See  the  DTraceToolkit for further documentation under the Docs direc-
       tory. The DTraceToolkit docs may include full worked examples with ver-
       bose descriptions explaining the output.

EXIT
       dapptrace  will  run  forever  until Ctrl-C is hit, or if a command was
       executed dapptrace will finish when the command ends.
