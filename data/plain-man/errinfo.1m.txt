NAME
       errinfo - print errno for syscall fails. Uses DTrace.

SYNOPSIS
       errinfo [-a|-A|-hsvZ] [-c command]

DESCRIPTION
       errinfo snoops syscall failures and prints the errno value and descrip-
       tion of the error number.

       This program can help determine if applications are  silently  failing,
       providing some details on the cause.

       Since  this  uses  DTrace, only users with root privileges can run this
       command.

              count of errors

              examine processes with ths name only (eg, "ls")

EXAMPLES

              # errinfo


       Print a frequency count report,
              # errinfo -c


       Snoop errors as they occur for "ssh" processes,
              # errinfo -n ssh PP

       Snoop errors for PID 81 only,
              # errinfo -p 81
