OSACOMPILE(1)             BSD General Commands Manual            OSACOMPILE(1)

NAME
     osacompile -- compile AppleScripts and other OSA language scripts

SYNOPSIS
     osacompile [-l language] [-e command] [-o name] [-d] [-r type:id]
                [-t type] [-c creator] [-x] [-s] [-u] [-a arch] [file ...]

DESCRIPTION
     osacompile compiles the given files, or standard input if none are
     listed, into a single output script.  Files may be plain text or other
     compiled scripts.  The options are as follows:

     -l language
           Override the language for any plain text files.  Normally, plain
           text files are compiled as AppleScript.

     -e command
           Enter one line of a script.  Script commands given via -e are
           prepended to the normal source, if any.  Multiple -e options may be
           given to build up a multi-line script.  Because most scripts use
           characters that are special to many shell programs (e.g., Apple-
           Script uses single and double quote marks, ``('', ``)'', and
           ``*''), the command will have to be correctly quoted and escaped to
           get it past the shell intact.

     -o name
           Place the output in the file name.  If -o is not specified, the
           resulting script is placed in the file ``a.scpt''.  The value of -o
           partly determines the output file format; see below.

     -x    Save the resulting script as execute-only.

     The following options are only relevant when creating a new bundled
     applet or droplet:

     -s    Stay-open applet.

     -u    Use startup screen.

     -a arch
           Create the applet or droplet for the specified target architecture
           arch.  The allowable values are ``ppc'', ``i386'', and ``x86_64''.
           The default is to create a universal binary.

     The following options control the packaging of the output file.  You
     should only need them for compatibility with classic Mac OS or for custom
     file formats.

     -d    Place the resulting script in the data fork of the output file.
           This is the default.

     -r type:id
           Place the resulting script in the resource fork of the output file,
           in the specified resource.

     -t type
           Set the output file type to type, where type is a four-character
           code.  If this option is not specified, the creator code will not
           be set.

     -c creator
           Set the output file creator to creator, where creator is a four-
           character code.  If this option is not specified, the creator code
           will not be set.

     If no options are specified, osacompile produces a Mac OS X format script
     file: data fork only, with no type or creator code.

     If the -o option is specified and the file does not already exist,
     osacompile uses the filename extension to determine what type of file to
     create.  If the filename ends with ``.app'', it creates a bundled applet
     or droplet.  If the filename ends with ``.scptd'', it creates a bundled
     compiled script.  Otherwise, it creates a flat file with the script data
     placed according to the values of the -d and -r options.

EXAMPLES
     To produce a script compatible with classic Mac OS:

           osacompile -r scpt:128 -t osas -c ToyS example.applescript
