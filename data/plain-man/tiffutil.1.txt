NAME
     tiffutil - manipulates tiff files

SYNOPSIS
     tiffutil <option> [<arguments>] [-out <outfile>]

DESCRIPTION
     tiffutil lets you manipulate TIFF files. The list of options (also avail-
     able by running the program without any options) follows:

     tiffutil -none             infile                  [-out outfile]
              -lzw              infile                  [-out outfile]
              -packbits         infile                  [-out outfile]
              -cat              infile1 [infile2 ...]   [-out outfile]
              -catnosizecheck   infile1 [infile2 ...]   [-out outfile]
              -cathidpicheck    infile1 [infile2 ...]   [-out outfile]
              -extract          num infile              [-out outfile]
              -info             infile
              -verboseinfo      infile
              -dump             infile

     -none, -lzw, and -packbits options specify the compression format to be
     applied to the images in the TIFF file.  -none specifies no compression;
     -packbits specifies PackBits compression; -lzw specifies standard Lempel-
     Ziv & Welch compression (no prediction scheme).

     -cat allows combining multiple TIFF files into one.  The images are
     copied without any change in tag values. If the real sizes (pixel size
     divided by dpi) of the images being combined are not the same, a warning
     will be generated. This makes sure that NSImage can successfully choose
     the right size image out of the generated TIFF file. Use -catnosizecheck
     to bypass the size check.

     -cathidpicheck can be used to write an output file conforming to Apple's
     guidelines for resolution independent bitmap images, and will generate
     warnings if the supplied images do not have the recommended size rela-
     tionship. For best results, ensure that the larger file has a filename of
     the form <basename>@2x.png.

     -extract allows extracting an individual image from a TIFF file; specify
     num = 0 for the first image in the file.

     -info prints information about TIFF images. -verboseinfo is the same,
     except most of the tables are displayed in full. -dump simply lists all
     of the tags in the file without trying to interpret them; it is handy
     when trying to figure out why a TIFF file won't load or display properly.

     For options which write images out, the output goes to "out.tiff" unless
     an output file name is specified after a -out keyword.  This keyword and
     the file must be the last items on the command line. -info, -verboseinfo,
     and -dump write their output to the standard output.

     If there are multiple images in a TIFF file the specified operation will
     be performed on all of them.

     SECURITY NOTE: This version of tiffutil SHOULD NOT be used with untrusted
     files.
