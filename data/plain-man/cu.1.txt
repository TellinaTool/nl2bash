NAME
       cu - Call up another system

SYNOPSIS
       cu [ options ] [ system | phone | "dir" ]

DESCRIPTION
       The  cu  command is used to call up another system and act as a dial in
       terminal.  It can also do simple file transfers with no error checking.

       cu  takes  a  single argument, besides the options.  If the argument is
       the string "dir" cu will make a direct connection to  the  port.   This
       may  only be used by users with write access to the port, as it permits
       reprogramming the modem.

       Otherwise, if the argument begins with a digit, it is  taken  to  be  a
       phone  number to call.  Otherwise, it is taken to be the name of a sys-
       tem to call.  The -z or --system option may be used to  name  a  system
       beginning  with  a  digit,  and the -c or --phone option may be used to
       name a phone number that does not begin with a digit.

       cu locates a port to use in the UUCP configuration files.  If a  simple
       system  name  is given, it will select a port appropriate for that sys-
       tem.  The -p, --port, -l, --line, -s and --speed options may be used to
       control the port selection.

       When  a connection is made to the remote system, cu forks into two pro-
       cesses.  One reads from the port and writes to the terminal, while  the
       other reads from the terminal and writes to the port.

       cu  provides several commands that may be used during the conversation.
       The commands all begin with an escape character, initially  ~  (tilde).
       The escape character is only recognized at the beginning of a line.  To
       send an escape character to the remote system at the start of  a  line,
       it  must  be entered twice.  All commands are either a single character
       or a word beginning with % (percent sign).

       cu recognizes the following commands:


       ~.   Terminate the conversation.

       ~! command
            Run command in a shell.  If command is empty, starts up a shell.

       ~$ command
            Run command, sending the standard output to the remote system.

       ~| command
            Run command, taking the standard input from the remote system.

       ~+ command
            Run command, taking the standard input from the remote system  and
            sending the standard output to the remote system.

       ~#, ~%break
            Send a break signal, if possible.

       ~c directory, ~%cd directory
            Change the local directory.

       ~> file
            Send  a  file to the remote system.  This just dumps the file over
            the communication line.  It is assumed that the remote  system  is
            expecting it.

       ~<   Receive a file from the remote system.  This prompts for the local
            file name and for the remote command to execute to begin the  file
            transfer.   It  continues accepting data until the contents of the
            eofread variable are seen.

       ~p from to, ~%put from to
            Send a file to a remote Unix system.  This  runs  the  appropriate
            commands on the remote system.

       ~t from to, ~%take from to
            Retrieve  a  file from a remote Unix system.  This runs the appro-
            priate commands on the remote system.

       ~s variable value
            Set a cu variable to the given value.  If value is not given,  the
            variable is set to true.

       ~! variable
            Set a cu variable to false.

       ~z   Suspend  the  cu session.  This is only supported on some systems.
            On systems for which ^Z may be used to suspend  a  job,  ~^Z  will
            also suspend the session.

       ~%nostop
            Turn off XON/XOFF handling.

       ~%stop
            Turn on XON/XOFF handling.

       ~v   List all the variables and their values.

       ~?   List all commands.

            cu  also  supports several variables.  They may be listed with the
            ~v command, and set with the ~s or ~!  commands.


       escape
            The escape character.  Initially ~ (tilde).

       delay
            If this variable is true, cu will delay for a second after  recog-
            nizing  the escape character before printing the name of the local
            system.  The default is true.

       eol  The list of characters which are considered to finish a line.  The
            escape  character  is  only recognized after one of these is seen.
            The default is carriage return, ^U, ^C, ^O, ^D, ^S, ^Q, ^R.

       binary
            Whether to transfer binary data when sending a file.  If  this  is
            false,  then newlines in the file being sent are converted to car-
            riage returns.  The default is false.

       binary-prefix
            A string used before sending a binary character in a  file  trans-
            fer, if the binary variable is true.  The default is ^V.

       echo-check
            Whether  to check file transfers by examining what the remote sys-
            tem echoes back.  This  probably  doesn't  work  very  well.   The
            default is false.

       echonl
            The  character to look for after sending each line in a file.  The
            default is carriage return.

       timeout
            The timeout to use, in seconds,  when  looking  for  a  character,
            either  when  doing  echo  checking or when looking for the echonl
            character.  The default is 30.

       kill The character to use delete a line if the echo check  fails.   The
            default is ^U.

       resend
            The  number  of times to resend a line if the echo check continues
            to fail.  The default is 10.

       eofwrite
            The string to write after sending a file with the ~> command.  The
            default is ^D.

       eofread
            The  string to look for when receiving a file with the ~< command.
            The default is $, which is intended to be a typical shell  prompt.

       verbose
            Whether  to  print accumulated information during a file transfer.
            The default is true.

OPTIONS
       The following options may be given to cu.

       -e, --parity=even
            Use even parity.

       -o, --parity=odd
            Use odd parity.

       --parity=none
            Use no parity.  No parity is also used  if  both  -e  and  -o  are
            given.

       -h, --halfduplex
            Echo characters locally (half-duplex mode).

       --nostop
            Turn off XON/XOFF handling (it is on by default).

       -E char, --escape char
            Set  the escape character.  Initially ~ (tilde).  To eliminate the
            escape character, use -E ''.

       -z system, --system system
            The system to call.

       -c phone-number, --phone phone-number
            The phone number to call.

       -p port, --port port
            Name the port to use.

       -a port
            Equivalent to --port port.

       -l line, --line line
            Name the line to use by giving a device name.  This may be used to
            dial  out  on  ports that are not listed in the UUCP configuration
            files.  Write access to the device is required.

       -s speed, --speed speed
            The speed (baud rate) to use.

       -#   Where # is a number, equivalent to --speed #.

       -n, --prompt
            Prompt for the phone number to use.

       -d   Enter debugging mode.  Equivalent to --debug all.

       -x type, --debug type
            Turn on particular debugging types.  The following types are  rec-
            ognized:  abnormal, chat, handshake, uucp-proto, proto, port, con-
            fig, spooldir, execute, incoming, outgoing.  Only abnormal,  chat,
            handshake,  port, config, incoming and outgoing are meaningful for
            cu.

            Multiple types may be given, separated by commas, and the  --debug
            option  may  appear  multiple  times.  A number may also be given,
            which will turn on that many types from the  foregoing  list;  for
            example,   --debug  2  is  equivalent  to  --debug  abnormal,chat.
            --debug all may be used to turn on all debugging options.

       -I file, --config file
            Set configuration file to use.  This option may not be  available,
            depending upon how cu was compiled.

       -v, --version
            Report version information and exit.

       --help
            Print a help message and exit.

BUGS
       This program does not work very well.
