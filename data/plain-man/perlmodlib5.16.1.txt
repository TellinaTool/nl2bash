NAME
       perlmodlib - constructing new Perl modules and finding existing ones

THE PERL MODULE LIBRARY
       Many modules are included in the Perl distribution.  These are
       described below, and all end in .pm.  You may discover compiled library
       files (usually ending in .so) or small pieces of modules to be
       autoloaded (ending in .al); these were automatically generated by the
       installation process.  You may also discover files in the library
       directory that end in either .pl or .ph.  These are old libraries
       supplied so that old programs that use them still run.  The .pl files
       will all eventually be converted into standard modules, and the .ph
       files made by h2ph will probably end up as extension modules made by
       h2xs.  (Some .ph values may already be available through the POSIX,
       Errno, or Fcntl modules.)  The pl2pm file in the distribution may help
       in your conversion, but it's just a mechanical process and therefore
       far from bulletproof.

   Pragmatic Modules
       They work somewhat like compiler directives (pragmata) in that they
       tend to affect the compilation of your program, and thus will usually
       work well only when used within a "use", or "no".  Most of these are
       lexically scoped, so an inner BLOCK may countermand them by saying:

           no integer;
           no strict 'refs';
           no warnings;

       which lasts until the end of that BLOCK.

       Some pragmas are lexically scoped--typically those that affect the $^H
       hints variable.  Others affect the current package instead, like "use
       vars" and "use subs", which allow you to predeclare a variables or
       subroutines within a particular file rather than just a block.  Such
       declarations are effective for the entire file for which they were
       declared.  You cannot rescind them with "no vars" or "no subs".

       The following pragmas are defined (and have their own documentation).

       Standard, bundled modules are all expected to behave in a well-defined
       manner with respect to namespace pollution because they use the
       Exporter module.  See their own documentation for details.

       version::Internals
                   Perl extension for Version Objects

       To find out all modules installed on your system, including those
       without documentation or outside the standard release, just use the
       following command (under the default win32 shell, double quotes should
       be used instead of single quotes).

           % perl -MFile::Find=find -MFile::Spec::Functions -Tlwe \
             'find { wanted => sub { print canonpath $_ if /\.pm\z/ },
             no_chdir => 1 }, @INC'

       (The -T is here to prevent '.' from being listed in @INC.)  They should
       all have their own documentation installed and accessible via your
       system man(1) command.  If you do not have a find program, you can use
       the Perl find2perl program instead, which generates Perl code as output
       you can run through perl.  If you have a man program but it doesn't
       find your modules, you'll have to fix your manpath.  See perl for
       details.  If you have no system man command, you might try the perldoc
       program.

       Note also that the command "perldoc perllocal" gives you a (possibly
       incomplete) list of the modules that have been further installed on
       your system. (The perllocal.pod file is updated by the standard
       MakeMaker install process.)

   Extension Modules
       Extension modules are written in C (or a mix of Perl and C).  They are
       usually dynamically loaded into Perl if and when you need them, but may
       also be linked in statically.  Supported extension modules include
       Socket, Fcntl, and POSIX.

       Many popular C extension modules do not come bundled (at least, not
       completely) due to their sizes, volatility, or simply lack of time for
       adequate testing and configuration across the multitude of platforms on
       which Perl was beta-tested.  You are encouraged to look for them on
       CPAN (described below), or using web search engines like Alta Vista or
       Google.

CPAN
       CPAN stands for Comprehensive Perl Archive Network; it's a globally
       replicated trove of Perl materials, including documentation, style
       guides, tricks and traps, alternate ports to non-Unix systems and
       occasional binary distributions for these.   Search engines for CPAN
       can be found at http://www.cpan.org/

       Most importantly, CPAN includes around a thousand unbundled modules,
       some of which require a C compiler to build.  Major categories of
       modules are:

       o   Language Extensions and Documentation Tools

       o   Development Support

       o   Operating System Interfaces

       o   Networking, Device Control (modems) and InterProcess Communication

       o   Data Types and Data Type Utilities

       o   Database Interfaces

       o   User Interfaces

       o   Interfaces to / Emulations of Other Programming Languages

       o   File Names, File Systems and File Locking (see also File Handles)

       o   String Processing, Language Text Processing, Parsing, and Searching

       o   Option, Argument, Parameter, and Configuration File Processing

       o   Internationalization and Locale

       o   Authentication, Security, and Encryption

       o   World Wide Web, HTML, HTTP, CGI, MIME

       o   Server and Daemon Utilities

       o   Archiving and Compression

       o   Images, Pixmap and Bitmap Manipulation, Drawing, and Graphing

       o   Mail and Usenet News

       o   Control Flow Utilities (callbacks and exceptions etc)

       o   File Handle and Input/Output Stream Utilities

       o   Miscellaneous Modules

       The list of the registered CPAN sites follows.  Please note that the
       sorting order is alphabetical on fields:

       Continent
          |
          |-->Country
                |
                |-->[state/province]
                          |
                          |-->ftp
                          |
                          |-->[http]

       and thus the North American servers happen to be listed between the
       European and the South American sites.

Modules: Creation, Use, and Abuse
       (The following section is borrowed directly from Tim Bunce's modules
       file, available at your nearest CPAN site.)

       Perl implements a class using a package, but the presence of a package
       doesn't imply the presence of a class.  A package is just a namespace.
       A class is a package that provides subroutines that can be used as
       methods.  A method is just a subroutine that expects, as its first
       argument, either the name of a package (for "static" methods), or a
       reference to something (for "virtual" methods).

       A module is a file that (by convention) provides a class of the same
       name (sans the .pm), plus an import method in that class that can be
       called to fetch exported symbols.  This module may implement some of
       its methods by loading dynamic C or C++ objects, but that should be
       totally transparent to the user of the module.  Likewise, the module
       might set up an AUTOLOAD function to slurp in subroutine definitions on
       demand, but this is also transparent.  Only the .pm file is required to
       exist.  See perlsub, perlobj, and AutoLoader for details about the
       AUTOLOAD mechanism.

   Guidelines for Module Creation
       o   Do similar modules already exist in some form?

           If so, please try to reuse the existing modules either in whole or
           by inheriting useful features into a new class.  If this is not
           practical try to get together with the module authors to work on
           extending or enhancing the functionality of the existing modules.
           A perfect example is the plethora of packages in perl4 for dealing
           with command line options.

           If you are writing a module to expand an already existing set of
           modules, please coordinate with the author of the package.  It
           helps if you follow the same naming scheme and module interaction
           scheme as the original author.

       o   Try to design the new module to be easy to extend and reuse.

           Try to "use warnings;" (or "use warnings qw(...);").  Remember that
           you can add "no warnings qw(...);" to individual blocks of code
           that need less warnings.

           Use blessed references.  Use the two argument form of bless to
           bless into the class name given as the first parameter of the
           constructor, e.g.,:

            sub new {
                my $class = shift;
                return bless {}, $class;
            }

           or even this if you'd like it to be used as either a static or a
           virtual method.

            sub new {
                my $self  = shift;
                my $class = ref($self) || $self;
                return bless {}, $class;
            }

           Pass arrays as references so more parameters can be added later
           (it's also faster).  Convert functions into methods where
           appropriate.  Split large methods into smaller more flexible ones.
           Inherit methods from other modules if appropriate.

           Avoid class name tests like: "die "Invalid" unless ref $ref eq
           'FOO'".  Generally you can delete the "eq 'FOO'" part with no harm
           at all.  Let the objects look after themselves! Generally, avoid
           hard-wired class names as far as possible.

           Avoid "$r->Class::func()" where using "@ISA=qw(... Class ...)" and
           "$r->func()" would work.

           Use autosplit so little used or newly added functions won't be a
           burden to programs that don't use them. Add test functions to the
           module after __END__ either using AutoSplit or by saying:

            eval join('',<main::DATA>) || die $@ unless caller();

           Does your module pass the 'empty subclass' test? If you say
           "@SUBCLASS::ISA = qw(YOURCLASS);" your applications should be able
           to use SUBCLASS in exactly the same way as YOURCLASS.  For example,
           does your application still work if you change:  "$obj =
           YOURCLASS->new();" into: "$obj = SUBCLASS->new();" ?

           Avoid keeping any state information in your packages. It makes it
           difficult for multiple other packages to use yours. Keep state
           information in objects.

           Always use -w.

           Try to "use strict;" (or "use strict qw(...);").  Remember that you
           can add "no strict qw(...);" to individual blocks of code that need
           less strictness.

           Always use -w.

           Follow the guidelines in perlstyle.

           Always use -w.

       o   Some simple style guidelines

           The perlstyle manual supplied with Perl has many helpful points.

           Coding style is a matter of personal taste. Many people evolve
           their style over several years as they learn what helps them write
           and maintain good code.  Here's one set of assorted suggestions
           that seem to be widely used by experienced developers:

           Use underscores to separate words.  It is generally easier to read
           $var_names_like_this than $VarNamesLikeThis, especially for non-
           native speakers of English. It's also a simple rule that works
           consistently with VAR_NAMES_LIKE_THIS.

           Package/Module names are an exception to this rule. Perl informally
           reserves lowercase module names for 'pragma' modules like integer
           and strict. Other modules normally begin with a capital letter and
           use mixed case with no underscores (need to be short and portable).

           You may find it helpful to use letter case to indicate the scope or
           nature of a variable. For example:

            $ALL_CAPS_HERE   constants only (beware clashes with Perl vars)
            $Some_Caps_Here  package-wide global/static
            $no_caps_here    function scope my() or local() variables

           Function and method names seem to work best as all lowercase.
           e.g., "$obj->as_string()".

           You can use a leading underscore to indicate that a variable or
           function should not be used outside the package that defined it.

       o   Select what to export.

           Do NOT export method names!

           Do NOT export anything else by default without a good reason!

           Exports pollute the namespace of the module user.  If you must
           export try to use @EXPORT_OK in preference to @EXPORT and avoid
           short or common names to reduce the risk of name clashes.

           Generally anything not exported is still accessible from outside
           the module using the ModuleName::item_name (or
           "$blessed_ref->method") syntax.  By convention you can use a
           leading underscore on names to indicate informally that they are
           'internal' and not for public use.

           (It is actually possible to get private functions by saying: "my
           $subref = sub { ... };  &$subref;".  But there's no way to call
           that directly as a method, because a method must have a name in the
           symbol table.)

           As a general rule, if the module is trying to be object oriented
           then export nothing. If it's just a collection of functions then
           @EXPORT_OK anything but use @EXPORT with caution.

       o   Select a name for the module.

           This name should be as descriptive, accurate, and complete as
           possible.  Avoid any risk of ambiguity. Always try to use two or
           more whole words.  Generally the name should reflect what is
           special about what the module does rather than how it does it.
           Please use nested module names to group informally or categorize a
           module.  There should be a very good reason for a module not to
           have a nested name.  Module names should begin with a capital
           letter.

           Having 57 modules all called Sort will not make life easy for
           anyone (though having 23 called Sort::Quick is only marginally
           better :-).  Imagine someone trying to install your module
           alongside many others.  If in any doubt ask for suggestions in
           comp.lang.perl.misc.

           If you are developing a suite of related modules/classes it's good
           practice to use nested classes with a common prefix as this will
           avoid namespace clashes. For example: Xyz::Control, Xyz::View,
           Xyz::Model etc. Use the modules in this list as a naming guide.

           If adding a new module to a set, follow the original author's
           standards for naming modules and the interface to methods in those
           modules.

           If developing modules for private internal or project specific use,
           that will never be released to the public, then you should ensure
           that their names will not clash with any future public module. You
           can do this either by using the reserved Local::* category or by
           using a category name that includes an underscore like Foo_Corp::*.

           To be portable each component of a module name should be limited to
           11 characters. If it might be used on MS-DOS then try to ensure
           each is unique in the first 8 characters. Nested modules make this
           easier.

       o   Have you got it right?

           How do you know that you've made the right decisions? Have you
           picked an interface design that will cause problems later? Have you
           picked the most appropriate name? Do you have any questions?

           The best way to know for sure, and pick up many helpful
           suggestions, is to ask someone who knows. Comp.lang.perl.misc is
           read by just about all the people who develop modules and it's the
           best place to ask.

           All you need to do is post a short summary of the module, its
           purpose and interfaces. A few lines on each of the main methods is
           probably enough. (If you post the whole module it might be ignored
           by busy people - generally the very people you want to read it!)

           Don't worry about posting if you can't say when the module will be
           ready - just say so in the message. It might be worth inviting
           others to help you, they may be able to complete it for you!

       o   README and other Additional Files.

           It's well known that software developers usually fully document the
           software they write. If, however, the world is in urgent need of
           your software and there is not enough time to write the full
           documentation please at least provide a README file containing:

           o         A description of the module/package/extension etc.

           o         A copyright notice - see below.

           o         Prerequisites - what else you may need to have.

           o         How to build it - possible changes to Makefile.PL etc.

           o         How to install it.

           o         Recent changes in this release, especially
                     incompatibilities

           o         Changes / enhancements you plan to make in the future.

           If the README file seems to be getting too large you may wish to
           split out some of the sections into separate files: INSTALL,
           Copying, ToDo etc.

           o   Adding a Copyright Notice.

               How you choose to license your work is a personal decision.
               The general mechanism is to assert your Copyright and then make
               a declaration of how others may copy/use/modify your work.

               Perl, for example, is supplied with two types of licence: The
               GNU GPL and The Artistic Licence (see the files README,
               Copying, and Artistic, or perlgpl and perlartistic).  Larry has
               good reasons for NOT just using the GNU GPL.

               My personal recommendation, out of respect for Larry, Perl, and
               the Perl community at large is to state something simply like:

                Copyright (c) 1995 Your Name. All rights reserved.
                This program is free software; you can redistribute it and/or
                modify it under the same terms as Perl itself.

               This statement should at least appear in the README file. You
               may also wish to include it in a Copying file and your source
               files.  Remember to include the other words in addition to the
               Copyright.

           o   Give the module a version/issue/release number.

               To be fully compatible with the Exporter and MakeMaker modules
               you should store your module's version number in a non-my
               package variable called $VERSION.  This should be a positive
               floating point number with at least two digits after the
               decimal (i.e., hundredths, e.g, "$VERSION = "0.01"").  Don't
               use a "1.3.2" style version.  See Exporter for details.

               It may be handy to add a function or method to retrieve the
               number.  Use the number in announcements and archive file names
               when releasing the module (ModuleName-1.02.tar.Z).  See perldoc
               ExtUtils::MakeMaker.pm for details.

           o   How to release and distribute a module.

               It's good idea to post an announcement of the availability of
               your module (or the module itself if small) to the
               comp.lang.perl.announce Usenet newsgroup.  This will at least
               ensure very wide once-off distribution.

               If possible, register the module with CPAN.  You should include
               details of its location in your announcement.

               Some notes about ftp archives: Please use a long descriptive
               file name that includes the version number. Most incoming
               directories will not be readable/listable, i.e., you won't be
               able to see your file after uploading it. Remember to send your
               email notification message as soon as possible after uploading
               else your file may get deleted automatically. Allow time for
               the file to be processed and/or check the file has been
               processed before announcing its location.

               FTP Archives for Perl Modules:

               Follow the instructions and links on:

                  http://www.cpan.org/modules/00modlist.long.html
                  http://www.cpan.org/modules/04pause.html

               or upload to one of these sites:

                  https://pause.kbx.de/pause/
                  http://pause.perl.org/

               and notify <modules@perl.org>.

               By using the WWW interface you can ask the Upload Server to
               mirror your modules from your ftp or WWW site into your own
               directory on CPAN!

               Please remember to send me an updated entry for the Module
               list!

           o   Take care when changing a released module.

               Always strive to remain compatible with previous released
               versions.  Otherwise try to add a mechanism to revert to the
               old behavior if people rely on it.  Document incompatible
               changes.

   Guidelines for Converting Perl 4 Library Scripts into Modules
       o   There is no requirement to convert anything.

           If it ain't broke, don't fix it! Perl 4 library scripts should
           continue to work with no problems. You may need to make some minor
           changes (like escaping non-array @'s in double quoted strings) but
           there is no need to convert a .pl file into a Module for just that.

       o   Consider the implications.

           All Perl applications that make use of the script will need to be
           changed (slightly) if the script is converted into a module.  Is it
           worth it unless you plan to make other changes at the same time?

       o   Make the most of the opportunity.

           If you are going to convert the script to a module you can use the
           opportunity to redesign the interface.  The guidelines for module
           creation above include many of the issues you should consider.

       o   The pl2pm utility will get you started.

           This utility will read *.pl files (given as parameters) and write
           corresponding *.pm files. The pl2pm utilities does the following:

           o         Adds the standard Module prologue lines

           o         Converts package specifiers from ' to ::

           o         Converts die(...) to croak(...)

           o         Several other minor changes

           Being a mechanical process pl2pm is not bullet proof. The converted
           code will need careful checking, especially any package statements.
           Don't delete the original .pl file till the new .pm one works!

   Guidelines for Reusing Application Code
       o   Complete applications rarely belong in the Perl Module Library.

       o   Many applications contain some Perl code that could be reused.

           Help save the world! Share your code in a form that makes it easy
           to reuse.

       o   Break-out the reusable code into one or more separate module files.

       o   Take the opportunity to reconsider and redesign the interfaces.

       o   In some cases the 'application' can then be reduced to a small

           fragment of code built on top of the reusable modules. In these
           cases the application could invoked as:

                % perl -e 'use Module::Name; method(@ARGV)' ...
           or
                % perl -mModule::Name ...    (in perl5.002 or higher)

NOTE
       Perl does not enforce private and public parts of its modules as you
       may have been used to in other languages like C++, Ada, or Modula-17.
       Perl doesn't have an infatuation with enforced privacy.  It would
       prefer that you stayed out of its living room because you weren't
       invited, not because it has a shotgun.

       The module and its user have a contract, part of which is common law,
       and part of which is "written".  Part of the common law contract is
       that a module doesn't pollute any namespace it wasn't asked to.  The
       written contract for the module (A.K.A. documentation) may make other
       provisions.  But then you know when you "use RedefineTheWorld" that
       you're redefining the world and willing to take the consequences.
