NAME
       ldapcompare - LDAP compare tool

SYNOPSIS
       ldapcompare  [-n]  [-v]  [-z]  [-M[M]] [-d debuglevel] [-D binddn] [-W]
       [-w passwd] [-y passwdfile]  [-H ldapuri]  [-h ldaphost]  [-p ldapport]
       [-P {2|3}]  [-e [!]ext[=extparam]] [-E [!]ext[=extparam]] [-O security-
       properties]  [-I]  [-Q]  [-U authcid]  [-R realm]   [-x]   [-X authzid]
       [-Y mech] [-Z[Z]] DN {attr:value | attr::b64value}

DESCRIPTION
       ldapcompare  is a shell-accessible interface to the ldap_compare_ext(3)
       library call.

       ldapcompare opens a connection to an LDAP server, binds, and performs a
       compare  using specified parameters.   The DN should be a distinguished
       name in the directory.  Attr should be a known attribute.  If  followed
       by  one  colon, the assertion value should be provided as a string.  If
       followed by two colons, the base64 encoding of the value  is  provided.
       The result code of the compare is provided as the exit code and, unless
       ran with -z, the program prints TRUE, FALSE, or UNDEFINED  on  standard
       output.


OPTIONS
       -n     Show what would be done, but don't actually perform the compare.
              Useful for debugging in conjunction with -v.

       -v     Run in verbose mode, with many diagnostics written  to  standard
              output.

       -z     Run  in  quiet  mode,  no output is written.  You must check the
              return status.  Useful in shell scripts.

       -M[M]  Enable manage DSA IT control.  -MM makes control critical.

       -d debuglevel
              Set the LDAP debugging level to debuglevel.  ldapcompare must be
              compiled  with  LDAP_DEBUG  defined  for this option to have any
              effect.

       -x     Use simple authentication instead of SASL.

       -D binddn
              Use the Distinguished Name binddn to bind to the LDAP directory.
              For SASL binds, the server is expected to ignore this value.

       -W     Prompt for simple authentication.  This is used instead of spec-
              ifying the password on the command line.

       -w passwd
              Use passwd as the password for simple authentication.

       -y passwdfile
              Use complete contents of passwdfile as the password  for  simple
              authentication.   Note  that  complete means that any leading or
              trailing whitespaces, including  newlines,  will  be  considered
              part  of  the password and, unlike other software, they will not
              be stripped.  As a consequence, passwords  stored  in  files  by
              commands like echo(1) will not behave as expected, since echo(1)
              by default appends a trailing newline to the echoed string.  The
              recommended portable way to store a cleartext password in a file
              for use with this option is to use slappasswd(8)  with  {CLEART-
              EXT} as hash and the option -n.

       -H ldapuri
              Specify  URI(s) referring to the ldap server(s); only the proto-
              col/host/port fields are allowed; a list of  URI,  separated  by
              whitespace or commas is expected.

       -h ldaphost
              Specify  an  alternate host on which the ldap server is running.
              Deprecated in favor of -H.

       -p ldapport
              Specify an alternate TCP port where the ldap server  is  listen-
              ing.  Deprecated in favor of -H.

       -P {2|3}
              Specify the LDAP protocol version to use.

       -e [!]ext[=extparam]

       -E [!]ext[=extparam]

              Specify  general  extensions  with -e and search extensions with
              -E.  '!' indicates criticality.

              General extensions:
                [!]assert=<filter>   (an RFC 4515 Filter)
                [!]authzid=<authzid> ("dn:<dn>" or "u:<user>")
                [!]manageDSAit
                [!]noop
                ppolicy
                [!]postread[=<attrs>]        (a comma-separated attribute list)
                [!]preread[=<attrs>] (a comma-separated attribute list)
                abandon, cancel (SIGINT sends abandon/cancel; not really controls)

              Search extensions:
                [!]domainScope                               (domain scope)
                [!]mv=<filter>                               (matched values filter)
                [!]pr=<size>[/prompt|noprompt]       (paged results/prompt)
                [!]sss=[-]<attr[:OID]>[/[-]<attr[:OID]>...]  (server side sorting)
                [!]subentries[=true|false]           (subentries)
                [!]sync=ro[/<cookie>]                        (LDAP Sync refreshOnly)
                        rp[/<cookie>][/<slimit>]     (LDAP Sync refreshAndPersist)

       -O security-properties
              Specify SASL security properties.

       -I     Enable SASL Interactive mode.  Always  prompt.   Default  is  to
              prompt only as needed.

       -Q     Enable SASL Quiet mode.  Never prompt.

       -U authcid
              Specify  the authentication ID for SASL bind. The form of the ID
              depends on the actual SASL mechanism used.

       -R realm
              Specify the realm of authentication ID for SASL bind.  The  form
              of the realm depends on the actual SASL mechanism used.

       -X authzid
              Specify  the  requested authorization ID for SASL bind.  authzid
              must be one of the following formats: dn:<distinguished name> or
              u:<username>

       -Y mech
              Specify  the  SASL  mechanism  to be used for authentication. If
              it's not specified, the program will choose the  best  mechanism
              the server knows.

       -Z[Z]  Issue StartTLS (Transport Layer Security) extended operation. If
              you use -ZZ, the command will require the operation to  be  suc-
              cessful.

EXAMPLES
           ldapcompare "uid=babs,dc=example,dc=com"  sn:Jensen
           ldapcompare "uid=babs,dc=example,dc=com"  sn::SmVuc2Vu
       are all equivalent.

LIMITATIONS
       Requiring  the  value  be  passed  on  the command line is limiting and
       introduces some security concerns.  The command should support a mecha-
       nism to specify the location (file name or URL) to read the value from.
