SNMPSET(1)                         Net-SNMP                         SNMPSET(1)



NAME
       snmpset - communicates with a network entity using SNMP SET requests

SYNOPSIS
       snmpset [COMMON OPTIONS] AGENT OID TYPE VALUE [OID TYPE VALUE]...

DESCRIPTION
       snmpset  is  an  SNMP application that uses the SNMP SET request to set
       information on a network entity.  One or more object identifiers (OIDs)
       must  be given as arguments on the command line.  A type and a value to
       be set must accompany each object identifier.  Each  variable  name  is
       given in the format specified in variables(5).

       The TYPE is a single character, one of:
              i  INTEGER
              u  UNSIGNED
              s  STRING
              x  HEX STRING
              d  DECIMAL STRING
              n  NULLOBJ
              o  OBJID
              t  TIMETICKS
              a  IPADDRESS
              b  BITS
       Most of these will use the obvious corresponding ASN.1 type.  's', 'x',
       'd' and 'b' are all different ways of specifying an OCTET STRING value,
       and the 'u' unsigned type is also used for handling Gauge32 values.

       If you have the proper MIB file loaded, you can, in most cases, replace
       the type with an '=' sign. For an object of type OCTET STRING this will
       assume  a string like the 's' type notation. For other types it will do
       "The Right Thing".

       For example:

       snmpset -c private -v 1  test-hub  system.sysContact.0  s  dpz@noc.rut-
       gers.edu ip.ipforwarding.0 = 2

       will set the variables sysContact.0 and ipForwarding.0:

       system.sysContact.0 = STRING: "dpz@noc.rutgers.edu"
       ip.ipForwarding.0 = INTEGER: not-forwarding(2)

       If  the  network  entity has an error processing the request packet, an
       error packet will be returned and a message will be shown,  helping  to
       pinpoint in what way the request was malformed.

OPTIONS
       snmpset  takes  the  common  options described in the snmpcmd(1) manual
       page.  Note that snmpset REQUIRES  an argument specifying the agent  to
       query and at least one set of OID/type/value arguments, as described in
       there.

SEE ALSO
       snmpcmd(1), variables(5).
