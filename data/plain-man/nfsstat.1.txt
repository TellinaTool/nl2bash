NFSSTAT(1)                BSD General Commands Manual               NFSSTAT(1)

NAME
     nfsstat -- display NFS statistics

SYNOPSIS
     nfsstat [-cseuv] [-w wait] [-n net|user] [-m [mountpath]]

DESCRIPTION
     nfsstat displays statistics kept about NFS client and server activity,
     active user activity, exported directories, and mount information.  In
     the absence of any options, nfsstat displays NFS client and server sta-
     tistics.

     The options are as follows:

     -c      Show NFS client statistics.

     -e      Show NFS server exported directory statistics.

     -m [mountpath]
             Show NFS mount information.

     -s      Show NFS server statistics.

     -u      Show NFS server active user statistics.

     -w wait
             Display a shorter summary at wait second intervals.

     -n net|user
             Show network addresses as numbers, or show users as uid numbers.
             This option can appear multiple times.

     -v      Show additional information (if available).

OUTPUT
     The data fields that nfsstat displays for each set of statistics are:

     Client Information:
         Statistics for NFS file system mounts.

     Server Information:
         Statistics for the NFS server.

         RPC Counts
             Counts of RPC calls on each of the NFS server's procedures are

                  Calls already in progress.

             Idem
                  Cache hits for idempotent procedures.

             Non-idem
                  Cache hits for non-idempotent procedures.

             Misses
                  Cache Misses.

         Server Write Gathering
             These statistics describe the efficiency of the NFS server's
             write gathering feature.

             WriteOps
                  Write operations to disk.

             WriteRPC
