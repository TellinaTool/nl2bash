SNMPGET(1)                         Net-SNMP                         SNMPGET(1)



NAME
       snmpget - communicates with a network entity using SNMP GET requests

SYNOPSIS
       snmpget [COMMON OPTIONS] [-Cf] AGENT OID [OID]...

DESCRIPTION
       snmpget  is an SNMP application that uses the SNMP GET request to query
       for information on a network entity.  One or  more  object  identifiers
       (OIDs)  may  be  given as arguments on the command line.  Each variable
       name is given in the format specified in variables(5).

OPTIONS
       -Cf     If -Cf is not specified, some applications (snmpdelta, snmpget,
               snmpgetnext  and snmpstatus) will try to fix errors returned by
               the agent that you were talking to and resend the request.  The
               only  time this is really useful is if you specified a OID that
               didn't exist in your request  and  you're  using  SNMPv1  which
               requires "all or nothing" kinds of requests.

       In  addition to this option, snmpget takes the common options described
       in the snmpcmd(1) manual page.  Note that snmpget REQUIRES an  argument
       specifying  the  agent  to  query  and  at  least  one OID argument, as
       described there.

EXAMPLES
       The command:

           snmpget -c public zeus system.sysDescr.0

       will retrieve the variable system.sysDescr.0 from the host  zeus  using
       the community string public :

           system.sysDescr.0 = "SunOS zeus.net.cmu.edu 4.1.3_U1 1 sun4m"

       If  the  network  entity has an error processing the request packet, an
       error packet will be returned and a message will be shown,  helping  to
       pinpoint  in  what  way the request was malformed.  If there were other
       variables in the request, the request will be resent  without  the  bad
       variable.

       Here  is another example. The -c and -v options are defined in the snm-
       pcmd(1) manual page. (Note that system.sysUpTime is an incomplete  OID,
       as it needs the .0 index appended to it):

           snmpget -v1 -Cf -c public localhost system.sysUpTime system.sysContact.0

       This example will return the following:

           Error in packet
           Reason: (noSuchName) There is no such variable name in this MIB.
           This name doesn't exist: system.sysUpTime

       Similarly, the command:
           snmpget -v1 -c public localhost system.sysUpTime system.sysContact.0

       Will return:

           Error in packet
           Reason: (noSuchName) There is no such variable name in this MIB.
           This name doesn't exist: system.sysUpTime

           system.sysContact.0 = STRING: root@localhost

       With the -Cf flag specified the application will not try to fix the PDU
       for you.
