NAME
     ri -- Ruby API reference front end

SYNOPSIS
     ri [-Ti] [-d directory] [-f format] [--list-doc-dirs]
        [--no-standard-docs] [--[no-]{system|site|gems|home}]
        [--[no-]use-cache] [--width=width] [target ...]

DESCRIPTION
     ri is a CLI front end for the Ruby API reference.  You can search and
     read API reference for classes and methods with ri.

     ri is a part of Ruby.

     target can be one of the following forms:

           Class  for classes

           Class::method  for class methods

           Class#method  for instance methods

           Class.method  for both class and instance methods

           method  for both class and instance methods

     All class names may be abbreviated to their minimum unambiguous form. If
     a name is ambiguous, all valid options will be listed.

     For example:

           ri Fil
           ri File
           ri File.new
           ri zip

     Note that shell quoting may be required for method names containing punc-
     tuation:

           ri 'Array.[]'
           ri compact

OPTIONS
     --version      Prints the version of ri.

     -T
     --no-pager     Send output directly to stdout, rather than to a pager.

     -d directory
     --doc-dir=directory
                    List of directories from which to source documentation in
                    addition to the standard directories.  May be repeated.

     -f FORMAT
     --fmt FORMAT
     --format=FORMAT
                    Format to use when displaying output:

                    ansi, bs, html, plain, simple

                    Use 'bs' (backspace) with most pager programs. To use
                    ANSI, either disable the pager or tell the pager to allow
                    control characters.

     -i
     --interactive  This makes ri go into interactive mode.

                    When ri is in interactive mode it will allow the user to
                    disambiguate lists of methods in case multiple methods
                    match against a method search string.  It also will allow
                    the user to enter in a method name (with auto-completion,
                    if readline is supported) when viewing a class.

     --list-doc-dirs
                    List the directories from which ri will source documenta-
                    tion on stdout and exit.

     --no-standard-docs
                    Do not include documentation from the Ruby standard
                    library, site_lib, installed gems, or ~/.rdoc.

                    Equivalent to specifying the options --no-system,
                    --no-site, --no-gems, and --no-home.

     --[no-]system  Include documentation from Ruby's standard library.
                    Defaults to true.

     --[no-]site     Include documentation from libraries installed in
                    site_lib. Defaults to true.

     --[no-]gems    Include documentation from RubyGems. Defaults to true.

     --[no-]home    Include documentation stored in ~/.rdoc.  Defaults to
                    true.

     --[no-]use-cache
                    Whether or not to use ri's cache. True by default.

     -w width
     --width=width  Set the width of the output.
