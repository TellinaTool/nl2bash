NAME
       perlintern - autogenerated documentation of purely internal
       Perl functions

DESCRIPTION
       This file is the autogenerated documentation of functions in the Perl
       interpreter that are documented using Perl's internal documentation
       format but are not marked as part of the Perl API. In other words, they
       are not for use in extensions!

Compile-time scope hooks
       BhkENTRY
               Return an entry from the BHK structure. which is a preprocessor
               token indicating which entry to return. If the appropriate flag
               is not set this will return NULL. The type of the return value
               depends on which entry you ask for.

               NOTE: this function is experimental and may change or be
               removed without notice.

                       void *  BhkENTRY(BHK *hk, which)

       BhkFLAGS
               Return the BHK's flags.

               NOTE: this function is experimental and may change or be
               removed without notice.

                       U32     BhkFLAGS(BHK *hk)

       CALL_BLOCK_HOOKS
               Call all the registered block hooks for type which. which is a
               preprocessing token; the type of arg depends on which.

               NOTE: this function is experimental and may change or be
               removed without notice.

                       void    CALL_BLOCK_HOOKS(which, arg)

CV reference counts and CvOUTSIDE
       CvWEAKOUTSIDE
               Each CV has a pointer, "CvOUTSIDE()", to its lexically
               enclosing CV (if any). Because pointers to anonymous sub
               prototypes are stored in "&" pad slots, it is a possible to get
               a circular reference, with the parent pointing to the child and
               vice-versa. To avoid the ensuing memory leak, we do not
               increment the reference count of the CV pointed to by
               "CvOUTSIDE" in the one specific instance that the parent has a
               "&" pad slot pointing back to us. In this case, we set the
               "CvWEAKOUTSIDE" flag in the child. This allows us to determine
               under what circumstances we should decrement the refcount of
               the parent when freeing the child.

               There is a further complication with non-closure anonymous subs
               (i.e. those that do not refer to any lexicals outside that
               sub). In this case, the anonymous prototype is shared rather
               than being cloned. This has the consequence that the parent may
               be freed while there are still active children, eg

                   BEGIN { $a = sub { eval '$x' } }

               In this case, the BEGIN is freed immediately after execution
               since there are no active references to it: the anon sub
               prototype has "CvWEAKOUTSIDE" set since it's not a closure, and
               $a points to the same CV, so it doesn't contribute to BEGIN's
               refcount either.  When $a is executed, the "eval '$x'" causes
               the chain of "CvOUTSIDE"s to be followed, and the freed BEGIN
               is accessed.

               To avoid this, whenever a CV and its associated pad is freed,
               any "&" entries in the pad are explicitly removed from the pad,
               and if the refcount of the pointed-to anon sub is still
               positive, then that child's "CvOUTSIDE" is set to point to its
               grandparent. This will only occur in the single specific case
               of a non-closure anon prototype having one or more active
               references (such as $a above).

               One other thing to consider is that a CV may be merely
               undefined rather than freed, eg "undef &foo". In this case, its
               refcount may not have reached zero, but we still delete its pad
               and its "CvROOT" etc.  Since various children may still have
               their "CvOUTSIDE" pointing at this undefined CV, we keep its
               own "CvOUTSIDE" for the time being, so that the chain of
               lexical scopes is unbroken. For example, the following should
               print 123:

                   my $x = 123;
                   sub tmp { sub { eval '$x' } }
                   my $a = tmp();
                   undef &tmp;
                   print  $a->();

                       bool    CvWEAKOUTSIDE(CV *cv)

Embedding Functions
       cv_dump dump the contents of a CV

                       void    cv_dump(CV *cv, const char *title)

       cv_forget_slab
               When a CV has a reference count on its slab (CvSLABBED), it is
               responsible for making sure it is freed.  (Hence, no two CVs
               should ever have a reference count on the same slab.)  The CV
               only needs to reference the slab during compilation.  Once it
               is compiled and CvROOT attached, it has finished its job, so it
               can forget the slab.

                       void    cv_forget_slab(CV *cv)

       do_dump_pad
               Dump the contents of a padlist

                       void    do_dump_pad(I32 level, PerlIO *file,
                                           PADLIST *padlist, int full)

       intro_my
               "Introduce" my variables to visible status.  This is called
               during parsing at the end of each statement to make lexical
               variables visible to subsequent statements.

                       U32     intro_my()

       padlist_dup
               Duplicates a pad.

                       PADLIST * padlist_dup(PADLIST *srcpad,
                                             CLONE_PARAMS *param)

       pad_alloc_name
               Allocates a place in the currently-compiling pad (via
               "pad_alloc" in perlapi) and then stores a name for that entry.
               namesv is adopted and becomes the name entry; it must already
               contain the name string and be sufficiently upgraded.
               typestash and ourstash and the "padadd_STATE" flag get added to
               namesv.  None of the other processing of "pad_add_name_pvn" in
               perlapi is done.  Returns the offset of the allocated pad slot.

                       PADOFFSET pad_alloc_name(SV *namesv, U32 flags,
                                                HV *typestash, HV *ourstash)

       pad_block_start
               Update the pad compilation state variables on entry to a new
               block.

                       void    pad_block_start(int full)

       pad_check_dup
               Check for duplicate declarations: report any of:

                    * a my in the current scope with the same name;
                    * an our (anywhere in the pad) with the same name and the
                      same stash as C<ourstash>

               "is_our" indicates that the name to check is an 'our'
               declaration.

                       void    pad_check_dup(SV *name, U32 flags,
                                             const HV *ourstash)

       pad_findlex
               Find a named lexical anywhere in a chain of nested pads. Add
               fake entries in the inner pads if it's found in an outer one.

               Returns the offset in the bottom pad of the lex or the fake
               lex.  cv is the CV in which to start the search, and seq is the
               current cop_seq to match against. If warn is true, print
               appropriate warnings.  The out_* vars return values, and so are
               pointers to where the returned values should be stored.
               out_capture, if non-null, requests that the innermost instance
               of the lexical is captured; out_name_sv is set to the innermost
               matched namesv or fake namesv; out_flags returns the flags
               normally associated with the IVX field of a fake namesv.

               Note that pad_findlex() is recursive; it recurses up the chain
               of CVs, then comes back down, adding fake entries as it goes.
               It has to be this way because fake namesvs in anon protoypes
               have to store in xlow the index into the parent pad.

                       PADOFFSET pad_findlex(const char *namepv,
                                             STRLEN namelen, U32 flags,
                                             const CV* cv, U32 seq, int warn,
                                             SV** out_capture,
                                             SV** out_name_sv, int *out_flags)

       pad_fixup_inner_anons
               For any anon CVs in the pad, change CvOUTSIDE of that CV from
               old_cv to new_cv if necessary. Needed when a newly-compiled CV
               has to be moved to a pre-existing CV struct.

                       void    pad_fixup_inner_anons(PADLIST *padlist,
                                                     CV *old_cv, CV *new_cv)

       pad_free
               Free the SV at offset po in the current pad.

                       void    pad_free(PADOFFSET po)

       pad_leavemy
               Cleanup at end of scope during compilation: set the max seq
               number for lexicals in this scope and warn of any lexicals that
               never got introduced.

                       void    pad_leavemy()

       pad_push
               Push a new pad frame onto the padlist, unless there's already a
               pad at this depth, in which case don't bother creating a new
               one.  Then give the new pad an @_ in slot zero.

                       void    pad_push(PADLIST *padlist, int depth)

       pad_reset
               Mark all the current temporaries for reuse

                       void    pad_reset()

       pad_swipe
               Abandon the tmp in the current pad at offset po and replace
               with a new one.

                       void    pad_swipe(PADOFFSET po, bool refadjust)

Functions in file op.c
       core_prototype
               This function assigns the prototype of the named core function
               to "sv", or to a new mortal SV if "sv" is NULL.  It returns the
               modified "sv", or NULL if the core function has no prototype.
               "code" is a code as returned by "keyword()".  It must not be
               equal to 0 or -KEY_CORE.

                       SV *    core_prototype(SV *sv, const char *name,
                                              const int code,
                                              int * const opnum)

Functions in file pp_ctl.c
       docatch Check for the cases 0 or 3 of cur_env.je_ret, only used inside
               an eval context.

               0 is used as continue inside eval,

               3 is used for a die caught by an inner eval - continue inner
               loop

               See cop.h: je_mustcatch, when set at any runlevel to TRUE,
               means eval ops must establish a local jmpenv to handle
               exception traps.

                       OP*     docatch(OP *o)

GV Functions
       gv_try_downgrade
               If the typeglob "gv" can be expressed more succinctly, by
               having something other than a real GV in its place in the
               stash, replace it with the optimised form.  Basic requirements
               for this are that "gv" is a real typeglob, is sufficiently
               ordinary, and is only referenced from its package.  This
               function is meant to be used when a GV has been looked up in
               part to see what was there, causing upgrading, but based on
               what was found it turns out that the real GV isn't required
               after all.

               If "gv" is a completely empty typeglob, it is deleted from the
               stash.

               If "gv" is a typeglob containing only a sufficiently-ordinary
               constant sub, the typeglob is replaced with a scalar-reference
               placeholder that more compactly represents the same thing.

               NOTE: this function is experimental and may change or be
               removed without notice.

                       void    gv_try_downgrade(GV* gv)

Hash Manipulation Functions
       hv_ename_add
               Adds a name to a stash's internal list of effective names.  See
               "hv_ename_delete".

               This is called when a stash is assigned to a new location in
               the symbol table.

                       void    hv_ename_add(HV *hv, const char *name, U32 len,
                                            U32 flags)

       hv_ename_delete
               Removes a name from a stash's internal list of effective names.
               If this is the name returned by "HvENAME", then another name in
               the list will take its place ("HvENAME" will use it).

               This is called when a stash is deleted from the symbol table.

                       void    hv_ename_delete(HV *hv, const char *name,
                                               U32 len, U32 flags)

       refcounted_he_chain_2hv
               Generates and returns a "HV *" representing the content of a
               "refcounted_he" chain.  flags is currently unused and must be
               zero.

                       HV *    refcounted_he_chain_2hv(
                                   const struct refcounted_he *c, U32 flags
                               )

       refcounted_he_fetch_pv
               Like "refcounted_he_fetch_pvn", but takes a nul-terminated
               string instead of a string/length pair.

                       SV *    refcounted_he_fetch_pv(
                                   const struct refcounted_he *chain,
                                   const char *key, U32 hash, U32 flags
                               )

       refcounted_he_fetch_pvn
               Search along a "refcounted_he" chain for an entry with the key
               specified by keypv and keylen.  If flags has the
               "REFCOUNTED_HE_KEY_UTF8" bit set, the key octets are
               interpreted as UTF-8, otherwise they are interpreted as
               Latin-1.  hash is a precomputed hash of the key string, or zero
               if it has not been precomputed.  Returns a mortal scalar
               representing the value associated with the key, or
               &PL_sv_placeholder if there is no value associated with the
               key.

                       SV *    refcounted_he_fetch_pvn(
                                   const struct refcounted_he *chain,
                                   const char *keypv, STRLEN keylen, U32 hash,
                                   U32 flags
                               )

       refcounted_he_fetch_pvs
               Like "refcounted_he_fetch_pvn", but takes a literal string
               instead of a string/length pair, and no precomputed hash.

                       SV *    refcounted_he_fetch_pvs(
                                   const struct refcounted_he *chain,
                                   const char *key, U32 flags
                               )

       refcounted_he_fetch_sv
               Like "refcounted_he_fetch_pvn", but takes a Perl scalar instead
               of a string/length pair.

                       SV *    refcounted_he_fetch_sv(
                                   const struct refcounted_he *chain, SV *key,
                                   U32 hash, U32 flags
                               )

       refcounted_he_free
               Decrements the reference count of a "refcounted_he" by one.  If
               the reference count reaches zero the structure's memory is
               freed, which (recursively) causes a reduction of its parent
               "refcounted_he"'s reference count.  It is safe to pass a null
               pointer to this function: no action occurs in this case.

                       void    refcounted_he_free(struct refcounted_he *he)

       refcounted_he_inc
               Increment the reference count of a "refcounted_he".  The
               pointer to the "refcounted_he" is also returned.  It is safe to
               pass a null pointer to this function: no action occurs and a
               null pointer is returned.

                       struct refcounted_he * refcounted_he_inc(
                                                  struct refcounted_he *he
                                              )

       refcounted_he_new_pv
               Like "refcounted_he_new_pvn", but takes a nul-terminated string
               instead of a string/length pair.

                       struct refcounted_he * refcounted_he_new_pv(
                                                  struct refcounted_he *parent,
                                                  const char *key, U32 hash,
                                                  SV *value, U32 flags
                                              )

       refcounted_he_new_pvn
               Creates a new "refcounted_he".  This consists of a single
               key/value pair and a reference to an existing "refcounted_he"
               chain (which may be empty), and thus forms a longer chain.
               When using the longer chain, the new key/value pair takes
               precedence over any entry for the same key further along the
               chain.

               The new key is specified by keypv and keylen.  If flags has the
               "REFCOUNTED_HE_KEY_UTF8" bit set, the key octets are
               interpreted as UTF-8, otherwise they are interpreted as
               Latin-1.  hash is a precomputed hash of the key string, or zero
               if it has not been precomputed.

               value is the scalar value to store for this key.  value is
               copied by this function, which thus does not take ownership of
               any reference to it, and later changes to the scalar will not
               be reflected in the value visible in the "refcounted_he".
               Complex types of scalar will not be stored with referential
               integrity, but will be coerced to strings.  value may be either
               null or &PL_sv_placeholder to indicate that no value is to be
               associated with the key; this, as with any non-null value,
               takes precedence over the existence of a value for the key
               further along the chain.

               parent points to the rest of the "refcounted_he" chain to be
               attached to the new "refcounted_he".  This function takes
               ownership of one reference to parent, and returns one reference
               to the new "refcounted_he".

                       struct refcounted_he * refcounted_he_new_pvn(
                                                  struct refcounted_he *parent,
                                                  const char *keypv,
                                                  STRLEN keylen, U32 hash,
                                                  SV *value, U32 flags
                                              )

       refcounted_he_new_pvs
               Like "refcounted_he_new_pvn", but takes a literal string
               instead of a string/length pair, and no precomputed hash.

                       struct refcounted_he * refcounted_he_new_pvs(
                                                  struct refcounted_he *parent,
                                                  const char *key, SV *value,
                                                  U32 flags
                                              )

       refcounted_he_new_sv
               Like "refcounted_he_new_pvn", but takes a Perl scalar instead
               of a string/length pair.

                       struct refcounted_he * refcounted_he_new_sv(
                                                  struct refcounted_he *parent,
                                                  SV *key, U32 hash, SV *value,
                                                  U32 flags
                                              )

IO Functions
       start_glob
               Function called by "do_readline" to spawn a glob (or do the
               glob inside perl on VMS). This code used to be inline, but now
               perl uses "File::Glob" this glob starter is only used by
               miniperl during the build process.  Moving it away shrinks
               pp_hot.c; shrinking pp_hot.c helps speed perl up.

               NOTE: this function is experimental and may change or be
               removed without notice.

                       PerlIO* start_glob(SV *tmpglob, IO *io)

Magical Functions
       magic_clearhint
               Triggered by a delete from %^H, records the key to
               "PL_compiling.cop_hints_hash".

                       int     magic_clearhint(SV* sv, MAGIC* mg)

       magic_clearhints
               Triggered by clearing %^H, resets
               "PL_compiling.cop_hints_hash".

                       int     magic_clearhints(SV* sv, MAGIC* mg)

       magic_methcall
               Invoke a magic method (like FETCH).

               "sv" and "mg" are the tied thingy and the tie magic.

               "meth" is the name of the method to call.

               "argc" is the number of args (in addition to $self) to pass to
               the method.

               The "flags" can be:

                   G_DISCARD     invoke method with G_DISCARD flag and don't
                                 return a value
                   G_UNDEF_FILL  fill the stack with argc pointers to
                                 PL_sv_undef

               The arguments themselves are any values following the "flags"
               argument.

               Returns the SV (if any) returned by the method, or NULL on
               failure.

                       SV*     magic_methcall(SV *sv, const MAGIC *mg,
                                              const char *meth, U32 flags,
                                              U32 argc, ...)

       magic_sethint
               Triggered by a store to %^H, records the key/value pair to
               "PL_compiling.cop_hints_hash".  It is assumed that hints aren't
               storing anything that would need a deep copy.  Maybe we should
               warn if we find a reference.

                       int     magic_sethint(SV* sv, MAGIC* mg)

       mg_localize
               Copy some of the magic from an existing SV to new localized
               version of that SV. Container magic (eg %ENV, $1, tie) gets
               copied, value magic doesn't (eg taint, pos).

               If setmagic is false then no set magic will be called on the
               new (empty) SV.  This typically means that assignment will soon
               follow (e.g. 'local $x = $y'), and that will handle the magic.

                       void    mg_localize(SV* sv, SV* nsv, bool setmagic)

MRO Functions
       mro_get_linear_isa_dfs
               Returns the Depth-First Search linearization of @ISA the given
               stash.  The return value is a read-only AV*.  "level" should be
               0 (it is used internally in this function's recursion).

               You are responsible for "SvREFCNT_inc()" on the return value if
               you plan to store it anywhere semi-permanently (otherwise it
               might be deleted out from under you the next time the cache is
               invalidated).

                       AV*     mro_get_linear_isa_dfs(HV* stash, U32 level)

       mro_isa_changed_in
               Takes the necessary steps (cache invalidations, mostly) when
               the @ISA of the given package has changed.  Invoked by the
               "setisa" magic, should not need to invoke directly.

                       void    mro_isa_changed_in(HV* stash)

       mro_package_moved
               Call this function to signal to a stash that it has been
               assigned to another spot in the stash hierarchy.  "stash" is
               the stash that has been assigned. "oldstash" is the stash it
               replaces, if any.  "gv" is the glob that is actually being
               assigned to.

               This can also be called with a null first argument to indicate
               that "oldstash" has been deleted.

               This function invalidates isa caches on the old stash, on all
               subpackages nested inside it, and on the subclasses of all
               those, including non-existent packages that have corresponding
               entries in "stash".

               It also sets the effective names ("HvENAME") on all the stashes
               as appropriate.

               If the "gv" is present and is not in the symbol table, then
               this function simply returns.  This checked will be skipped if
               "flags & 1".

                       void    mro_package_moved(HV * const stash,
                                                 HV * const oldstash,
                                                 const GV * const gv,
                                                 U32 flags)

Optree Manipulation Functions
       finalize_optree
               This function finalizes the optree. Should be called directly
               after the complete optree is built. It does some additional
               checking which can't be done in the normal ck_xxx functions and
               makes the tree thread-safe.

                       void    finalize_optree(OP* o)

Pad Data Structures

               The stash in which this "our" variable was declared.

                       HV *    PadnameOURSTASH()

       PadnameOUTER
               Whether this entry belongs to an outer pad.

                       bool    PadnameOUTER(PADNAME pn)

       PadnameTYPE
               The stash associated with a typed lexical.  This returns the
               %Foo:: hash for "my Foo $bar".

                       HV *    PAD_COMPNAME_TYPE(PADOFFSET po)

       pad_peg When PERL_MAD is enabled, this is a small no-op function that
               gets called at the start of each pad-related function.  It can
               be breakpointed to track all pad operations.  The parameter is
               a string indicating the type of pad operation being performed.

               NOTE: this function is experimental and may change or be
               removed without notice.

       PAD_SET_CUR
               Set the current pad to be pad "n" in the padlist, saving the
               previous current pad. NB currently this macro expands to a
               string too long for some compilers, so it's best to replace it
               with

                   SAVECOMPPAD();
                   PAD_SET_CUR_NOSAVE(padlist,n);

       PAD_SVl Lightweight and lvalue version of "PAD_SV".  Get or set the
               value at offset "po" in the current pad.  Unlike "PAD_SV", does
               not print diagnostics with -DX.  For internal use only.

                       SV *    PAD_SVl(PADOFFSET po)

               save PL_comppad and PL_curpad

                       void    SAVECOMPPAD()

       SAVEPADSV
               Save a pad slot (used to restore after an iteration)

               XXX DAPM it would make more sense to make the arg a PADOFFSET
                    void SAVEPADSV(PADOFFSET po)

Per-Interpreter Variables
       PL_DBsingle
               When Perl is run in debugging mode, with the -d switch, this SV
               is a boolean which indicates whether subs are being single-
               stepped.  Single-stepping is automatically turned on after
               every step.  This is the C variable which corresponds to Perl's
               $DB::single variable.  See "PL_DBsub".

                       SV *    PL_DBsingle

       PL_DBsub
               When Perl is run in debugging mode, with the -d switch, this GV
               contains the SV which holds the name of the sub being debugged.
               This is the C variable which corresponds to Perl's $DB::sub
               variable.  See "PL_DBsingle".

       PL_DBtrace
               Trace variable used when Perl is run in debugging mode, with
               the -d switch.  This is the C variable which corresponds to
               Perl's $DB::trace variable.  See "PL_DBsingle".

                       SV *    PL_DBtrace

       PL_dowarn
               The C variable which corresponds to Perl's $^W warning
               variable.

       PL_ofsgv
               The glob containing the output field separator - "*," in Perl
               space.

                       GV*     PL_ofsgv

       PL_rs   The input record separator - $/ in Perl space.

Stack Manipulation Macros
       djSP    Declare Just "SP". This is actually identical to "dSP", and
               declares a local copy of perl's stack pointer, available via
               the "SP" macro.  See "SP".  (Available for backward source code
               compatibility with the old (Perl 5.005) thread model.)

                               djSP;

       LVRET   True if this op will be the return value of an lvalue
               subroutine

SV Manipulation Functions
       SvTHINKFIRST
               A quick flag check to see whether an sv should be passed to
               sv_force_normal to be "downgraded" before SvIVX or SvPVX can be
               modified directly.

               For example, if your scalar is a reference and you want to
               modify the SvIVX slot, you can't just do SvROK_off, as that
               will leak the referent.

               This is used internally by various sv-modifying functions, such
               as sv_setsv, sv_setiv and sv_pvn_force.

               One case that this does not handle is a gv without SvFAKE set.
               After

                   if (SvTHINKFIRST(gv)) sv_force_normal(gv);

               it will still be a gv.

               SvTHINKFIRST sometimes produces false positives.  In those
               cases sv_force_normal does nothing.

                       U32     SvTHINKFIRST(SV *sv)

       sv_add_arena
               Given a chunk of memory, link it to the head of the list of
               arenas, and split it into a list of free SVs.

                       void    sv_add_arena(char *const ptr, const U32 size,
                                            const U32 flags)

       sv_clean_all
               Decrement the refcnt of each remaining SV, possibly triggering
               a cleanup.  This function may have to be called multiple times
               to free SVs which are in complex self-referential hierarchies.

                       I32     sv_clean_all()

       sv_clean_objs
               Attempt to destroy all objects not yet freed.

                       void    sv_clean_objs()

       sv_free_arenas
               Deallocate the memory used by all arenas.  Note that all the
               individual SV heads and bodies within the arenas must already
               have been freed.

                       void    sv_free_arenas()

SV-Body Allocation
       sv_2num Return an SV with the numeric value of the source SV, doing any
               necessary reference or overload conversion.  You must use the
               "SvNUM(sv)" macro to access this function.

               NOTE: this function is experimental and may change or be
               removed without notice.

                       SV*     sv_2num(SV *const sv)

       sv_copypv
               Copies a stringified representation of the source SV into the
               destination SV.  Automatically performs any necessary mg_get
               and coercion of numeric values into strings.  Guaranteed to
               preserve UTF8 flag even from overloaded objects.  Similar in
               nature to sv_2pv[_flags] but operates directly on an SV instead
               of just the string.  Mostly uses sv_2pv_flags to do its work,
               except when that would lose the UTF-8'ness of the PV.

                       void    sv_copypv(SV *const dsv, SV *const ssv)

       sv_ref  Returns a SV describing what the SV passed in is a reference
               to.

                       SV*     sv_ref(SV *dst, const SV *const sv,
                                      const int ob)

Unicode Support
       find_uninit_var
               Find the name of the undefined variable (if any) that caused
               the operator to issue a "Use of uninitialized value" warning.
               If match is true, only return a name if its value matches
               uninit_sv.  So roughly speaking, if a unary operator (such as
               OP_COS) generates a warning, then following the direct child of
               the op may yield an OP_PADSV or OP_GV that gives the name of
               the undefined variable.  On the other hand, with OP_ADD there
               are two branches to follow, so we only print the variable name
               if we get an exact match.

               The name is returned as a mortal SV.

               Assumes that PL_op is the op that originally triggered the
               error, and that PL_comppad/PL_curpad points to the currently
               executing pad.

               NOTE: this function is experimental and may change or be
               removed without notice.

                       SV*     find_uninit_var(const OP *const obase,
                                               const SV *const uninit_sv,
                                               bool top)

       report_uninit
               Print appropriate "Use of uninitialized variable" warning.

                       void    report_uninit(const SV *uninit_sv)
