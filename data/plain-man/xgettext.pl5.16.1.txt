NAME
       xgettext.pl - Extract translatable strings from source

SYNOPSIS
       xgettext.pl [OPTION] [INPUTFILE]...

DESCRIPTION
       This program extracts translatable strings from given input files, or
       from STDIN if none are given.

       Please see Locale::Maketext::Extract for a list of supported input file
       formats.

OPTIONS
       Mandatory arguments to long options are mandatory for short options
       too.  Similarly for optional arguments.

   Input file location:
       INPUTFILE...
           Files to extract messages from.  If not specified, STDIN is
           assumed.

       -f, --files-from=FILE
           Get list of input files from FILE.

       -D, --directory=DIRECTORY
           Add DIRECTORY to list for input files search.

   Input file format:
       -u, --use-gettext-style
           Specifies that the source programs uses the Gettext style (e.g.
           %1) instead of the Maketext style (e.g. "[_1]") in its localization
           calls.

   Output file location:
       -d, --default-domain=NAME
           Use NAME.po for output, instead of "messages.po".

       -o, --output=FILE
           PO file name to be written or incrementally updated; "-" means
           writing to STDOUT.

       -p, --output-dir=DIR
           Output files will be placed in directory DIR.

   Output details:
       -g, --gnu-gettext
           Enables GNU gettext interoperability by printing "#,
           perl-maketext-format" before each entry that has "%" variables.

       -W, --wrap
           If wrap is enabled, then, for entries with multiple file locations,
           each location is listed on a separate line. The default is to put
           them all on a single line.

           Other comments are not affected.

   Plugins:
       By default, all builtin parser plugins are enabled for all file types,
       with warnings turned off.

       If any plugin is specified on the command line, then warnings are
       turned on by default - you can turn them off with "-now"

       -P|--plugin pluginname
               Use the specified plugin for the default file types recognised by that
               plugin.

       -P|--plugin 'pluginname=*'
               Use the specified plugin for all file types.

       -P|--plugin pluginname=ext,ext2
               Use the specified plugin for any files ending in C<.ext> or C<.ext2>

       -P|--plugin My::Module::Name='*'
               Use your custom plugin module for all file types

       Multiple plugins can be specified on the command line.

       Available plugins:

       "perl"    : Locale::Maketext::Extract::Plugin::Perl
           For a slightly more accurate but much slower Perl parser, you can
           use the PPI plugin. This does not have a short name, but must be
           specified in full, eg:

               xgettext.pl -P Locale::Maketext::Extract::Plugin::PPI

       "tt2"     : Locale::Maketext::Extract::Plugin::TT2
       "yaml"    : Locale::Maketext::Extract::Plugin::YAML
       "formfu"  : Locale::Maketext::Extract::Plugin::FormFu
       "mason"   : Locale::Maketext::Extract::Plugin::Mason
       "text"    : Locale::Maketext::Extract::Plugin::TextTemplate
       "generic" : Locale::Maketext::Extract::Plugin::Generic

   Warnings:
       If a parser plugin encounters a syntax error while parsing, it will
       abort parsing and hand over to the next parser plugin.  If warnings are
       turned on then the error will be echoed to STDERR.

       Off by default, unless any plugin has been specified on the command
       line.

       -w|--warnings
       -now|--nowarnings

   Verbose:
       If you would like to see which files have been processed, which plugins
       were used, and which strings were extracted, then enable "verbose". If
       no acceptable plugin was found, or no strings were extracted, then the
       file is not listed:

       -v|--verbose
           Lists processed files.

       -v -v|--verbose --verbose :
           Lists processed files and which plugins managed to extract strings.

       -v -v|--verbose --verbose :
           Lists processed files, which plugins managed to extract strings,
           and the extracted strings, the line where they were found, and any
           variables.
