NAME
     krb5-config -- give information on how to link code against Heimdal
     libraries

SYNOPSIS
     krb5-config [--prefix[=dir]] [--exec-prefix[=dir]] [--libs] [--cflags]
                 [libraries]

DESCRIPTION
     krb5-config tells the application programmer what special flags to use to
     compile and link programs against the libraries installed by Heimdal.

     Options supported:

     --prefix[=dir]
             Print the prefix if no dir is specified, otherwise set prefix to
             dir.

     --exec-prefix[=dir]
             Print the exec-prefix if no dir is specified, otherwise set exec-
             prefix to dir.

     --libs  Output the set of libraries that should be linked against.

     --cflags
             Output the set of flags to give to the C compiler when using the
             Heimdal libraries.

     By default krb5-config will output the set of flags and libraries to be
     used by a normal program using the krb5 API.  The user can also supply a
     library to be used, the supported ones are:

     krb5    (the default)

     gssapi  use the krb5 gssapi mechanism

     kadm-client
             use the client-side kadmin libraries

     kadm-server
             use the server-side kadmin libraries
