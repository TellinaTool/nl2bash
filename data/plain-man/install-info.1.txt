NAME
       install-info - update info/dir entries

SYNOPSIS
       install-info [OPTION]... [INFO-FILE [DIR-FILE]]

DESCRIPTION
       Install or delete dir entries from INFO-FILE in the Info directory file
       DIR-FILE.

OPTIONS
       --delete
              delete existing  entries  for  INFO-FILE  from  DIR-FILE;  don't
              insert any new entries.

       --dir-file=NAME
              specify file name of Info directory file.  This is equivalent to
              using the DIR-FILE argument.

       --entry=TEXT
              insert TEXT as an Info directory entry.  TEXT  should  have  the
              form  of  an  Info  menu item line plus zero or more extra lines
              starting with whitespace.  If you specify more than  one  entry,
              they  are all added.  If you don't specify any entries, they are
              determined from information in the Info file itself.

       --help display this help and exit.

       --info-file=FILE
              specify Info file to install in the directory.  This is  equiva-
              lent to using the INFO-FILE argument.

       --info-dir=DIR
              same as --dir-file=DIR/dir.

       --item=TEXT
              same  as  --entry  TEXT.   An Info directory entry is actually a
              menu item.

       --quiet
              suppress warnings.

       --remove
              same as --delete.

       --section=SEC
              put this file's entries in section SEC of the directory.  If you
              specify more than one section, all the entries are added in each
              of the sections.  If you don't specify any  sections,  they  are
              determined from information in the Info file itself.

       --version
              display version information and exit.
