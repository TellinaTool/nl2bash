WHICH(1)                  BSD General Commands Manual                 WHICH(1)

NAME
     which -- locate a program file in the user's path

SYNOPSIS
     which [-as] program ...

DESCRIPTION
     The which utility takes a list of command names and searches the path for
     each executable file that would be run had these commands actually been
     invoked.

     The following options are available:

     -a      List all instances of executables found (instead of just the
             first one of each).

     -s      No output, just return 0 if any of the executables are found, or
             1 if none are found.

     Some shells may provide a builtin which command which is similar or iden-
     tical to this utility.  Consult the builtin(1) manual page.
