.SH DESCRIPTION
The
.BR ioctl (2)
system call can be used to read and write metadata of FAT filesystems that
are not accessible using other system calls.
.SS Reading and setting file attributes
Files and directories in the FAT filesystem possess an attribute bit mask that
can be read with
.B FAT_IOCTL_GET_ATTRIBUTES
and written with
.BR FAT_IOCTL_SET_ATTRIBUTES .
.PP
The
.I fd
argument contains a file descriptor for a file or directory.
It is sufficient to create the file descriptor by calling
.BR open (2)
with the
.B O_RDONLY
flag.
.PP
The
.I attr
argument contains a pointer to a bit mask.
The bits of the bit mask are:
.TP
.B ATTR_RO
This bit specifies that the file or directory is read-only.
.TP
.B ATTR_HIDDEN
This bit specifies that the file or directory is hidden.
.TP
.B ATTR_SYS
This bit specifies that the file is a system file.
.TP
.B ATTR_VOLUME
This bit specifies that the file is a volume label.
This attribute is read-only.
.TP
.B ATTR_DIR
This bit specifies that this is a directory.
This attribute is read-only.
.TP
.B ATTR_ARCH
This bit indicates that this file or directory should be archived.
It is set when a file is created or modified.
It is reset by an archiving system.
.PP
The zero value
.B ATTR_NONE
can be used to indicate that no attribute bit is set.
.SS Reading the volume label
FAT filesystems are identified by a volume label.
The volume label can be read with
.BR FAT_IOCTL_GET_VOLUME_ID .
.PP
The
.I fd
argument can be a file descriptor for any file or directory of the
filesystem.
It is sufficient to create the file descriptor by calling
.BR open (2)
with the
.B O_RDONLY
flag.
.PP
The
.I id
argument is a pointer to the field that will be filled with the volume ID.
Typically the volume label is displayed to the user as a group of two
16-bit fields:
.PP
.in +4n
.nf
printf("Volume ID %4x-%4x\\n", id >> 16, id & 0xFFFF);
.fi
.in
.SS Reading short file names of a directory
A file or directory on a FAT filesystem always has a short filename
consisting of up to 8 capital letters, optionally followed by a period
and up to 3 capital letters for the file extension.
If the actual filename does not fit into this scheme, it is stored
as a long filename of up to 255 UTF-16 characters.
.PP
The short filenames in a directory can be read with
.BR VFAT_IOCTL_READDIR_SHORT .
.B VFAT_IOCTL_READDIR_BOTH
reads both the short and the long filenames.
.PP
The
.I fd
argument must be a file descriptor for a directory.
It is sufficient to create the file descriptor by calling
.BR open (2)
with the
.B O_RDONLY
flag.
The file descriptor can be used only once to iterate over the directory
entries by calling
.BR ioctl (2)
repeatedly.
.PP
The
.I entry
argument is a two-element array of the following structures:

.in +4n
.nf
struct __fat_dirent {
    long            d_ino;
    __kernel_off_t  d_off;
    uint32_t short  d_reclen;
    char            d_name[256];
};
.fi
.in
.PP
The first entry in the array is for the short filename.
The second entry is for the long filename.
.PP
The
.I d_ino
and
.I d_off
fields are filled only for long filenames.
The
.I d_ino
field holds the inode number of the directory.
The
.I d_off
field holds the offset of the file entry in the directory.
As these values are not available for short filenames, the user code should
simply ignore them.
.PP
The field
.I d_reclen
contains the length of the filename in the field
.IR d_name .
To keep backward compatibility, a length of 0 for the short filename signals
that the end of the directory has been reached.
However, the preferred method for detecting the end of the directory
is to test the
.BR ioctl ()
return value.
If no long filename exists, field
.I d_reclen
is set to 0 and
.I d_name
is a character string of length 0 for the long filename.
.SH RETURN VALUE
On error, \-1 is returned, and
.I errno
is set to indicate the error.
.PP
For
.B VFAT_IOCTL_READDIR_BOTH
and
.B VFAT_IOCTL_READDIR_SHORT
a return value of 1 signals that a new directory entry has been read and
a return value of 0 signals that the end of the directory has been reached.
.SH ERRORS
.TP
.B ENOENT
This error is returned by
.B VFAT_IOCTL_READDIR_BOTH
and
.B VFAT_IOCTL_READDIR_SHORT
if the file descriptor
.I fd
refers to a removed, but still open directory.
.TP
.B ENOTDIR
This error is returned by
.B VFAT_IOCTL_READDIR_BOTH
and
.B VFAT_IOCTL_READDIR_SHORT
if the file descriptor
.I fd
does not refer to a directory.
.TP
.B ENOTTY
The file descriptor
.I fd
does not refer to an object in a FAT filesystem.
.PP
For further error values, see
.BR ioctl (2).
.SH VERSIONS
.BR VFAT_IOCTL_READDIR_BOTH
and
.B VFAT_IOCTL_READDIR_SHORT
first appeared in Linux 2.0.

.BR FAT_IOCTL_GET_ATTRIBUTES
and
.BR FAT_IOCTL_SET_ATTRIBUTES
first appeared
.\" just before we got Git history
in Linux 2.6.12.

.B FAT_IOCTL_GET_VOLUME_ID
was introduced in version 3.11
.\" commit 6e5b93ee55d401f1619092fb675b57c28c9ed7ec
of the Linux kernel.
.SH CONFORMING TO
This API is Linux-specific.
.SH EXAMPLE
.SS Toggling the archive flag
The following program demonstrates the usage of
.BR ioctl ()
to manipulate file attributes.
The program reads and displays the archive attribute of a file.
After inverting the value of the attribute,
the program reads and displays the attribute again.
.PP
The following was recorded when applying the program for the file
.IR /mnt/user/foo :

.in +4n
.nf
# ./toggle_fat_archive_flag /mnt/user/foo
Archive flag is set
