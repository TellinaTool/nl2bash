.SH ERRORS
.TP
.B EACCES
Write access to the directory containing

was not allowed, or one of the directories in the path prefix of
.I pathname
did not allow search permission.
(See also
.BR path_resolution (7).
.TP
.B EBUSY
.I pathname
is currently in use by the system or some process that prevents its
removal.

.TP
.B ENOENT
A directory component in
.I pathname
does not exist or is a dangling symbolic link.
.TP

.I pathname
contains entries other than
.IR . " and " .. " ;"
or,
.I pathname
has
.I ..
as its final component.
POSIX.1 also allows
.\" POSIX.1-2001, POSIX.1-2008
.B EEXIST
for this condition.
.TP
.B EPERM
The directory containing
.I pathname
has the sticky bit
.RB ( S_ISVTX )
set and the process's effective user ID is neither the user ID
of the file to be deleted nor that of the directory containing it,
and the process is not privileged (Linux: does not have the
.B CAP_FOWNER
capability).
.TP
.B EPERM
The filesystem containing
.I pathname
does not support the removal of directories.
.TP
.B EROFS
.I pathname
refers to a directory on a read-only filesystem.
