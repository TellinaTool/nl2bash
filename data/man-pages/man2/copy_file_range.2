.TH COPY 2 2015-11-06 "Linux" "Linux Programmer's Manual"
.SH NAME
copy_file_range \- Copy a range of data from one file to another
.SH SYNOPSIS
.nf
.B #include <sys/syscall.h>
.B #include <unistd.h>

.BI "ssize_t copy_file_range(int " fd_in ", loff_t *" off_in ,
.BI "                        int " fd_out ", loff_t *" off_out ,
.BI "                        size_t " len ", unsigned int " flags );
.fi
.SH DESCRIPTION
The
.BR copy_file_range ()
system call performs an in-kernel copy between two file descriptors
without the additional cost of transferring data from the kernel to user space
and then back into the kernel.
It copies up to
.I len
bytes of data from file descriptor
.I fd_in
to file descriptor
.IR fd_out ,
overwriting any data that exists within the requested range of the target file.

The following semantics apply for
.IR off_in ,
and similar statements apply to
.IR off_out :
.IP * 3
If
.I off_in
is NULL, then bytes are read from
.I fd_in
starting from the file offset, and the file offset is
adjusted by the number of bytes copied.
.IP *
If
.I off_in
is not NULL, then
.I off_in
must point to a buffer that specifies the starting
offset where bytes from
.I fd_in
will be read.
The file offset of
.I fd_in
is not changed, but
.I off_in
is adjusted appropriately.
.PP

The
.I flags
argument is provided to allow for future extensions
and currently must be to 0.
.SH RETURN VALUE
Upon successful completion,
.BR copy_file_range ()
will return the number of bytes copied between files.
This could be less than the length originally requested.

On error,
.BR copy_file_range ()
returns \-1 and
.I errno
is set to indicate the error.
.SH ERRORS
.TP
.B EBADF
One or more file descriptors are not valid; or
.I fd_in
is not open for reading; or
.I fd_out
is not open for writing; or
the
.B O_APPEND
flag is set for the open file description referred to by
.IR fd_out .
.TP
.B EINVAL
Requested range extends beyond the end of the source file; or the
.I flags
argument is not 0.
.TP
.B EIO
A low-level I/O error occurred while copying.
.TP
.B ENOMEM
Out of memory.
.TP
.B ENOSPC
There is not enough space on the target filesystem to complete the copy.
.TP
.B EXDEV
The files referred to by
.IR file_in " and " file_out
are not on the same mounted filesystem.
.SH VERSIONS
The
.BR copy_file_range ()
system call first appeared in Linux 4.5.
.SH CONFORMING TO
The
.BR copy_file_range ()
system call is a nonstandard Linux extension.
.SH NOTES
If
.I file_in
is a sparse file, then
.BR copy_file_range ()
may expand any holes existing in the requested range.
Users may benefit from calling
.BR copy_file_range ()
in a loop, and using the
.BR lseek (2)
.BR SEEK_DATA
and
.BR SEEK_HOLE
operations to find the locations of data segments.

.BR copy_file_range ()
gives filesystems an opportunity to implement "copy acceleration" techniques,
such as the use of reflinks (i.e., two or more i-nodes that share
pointers to the same copy-on-write disk blocks)
or server-side-copy (in the case of NFS).
