.SH SYNOPSIS
.B #include <unistd.h>
.br
.B #include <sys/types.h>
.sp
.B gid_t getgid(void);
.br
.B gid_t getegid(void);
.SH DESCRIPTION
.BR getgid ()
returns the real group ID of the calling process.

.BR getegid ()
returns the effective group ID of the calling process.
.SH ERRORS
These functions are always successful.
.SH CONFORMING TO
POSIX.1-2001, POSIX.1-2008, 4.3BSD.
.SH NOTES
The original Linux
.BR getgid ()
and
.BR getegid ()
system calls supported only 16-bit group IDs.
Subsequently, Linux 2.4 added
.BR getgid32 ()
and
.BR getegid32 (),
supporting 32-bit IDs.
The glibc
.BR getgid ()
and
.BR getegid ()
wrapper functions transparently deal with the variations across kernel versions.
