.TH REMOVEXATTR 2 2015-05-07 "Linux" "Linux Programmer's Manual"
.SH NAME
removexattr, lremovexattr, fremovexattr \- remove an extended attribute
.SH SYNOPSIS

.nf
.B #include <sys/types.h>
.B #include <sys/xattr.h>
.sp
.BI "int removexattr(const char\ *" path ", const char\ *" name );
.BI "int lremovexattr(const char\ *" path ", const char\ *" name );
.BI "int fremovexattr(int " fd ", const char\ *" name );

.SH DESCRIPTION
Extended attributes are
.IR name : value
pairs associated with inodes (files, directories, symbolic links, etc.).
They are extensions to the normal attributes which are associated
with all inodes in the system (i.e., the
.BR stat (2)
data).
A complete overview of extended attributes concepts can be found in
.BR xattr (7).
.PP
.BR removexattr ()
removes the extended attribute identified by
.I name
and associated with the given
.I path
in the filesystem.
.PP
.BR lremovexattr ()
is identical to
.BR removexattr (),
except in the case of a symbolic link, where the extended attribute is
removed from the link itself, not the file that it refers to.
.PP
.BR fremovexattr ()
is identical to
.BR removexattr (),
only the extended attribute is removed from the open file referred to by
.I fd
(as returned by
.BR open (2))
in place of
.IR path .
.PP
An extended attribute name is a null-terminated string.
The
.I name
includes a namespace prefix; there may be several, disjoint
namespaces associated with an individual inode.
.SH RETURN VALUE
On success, zero is returned.
On failure, \-1 is returned and
.I errno
is set appropriately.
.SH ERRORS
.TP
.B ENOATTR
The named attribute does not exist.
.RB ( ENOATTR
is defined to be a synonym for
.BR ENODATA
in
.IR <attr/xattr.h> .)
.TP
.B ENOTSUP
Extended attributes are not supported by the filesystem, or are disabled.
.PP
In addition, the errors documented in
.BR stat (2)
can also occur.
.SH VERSIONS
These system calls have been available on Linux since kernel 2.4;
glibc support is provided since version 2.3.
.SH CONFORMING TO
These system calls are Linux-specific.
