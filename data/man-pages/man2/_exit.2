.SH DESCRIPTION
The function
.BR _exit ()
terminates the calling process "immediately".
Any open file descriptors
belonging to the process are closed; any children of the process are
inherited by process 1,
.IR init ,
and the process's parent is sent a
.B SIGCHLD
signal.
.LP
The value
.I status
is returned to the parent process as the process's exit status, and
can be collected using one of the
.BR wait (2)
family of calls.
.LP
The function
.BR _Exit ()
is equivalent to
.BR _exit ().
.SH RETURN VALUE
These functions do not return.
.SH CONFORMING TO
POSIX.1-2001, POSIX.1-2008, SVr4, 4.3BSD.
The function
.BR _Exit ()
was introduced by C99.
.SH NOTES
For a discussion on the effects of an exit, the transmission of
exit status, zombie processes, signals sent, and so on, see
.BR exit (3).
.LP
The function
.BR _exit ()
is like
.BR exit (3),
but does not call any
functions registered with
.BR atexit (3)
or
.BR on_exit (3).
Open
.BR stdio (3)
streams are not flushed.
On the other hand,
.BR _exit ()
does close open file descriptors, and this may cause an unknown delay,
waiting for pending output to finish.
If the delay is undesired,
it may be useful to call functions like
.BR tcflush (3)
before calling
.BR _exit ().
Whether any pending I/O is canceled, and which pending I/O may be
canceled upon
.BR _exit (),
is implementation-dependent.
.SS C library/kernel differences
In glibc up to version 2.3, the
.BR _exit ()
wrapper function invoked the kernel system call of the same name.
Since glibc 2.3, the wrapper function invokes
.BR exit_group (2),
in order to terminate all of the threads in a process.
