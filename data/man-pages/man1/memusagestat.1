.TH MEMUSAGESTAT 1 2014-09-06 "GNU" "Linux programmer's manual"
.SH NAME
memusagestat \- generate graphic from memory profiling data
.SH SYNOPSIS
.BR memusagestat " [\fIoption\fR]... \fIdatafile\fR [\fIoutfile\fR]"
.SH DESCRIPTION
.B memusagestat
creates a PNG file containing a graphical representation of the
memory profiling data in the file
.IR datafile ;
that file is generated via the
.I -d
(or
.IR --data )
option of
.BR memusage (1).

The red line in the graph shows the heap usage (allocated memory)
and the green line shows the stack usage.
The x-scale is either the number of memory-handling function calls or
(if the
.I -t
option is specified)
time.
.SH OPTIONS
.TP
.BI \-o\  file \fR,\ \fB\-\-output= file
Name of the output file.
.TP
.BI \-s\  string \fR,\ \fB\-\-string= string
Use
.I string
as the title inside the output graph.
.TP
.BI \-t\fR,\ \fB\-\-time
Use time (rather than number of function calls) as the scale for the X axis.
.TP
.BI \-T\fR,\ \fB\-\-total
Also draw a graph of total memory consumption.
.TP
.BI \-x\  size \fR,\ \fB\-\-x-size= size
Make the output graph
.I size
pixels wide.
.TP
.BI \-y\  size \fR,\ \fB\-\-y\-size= size
Make the output graph
.I size
pixels high.
.TP
.BI \-?\fR,\ \fB\-\-help
Print a help message and exit.
.TP
.BI \fB\-\-usage
Print a short usage message and exit.
