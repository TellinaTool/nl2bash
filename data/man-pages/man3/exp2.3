.SH DESCRIPTION
These functions return the value of 2 raised to the power of
.IR x .
.SH RETURN VALUE
On success, these functions return the base-2 exponential value of
.IR x .

For various special cases, including the handling of infinity and NaN,
as well as overflows and underflows, see
.BR exp (3).
.SH ERRORS
See
.BR math_error (7)
for information on how to determine whether an error has occurred
when calling these functions.

For a discussion of the errors that can occur for these functions, see
.BR exp (3).
.SH VERSIONS
These functions first appeared in glibc in version 2.1.
