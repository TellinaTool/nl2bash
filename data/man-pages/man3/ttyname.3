.SH DESCRIPTION
The function
.BR ttyname ()
returns a pointer to the null-terminated pathname of the terminal device
that is open on the file descriptor \fIfd\fP, or NULL on error
(for example, if \fIfd\fP is not connected to a terminal).
The return value may point to static data, possibly overwritten by the

The function
.BR ttyname_r ()
stores this pathname in the buffer
.I buf
of length
.IR buflen .
.SH RETURN VALUE

.BR ttyname ()
returns a pointer to a pathname on success.
On error, NULL is returned, and
.I errno
is set appropriately.
The function
