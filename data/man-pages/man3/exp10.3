.SH DESCRIPTION
These functions return the value of 10
raised to the power of
.IR x .
.SH RETURN VALUE
On success, these functions return the base-10 exponential value of
.IR x .

For various special cases, including the handling of infinity and NaN,
as well as overflows and underflows, see
.BR exp (3).
.SH ERRORS
See
.BR math_error (7)
for information on how to determine whether an error has occurred
when calling these functions.

For a discussion of the errors that can occur for these functions, see
.BR exp (3).
.SH VERSIONS
These functions first appeared in glibc in version 2.1.
.SH ATTRIBUTES
For an explanation of the terms used in this section, see
.BR attributes (7).

.SH CONFORMING TO
These functions are GNU extensions.
.SH BUGS
Prior to version 2.19, the glibc implementation of these functions did not set
.I errno
to
.B ERANGE
when an underflow error occurred.
