.SH DESCRIPTION
The

The memory areas may overlap: copying takes place as though
the bytes in

are first copied into a temporary array that does not overlap
.I src
or
.IR dest ,
and the bytes are then copied from the temporary array to
.IR dest .
.SH RETURN VALUE
The
.BR memmove ()
function returns a pointer to
