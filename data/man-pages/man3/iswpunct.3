.TH ISWPUNCT 3  2015-08-08 "GNU" "Linux Programmer's Manual"
.SH NAME
iswpunct \- test for punctuation or symbolic wide character
.SH SYNOPSIS
.nf
.B #include <wctype.h>
.sp
.BI "int iswpunct(wint_t " wc );
.fi
.SH DESCRIPTION
The
.BR iswpunct ()
function is the wide-character equivalent of the
.BR ispunct (3)
function.
It tests whether
.I wc
is a wide character
belonging to the wide-character class "punct".
.PP
The wide-character class "punct" is a subclass of the wide-character class
"graph", and therefore also a subclass of the wide-character class "print".
.PP
The wide-character class "punct" is disjoint from the wide-character class
"alnum" and therefore also disjoint from its subclasses "alpha", "upper",
"lower", "digit", "xdigit".
.PP
Being a subclass of the wide-character class "print",
the wide-character class
"punct" is disjoint from the wide-character class "cntrl".
.PP
Being a subclass of the wide-character class "graph",
the wide-character class
"punct" is disjoint from the wide-character class "space" and its subclass
"blank".
.SH RETURN VALUE
The
.BR iswpunct ()
function returns nonzero
if
.I wc
is a wide-character
belonging to the wide-character class "punct".
Otherwise, it returns zero.
.SH ATTRIBUTES
For an explanation of the terms used in this section, see

.SH NOTES
The behavior of
.BR iswpunct ()
depends on the
.B LC_CTYPE
category of the
current locale.
.PP
This function's name is a misnomer when dealing with Unicode characters,
because the wide-character class "punct" contains both punctuation characters
and symbol (math, currency, etc.) characters.
