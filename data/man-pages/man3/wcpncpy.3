.SH DESCRIPTION
The
.BR wcpncpy ()
function is the wide-character equivalent
of the
.BR stpncpy (3)
function.
It copies at most
.I n
wide characters from the wide-character
string pointed to by
.IR src ,
including the terminating null wide (L\(aq\\0\(aq),
to the array pointed to by
.IR dest .
Exactly
.I n
wide characters are
written at
.IR dest .
If the length
.IR wcslen(src)
is smaller than
.IR n ,
the remaining wide characters in the array pointed to
by
.I dest
are filled with L\(aq\\0\(aq characters.
If the length
.IR wcslen(src)
is greater than or equal
to
.IR n ,
the string pointed to by
.I dest
will
not be L\(aq\\0\(aq terminated.
.PP
The strings may not overlap.
.PP
The programmer must ensure that there is room for at least
.I n
wide
characters at
.IR dest .
.SH RETURN VALUE
.BR wcpncpy ()
returns a pointer to the last wide character written, that is,
.IR dest + n \-1.
