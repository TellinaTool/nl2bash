.SH DESCRIPTION
These functions return the result of multiplying the floating-point number
.I x
by 2 raised to the power
.IR exp .
.SH RETURN VALUE
On success, these functions return
.IR "x * (2^exp)" .

If
.I exp
is zero, then
.I x
is returned.

If
.I x
is a NaN,
a NaN is returned.

If
.I x
is positive infinity (negative infinity),
positive infinity (negative infinity) is returned.

If the result underflows,
a range error occurs,
and zero is returned.

If the result overflows,
a range error occurs,
and the functions return
.BR HUGE_VAL ,
.BR HUGE_VALF ,
or
.BR HUGE_VALL ,
respectively, with a sign the same as
.IR x .
.SH ERRORS
See
.BR math_error (7)
for information on how to determine whether an error has occurred
when calling these functions.
.PP
The following errors can occur:
.TP
Range error, overflow
.I errno
is set to
.BR ERANGE .
An overflow floating-point exception
.RB ( FE_OVERFLOW )
is raised.
.TP
Range error, underflow
.I errno
is set to
.BR ERANGE .
An underflow floating-point exception
.RB ( FE_UNDERFLOW )
is raised.
