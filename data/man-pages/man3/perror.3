.SH DESCRIPTION
The
.BR perror ()
function produces a message on standard error describing the last
error encountered during a call to a system or library function.

First (if
.I s
is not NULL and
.I *s
is not a null byte (\(aq\\0\(aq)), the argument string
.I s
is printed, followed by a colon and a blank.
Then an error message corresponding to the current value of
.I errno
and a new-line.

To be of most use, the argument string should include the name
of the function that incurred the error.

The global error list
.IR sys_errlist "[],"
which can be indexed by
.IR errno ,
can be used to obtain the error message without the newline.
The largest message number provided in the table is
.IR sys_nerr "\-1."
Be careful when directly accessing this list, because new error values
may not have been added to
.IR sys_errlist "[]."
The use of
.IR sys_errlist "[]"
is nowadays deprecated.

When a system call fails, it usually returns \-1 and sets the
variable
.I errno
to a value describing what went wrong.
(These values can be found in
.IR <errno.h> .)
Many library functions do likewise.
The function
.BR perror ()
serves to translate this error code into human-readable form.
Note that
.I errno
is undefined after a successful system call or library function call:
this call may well change this variable, even though it succeeds,
for example because it internally used some other library function that failed.
Thus, if a failing call is not immediately followed by a call to
.BR perror (),
the value of
.I errno
should be saved.

.SH CONFORMING TO
.BR perror (),
.IR errno :
POSIX.1-2001, POSIX.1-2008, C89, C99, 4.3BSD.

The externals
.I sys_nerr
and
.I sys_errlist
derive from BSD, but are not specified in POSIX.1.
.SH NOTES
The externals
.I sys_nerr
and
.I sys_errlist
are defined by glibc, but in
.IR <stdio.h> .
.\" and only when _BSD_SOURCE is defined.
.\" When
.\" .B _GNU_SOURCE
.\" is defined, the symbols
.\" .I _sys_nerr
.\" and
.\" .I _sys_errlist
.\" are provided.
