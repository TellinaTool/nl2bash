.TH GETGROUPLIST 3 2015-03-02 "GNU" "Linux Programmer's Manual"
.SH NAME
getgrouplist \- get list of groups to which a user belongs
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B #include <grp.h>
.sp
.BI "int getgrouplist(const char *" user ", gid_t " group ,
.br
.BI "                 gid_t *" groups ", int *" ngroups );
.sp
.in -4n
Feature Test Macro Requirements for glibc (see
.BR feature_test_macros (7)):
.in
.sp
.BR getgrouplist ():
_BSD_SOURCE
.SH DESCRIPTION
The
.BR getgrouplist ()
function scans the group database (see
.BR group (5))
to obtain the list of groups that
.I user
belongs to.
Up to
.I *ngroups
of these groups are returned in the array
.IR groups .

If it was not among the groups defined for
.I user
in the group database, then
.I group
is included in the list of groups returned by
.BR getgrouplist ();
typically this argument is specified as the group ID from
the password record for
.IR user .

The
.I ngroups
argument is a value-result argument:
on return it always contains the number of groups found for
.IR user ,
including
.IR group ;
this value may be greater than the number of groups stored in
.IR groups .
.SH RETURN VALUE
If the number of groups of which
.I user
is a member is less than or equal to
.IR *ngroups ,
then the value
.I *ngroups
is returned.

If the user is a member of more than
.I *ngroups
groups, then
.BR getgrouplist ()
returns \-1.
In this case, the value returned in
.IR *ngroups
can be used to resize the buffer passed to a further call
.BR getgrouplist ().
.SH VERSIONS
This function is present since glibc 2.2.4.

.SH CONFORMING TO
This function is nonstandard; it appears on most BSDs.
.SH BUGS
In glibc versions before 2.3.3,
the implementation of this function contains a buffer-overrun bug:
it returns the complete list of groups for
.IR user
in the array
.IR groups ,
even when the number of groups exceeds
.IR *ngroups .
.SH EXAMPLE
.PP
The program below displays the group list for the user named in its
first command-line argument.
The second command-line argument specifies the
.I ngroups
value to be supplied to
.BR getgrouplist ().
The following shell session shows examples of the use of this program:
.in +4n
.nf

.RB "$" " ./a.out cecilia 0"
getgrouplist() returned \-1; ngroups = 3
.RB "$" " ./a.out cecilia 3"
ngroups = 3
16 (dialout)
33 (video)
100 (users)
