.SH DESCRIPTION
These functions return the natural logarithm of
.IR x .
.SH RETURN VALUE
On success, these functions return the natural logarithm of
.IR x .

If
.I x
is a NaN,
a NaN is returned.

If
.I x
is 1, the result is +0.

If
.I x
is positive infinity,
positive infinity is returned.

If
.I x
is zero,
then a pole error occurs, and the functions return
.RB - HUGE_VAL ,
.RB - HUGE_VALF ,
or
.RB - HUGE_VALL ,
respectively.

If
.I x
is negative (including negative infinity), then
a domain error occurs, and a NaN (not a number) is returned.
.SH ERRORS
See
.BR math_error (7)
for information on how to determine whether an error has occurred
when calling these functions.
.PP
The following errors can occur:
.TP
Domain error: \fIx\fP is negative
.I errno
is set to
.BR EDOM .
An invalid floating-point exception
.RB ( FE_INVALID )
is raised.
.TP
Pole error: \fIx\fP is zero
.I errno
is set to
.BR ERANGE .
A divide-by-zero floating-point exception
.RB ( FE_DIVBYZERO )
is raised.
.SH ATTRIBUTES
For an explanation of the terms used in this section, see
.BR attributes (7).

.SH CONFORMING TO
C99, POSIX.1-2001, POSIX.1-2008.

The variant returning
.I double
also conforms to
SVr4, 4.3BSD, C89.
.SH BUGS
In glibc 2.5 and earlier,
taking the
.BR log ()
of a NaN produces a bogus invalid floating-point
.RB ( FE_INVALID )
exception.
