.SH DESCRIPTION
The
.BR fgetgrent ()
function returns a pointer to a structure containing
the group information from the file referred to by
.IR stream .
The first time it is called
it returns the first entry; thereafter, it returns successive entries.
The file referred to by
.I stream
must have the same format as
.I /etc/group
(see
.BR group (5)).
.PP
The \fIgroup\fP structure is defined in \fI<grp.h>\fP as follows:
.sp
.in +4n
.nf
struct group {
    char   *gr_name;        /* group name */
    char   *gr_passwd;      /* group password */
    gid_t   gr_gid;         /* group ID */
    char  **gr_mem;         /* NULL-terminated array of pointers
                               to names of group members */
};
.fi
.in
.SH RETURN VALUE
The
.BR fgetgrent ()
function returns a pointer to a
.I group
structure,
or NULL if there are no more entries or an error occurs.
In the event of an error,
.I errno
is set to indicate the cause.
.SH ERRORS
.TP
