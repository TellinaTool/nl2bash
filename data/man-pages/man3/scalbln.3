.SH DESCRIPTION
These functions multiply their first argument
.I x
by
.B FLT_RADIX
(probably 2)
to the power of
.IR exp ,
that is:
.nf

    x * FLT_RADIX ** exp
.fi

The definition of
.B FLT_RADIX
can be obtained by including
.IR <float.h> .
.\" not in /usr/include but in a gcc lib
.SH RETURN VALUE
On success, these functions return
.IR x
*
.B FLT_RADIX
**
.IR exp .

If
.I x
is a NaN, a NaN is returned.

If
.I x
is positive infinity (negative infinity),
positive infinity (negative infinity) is returned.

If
.I x
is +0 (\-0), +0 (\-0) is returned.

If the result overflows,
a range error occurs,
and the functions return
.BR HUGE_VAL ,
.BR HUGE_VALF ,
or
.BR HUGE_VALL ,
respectively, with a sign the same as
.IR x .

If the result underflows,
a range error occurs,
and the functions return zero, with a sign the same as
.IR x .
.SH ERRORS
See
.BR math_error (7)
for information on how to determine whether an error has occurred
when calling these functions.
.PP
The following errors can occur:
.TP
Range error, overflow
.\" .I errno
.\" is set to
.\" .BR ERANGE .
An overflow floating-point exception
.RB ( FE_OVERFLOW )
is raised.
.TP
Range error, underflow
.\" .I errno
.\" is set to
.\" .BR ERANGE .
An underflow floating-point exception
.RB ( FE_UNDERFLOW )
is raised.
.PP
These functions do not set
.IR errno .
.\" FIXME . Is it intentional that these functions do not set errno?
.\" Bug raised: http://sources.redhat.com/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=6803
.SH VERSIONS
These functions first appeared in glibc in version 2.1.

C99, POSIX.1-2001, POSIX.1-2008.
.SH NOTES
These functions differ from the obsolete functions described in
.BR scalb (3)
in the type of their second argument.
The functions described on this page have a second argument
of an integral type, while those in
.BR scalb (3)
have a second argument of type
.IR double .

If
.B FLT_RADIX
equals 2 (which is usual), then
.BR scalbn ()
is equivalent to
.BR ldexp (3).
