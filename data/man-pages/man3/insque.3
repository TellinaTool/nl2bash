.SH DESCRIPTION
The
.BR insque ()
and
.BR remque ()
functions manipulate doubly-linked lists.
Each element in the list is a structure of
which the first two elements are a forward and a
backward pointer.
The linked list may be linear (i.e., NULL forward pointer at
the end of the list and NULL backward pointer at the start of the list)
or circular.

The
.BR insque ()
function inserts the element pointed to by \fIelem\fP
immediately after the element pointed to by \fIprev\fP.

If the list is linear, then the call
.I "insque(elem, NULL)"
can be used to insert the initial list element,
and the call sets the forward and backward pointers of
.I elem
to NULL.

If the list is circular,
the caller should ensure that the forward and backward pointers of the
first element are initialized to point to that element,
and the
.I prev
argument of the
.BR insque ()
call should also point to the element.

The
.BR remque ()
function removes the element pointed to by \fIelem\fP from the
doubly-linked list.

.SH CONFORMING TO
POSIX.1-2001, POSIX.1-2008.
.SH NOTES
Traditionally (e.g., SunOS, Linux libc4 and libc5),
the arguments of these functions were of type \fIstruct qelem *\fP,
defined as:

.in +4n
.nf
struct qelem {
    struct qelem *q_forw;
    struct qelem *q_back;
    char          q_data[1];
};
.fi
.in

This is still what you will get if
.B _GNU_SOURCE
is defined before
including \fI<search.h>\fP.

The location of the prototypes for these functions differs among several
versions of UNIX.
The above is the POSIX version.
Some systems place them in \fI<string.h>\fP.
.\" Linux libc4 and libc 5 placed them
.\" in \fI<stdlib.h>\fP.
.SH BUGS
In glibc 2.4 and earlier, it was not possible to specify
.I prev
as NULL.
Consequently, to build a linear list, the caller had to build a list
using an initial call that contained the first two elements of the list,
with the forward and backward pointers in each element suitably initialized.
.SH EXAMPLE
The program below demonstrates the use of
.BR insque ().
Here is an example run of the program:
.in +4n
.nf

.RB "$ " "./a.out -c a b c"
Traversing completed list:
    a
    b
    c
That was a circular list
