.SH DESCRIPTION
These functions break the argument
.I x
into an integral
part and a fractional part, each of which has the same sign as
.IR x .
The integral part is stored in the location pointed to by
.IR iptr .
.SH RETURN VALUE
These functions return the fractional part of
.IR x .

If
.I x
is a NaN, a NaN is returned, and
.IR *iptr
is set to a NaN.

If
.I x
is positive infinity (negative infinity), +0 (\-0) is returned, and
.IR *iptr
is set to positive infinity (negative infinity).
.SH ERRORS
No errors occur.
