.TH ISWGRAPH 3  2015-08-08 "GNU" "Linux Programmer's Manual"
.SH NAME
iswgraph \- test for graphic wide character
.SH SYNOPSIS
.nf
.B #include <wctype.h>
.sp
.BI "int iswgraph(wint_t " wc );
.fi
.SH DESCRIPTION
The
.BR iswgraph ()
function is the wide-character equivalent of the
.BR isgraph (3)
function.
It tests whether
.I wc
is a wide character
belonging to the wide-character class "graph".
.PP
The wide-character class "graph" is a subclass of the wide-character class
"print".
.PP
Being a subclass of the wide-character class "print",
the wide-character class
"graph" is disjoint from the wide-character class "cntrl".
.PP
The wide-character class "graph" is disjoint from the wide-character class
"space" and therefore also disjoint from its subclass "blank".
.\" Note: UNIX98 (susv2/xbd/locale.html) says that "graph" and "space" may
.\" have characters in common, except U+0020. But C99 (ISO/IEC 9899:1999
.\" section 7.25.2.1.10) says that "space" and "graph" are disjoint.
.PP
The wide-character class "graph" contains all the wide characters from the
wide-character class "print" except the space character.
It therefore contains
the wide-character classes "alnum" and "punct".
.SH RETURN VALUE
The
.BR iswgraph ()
function returns nonzero
if
.I wc
is a wide character
belonging to the wide-character class "graph".
Otherwise, it returns zero.
.SH ATTRIBUTES
