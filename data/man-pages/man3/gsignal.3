.SH DESCRIPTION
Don't use these functions under Linux.
Due to a historical mistake, under Linux these functions are
aliases for
.BR raise (3)
and
.BR signal (2),
respectively.
.LP
Elsewhere, on System V-like systems, these functions implement
software signaling, entirely independent of the classical
.BR signal (2)
and
.BR kill (2)
functions.
The function
.BR ssignal ()
defines the action to take when the software signal with
number
.I signum
is raised using the function
.BR gsignal (),
and returns the previous such action or
.BR SIG_DFL .
The function
.BR gsignal ()
does the following: if no action (or the action
.BR SIG_DFL )
was
specified for
.IR signum ,
then it does nothing and returns 0.
If the action
.B SIG_IGN
was specified for
.IR signum ,
then it does nothing and returns 1.
Otherwise, it resets the action to
.B SIG_DFL
and calls
the action function with argument
.IR signum ,
and returns the value returned by that function.
The range of possible values
.I signum
varies (often 1-15 or 1-17).

.SH CONFORMING TO
These functions are available under AIX, DG/UX, HP-UX, SCO, Solaris, Tru64.
They are called obsolete under most of these systems, and are
broken under Linux libc and glibc.
Some systems also have
.BR gsignal_r ()
and
.BR ssignal_r ().
