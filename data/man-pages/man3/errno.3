.SH NAME
errno \- number of last error
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B #include <errno.h>
.\".sp
.\".BI "extern int " errno ;
.SH DESCRIPTION
The
.I <errno.h>
header file defines the integer variable
.IR errno ,
which is set by system calls and some library functions in the event
of an error to indicate what went wrong.
Its value is significant only when the return value of
the call indicated an error
(i.e., \-1 from most system calls;
\-1 or NULL from most library functions);
a function that succeeds
.I is
allowed to change
.IR errno .

Valid error numbers are all nonzero;
.I errno
is never set to zero
by any system call or library function.

For some system calls and library functions (e.g.,
.BR getpriority (2)),
\-1 is a valid return on success.
In such cases, a successful return can be distinguished from an error
return by setting
.I errno
to zero before the call, and then,
if the call returns a status that indicates that an error
may have occurred, checking to see if
.I errno
has a nonzero value.

.I errno
is defined by the ISO C standard to be a modifiable lvalue
of type
.IR int ,
and must not be explicitly declared;
.I errno
may be a macro.
.I errno
is thread-local; setting it in one thread
does not affect its value in any other thread.

All the error names specified by POSIX.1
must have distinct values, with the exception of
.B EAGAIN
and
.BR EWOULDBLOCK ,
which may be the same.

.\" The following is now
.\" POSIX.1 (2001 edition) lists the following symbolic error names.  Of
.\" these, \fBEDOM\fP and \fBERANGE\fP are in the ISO C standard.  ISO C
.\" Amendment 1 defines the additional error number \fBEILSEQ\fP for
.\" coding errors in multibyte or wide characters.
.\"
Below is a list of the symbolic error names that are defined on Linux.
Some of these are marked
.IR POSIX.1 ,
indicating that the name is defined by POSIX.1-2001, or
.\" FIXME This list should be updated for POSIX.1-2008
.IR C99 ,
indicating that the name is defined by C99.

.SH NOTES
A common mistake is to do
.in +4n
.nf

if (somecall() == \-1) {
    printf("somecall() failed\en");
    if (errno == ...) { ... }
}

.fi
.in
where
.I errno
no longer needs to have the value it had upon return from
.IR somecall ()
(i.e., it may have been changed by the
.BR printf (3)).
If the value of
.I errno
should be preserved across a library call, it must be saved:
.in +4n
.nf

if (somecall() == \-1) {
    int errsv = errno;
    printf("somecall() failed\en");
    if (errsv == ...) { ... }
}
.fi
.in
.PP
It was common in traditional C to declare
.I errno
manually
(i.e.,
.IR "extern int errno" )
instead of including
.IR <errno.h> .
.BR "Do not do this" .
It will not work with modern versions of the C library.
However, on (very) old UNIX systems, there may be no
.I <errno.h>
and the declaration is needed.
