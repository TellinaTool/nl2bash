Global changes
--------------

Various pages
    Fabian Kreutz
        Many math pages had their synopses compressed, as per suggestion
        from Fabian Kreutz.

Various pages
    Fabian Kreutz / aeb
        Many minor content and formatting bug fixes were made to the math
        pages, following suggestions from Fabian Kreutz (who recently
        translated many of the 1.70 math pages into German) and
        Andries Brouwer.

Various pages
    mtk
        For consistency, all instances of "super-user" were changed
        to the more common "superuser".

Various pages
    Vasya Pupkin / mtk
        After a note from Vasya Pupkin, I added <errno.h> to the SYNOPSIS
        of several Section 2 pages using the _syscallN() macros.

        In addition:
            -- erroneous semicolons at the end of _syscallN() were removed
               on various pages.

            -- types such as "uint" in syscallN() declarations were changed
               to "unsigned int", etc.

            -- various other minor breakages in the synopses were fixed.

        The affected pages are:

                getdents.2
                gettid.2
                llseek.2
                mmap2.2
                modify_ldt.2
                pivot_root.2
                quotactl.2
                readdir.2
                sysctl.2
                syslog.2
                tkill.2

Typographical or grammatical errors have been corrected in several
other places.

initgroups.3
mkstemp.3

readdir.3
telldir.3
    Matthew Dempsky, mtk
        triggered by http://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=283179
        The wording describing how errno is set was fixed up in these pages.

Typographical or grammatical errors have been corrected in several
other places.

Changes to individual pages
---------------------------

sendfile.2
    mtk
        Adjusted descriptions of argument file types to be closer to
        2.6 reality.
        Wording and formatting changes.

ctan.3
ctanh.3
    Tony Crawford
        As per http://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=270817
        Formulae on the pages should be T = S / C not T = C / S.

errno.3
    Martin Schulze, mtk
        Removed errno declaration from prototype, added notes
        on historical need for this declaration.
        http://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=174175

aio_return.3
    as per http://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=224953
        Changed erroneous "aio_return(2)" to "aio_return(3)".

posix_openpt.3
    mtk
        New by mtk

ptsname.3
    mtk
        Added description of ptsname_r().
        Added ERRORS.

ptsname_r.3
    mtk
        New link to ptsname.3.

shm_open.3
    Matthew Gregan
        add <fcntl.h> to synopsis
        as per http://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=271243

strcasecmp.3
    Marek Habersack
            .SH "CONFORMING TO"
            -BSD 4.4
            +BSD 4.4, SUSv3
        as per http://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=234443

strfry.3
    Joshua Kwan
        Added _GNU_SOURCE to prototype
        as per http://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=213538

strftime.3
    Cartsen Hey
        as per http://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=276248

        Changed range for "%S" from 0..61 to 0..60.

        SUSv3 says 0..60.  I think the manual page probably says
        0..61, because that's what SUSv2 said.
        (Some other implementations' man pages also say 0..61 --
        e.g., Solaris 8 & 9, Tru64 5.1B; FreeBSD 5.1 says 0..60.)

        The glibc manual currently says 0..60.

        Given that SUSv3 says 0..60, I've changed the
        manual page to also say this:

            -The second as a decimal number (range 00 to 61).
            +The second as a decimal number (range 00 to 60).
            +(The range is up to 60 to allow for occasional leap seconds.)

sysconf.3
    Johannes Berg
        See http://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=226974
        -.BR POSIX2_FORT_RUN " - " _SC_2_FORT_DEV
        +.BR POSIX2_FORT_DEV " - " _SC_2_FORT_DEV

system.3
    Pedro Zorzenon
        as per http://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=242638
        Noted use of _XOPEN_SOURCE to get macros from <stdlib.h>
        for wait(2).

    mtk
        Changed name of argument from 'string' to 'command' (like POSIX).

        Noted that glibc does nowadays explicitly check for the existence
        of the shell if 'command' is NULL, rather than the older behavior
        of assuming the shell exists and always returning 1 if
        'command' is NULL.

        Other wording and formatting clean-ups.

undocumented.3
    Remove some functions names that *are* documented.

    Martin (Joey) Schulze
        Removed SEE ALSO reference to nonexistent newctime(3).
        See http://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=236884

Typographical or grammatical errors have been corrected in several
other places.

Changes to individual pages

epoll_create.2
    Marko Kohtala  / mtk
        Improved various error descriptions.

epoll_wait.2
    David Lloyd / Mike Frysinger, Marko Kohtala
        Added EINTR to errors.

fcntl.2
    Jamie Lokier / mtk
        Improved discussion of F_SETOWN and F_SETSIG with respect to
        multi-threaded programs.
        Generally cleaned up the discussion of F_SETOWN.

        Updated CONFORMING TO to note that F_GETOWN and F_SETOWN are
        now in POSIX.

link.2
    mtk
        Noted discrepancy between Linux and POSIX.1 when oldpath
        is a symbolic link.
        See: http://bugs.linuxbase.org/show_bug.cgi?id=367
        and: http://www.opengroup.org/austin/mailarchives/ag/msg08152.html

    Michael Haardt / mtk
        Clarified EXDEV error description: it isn't possible to link
        across mount points, even if the mount points refer to the same
        file system.

mincore.2
    mtk, after note from Gordon Jin
        Updated ERRORS.

pipe.2
    As per message from Serguei Leontiev
        Removed SVr2, AT&T, and BSD from CONFORMING TO, since
        a pipe on those systems is actually bidirectional.
        (Pipes are implemented as STREAMS on the former, and
        sockets on the latter.)

posix_fadvise.2
    mtk
        Noted kernel version where posix_fadvise() appeared and
        noted bug in handling of 'len' in kernels < 2.6.6.

        the same file system.

semop.2
    mtk
        Noted kernel version numbers for semtimedop().

    Johan Walles, Martin (Joey) Schulze
        Added sigqueue.2 to SEE ALSO.

times.2
    mtk
        Added notes on non-standard behavior: Linux allows 'buf' to
        be NULL, but POSIX.1 doesn't specify this and it's non-portable.

uselib.2
    Andries Brouwer
        Improved DESCRIPTION; clarified distinction between
        EACCES and ENOEXEC.

bcopy.3
    Heikki Orsila
        bcopy() handles overlapping case, but memcpy() does not,
        so for consistency memmove() should be also mentioned.

getmntent_r.3
    Martin (Joey) Schulze
        New link to man3/getmntent.3.

memcpy.3
    Small wording change after suggestion from Sasa Stevanovic.

        Improved description of read from /dev/urandom.

st.4
    Kai Makisara
        Substantial updates.

==================== Changes in man-pages-2.10 ====================

Released: 2005-10-19

Global changes
--------------

The changes in this release consist *solely* of formatting fixes, with
the aim bringing greater consistency to the manual pages according to
the following rules:

-- Function name references should *always* be followed by
   parentheses, "()" (possibly containing a manual page section
   number).

-- The parentheses following a function name should *not* be
   formatted.  Thus, for example, instead of:

       .B name()

   one should write:

       .BR name ()

Much of the change was automated using two scripts:
add_parens_for_own_funcs.sh and unformat_parens.sh.
For the (possible) benefit of downstream manual page maintainers and
translators, I have placed these scripts in a new subdirectory 'scripts'.

NOTE THE FOLLOWING POINTS WELL:

-- These scripts provide a computer-assisted solution to the above
   two goals.  However, they are not perfect, and their output should
   be scanned by a human.  (To see what changes the two scripts
   *would* make, without making them, use the "-n" command line option.)

-- The scripts do not fix all instances that violate the above rules:
   some manual fixes are required.  Two further scripts are provided
   to help find remaining instances of function names without
   following "()": find_dots_no_parens.sh and find_slashes_no_parens.sh.

The following changes were made:

-- add_parens_for_own_funcs.sh was applied to the pages in Sections
   2 and 3.

-- unformat_parens.sh was applied to pages in Sections 2, 3, 4, and 7
   (the only sections where such changes were required).

-- further changes (not so very many) were performed by hand.
   (found places to fix with the assistance of find_dots_no_parens.sh
   and find_slashes_no_parens.sh).

Various pages
    mtk
        Most instances of the constant "NULL" are not formatted (bolded) in
        man pages, but a few are.  For consistency, formatting on "NULL" has
        been removed where it occurred.

        Many minor formatting fixes were made.

Typographical or grammatical errors have been corrected in several
places.


Changes to individual pages
---------------------------

getrlimit.2
    mtk
        Added EINVAL error for rlim_cur > rlim_max when calling setrlimit().

        Repaired discussion of capabilities and file system UID, which
        mistakenly had involved exec() in the discussion.

prctl.2
    mtk
        Removed text saying there is no library interface.  There
        is nowadays.

mkfifo.3
    mtk

        sysconf(_SC_PAGESIZE) can be used.

path_resolution.2
    mtk / aeb
        Removed words "as well" (added in 2.11) from the phrase
        "and it gets these last five capabilities if its fsuid is 0 as well"
        since there are (unusual) situations in which fsuid can be 0 while
        the effective UID is not.

        Reworked (cut down) discussion of capabilities, moving part of
        it into capabilities.7

setresuid.2
    mtk
        Add text to note that setresuid() always modifies the file
        system UID, and setresgid() likewise always modifies the file
        system GID.

        Added (brief) description of SHM_HUGETLB.

sigaltstack.2
    mtk / Martin Landers

    Brian M. Carlson  / herbert
        Change <netinet/in.h> to <arpa/inet.h> in prototype; add text
        explaining that some systems need the former header.
        As per http://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=265244

capabilities.7
    mtk
        Reworked part of the discussion of exec() and capabilities.
        Added sub-section "Effect of User ID Changes on Capabilities".
        Reworked discussion of CAP_SYS_ADMIN and file-max.


==================== Changes in man-pages-2.13 ====================

Released: 2005-11-03

This release consists entirely of formatting and typographical fixes.

Global changes
--------------

Typographical or grammatical errors have been corrected in several
places.

Various pages
    mtk
        Function and page cross references that were italicized were
        made bold (which is how the majority of function and page
        cross references were already done).

Various pages
    mtk
        Instances of things like "NULL-terminated string" were changed to
        "null-terminated string".

Various pages
    mtk
        Pathnames, structures, arguments, and <header-files> that were
        bold were changed to italics.

Various pages
    mtk
        Instances of the constant "NULL" that were bold-faced were made
        unformatted (which is how most instances of "NULL" were already
        formatted.)

Global changes
--------------

Typographical or grammatical errors have been corrected in several
places.

New pages
---------

rexec.3
    mtk / Justin Pryzby
        This page is taken as is from the FreeBSD 5.4 distribution.
        (Not checked against Linux reality, but likely things are
        the same.)
        See also http://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=336875

Changes to individual pages
---------------------------

arch_prctl.2
    mtk
        Updated discussion about lack of prototype in glibc.

execve.2
    mtk
        Improved description of E2BIG error: it relates to the sum
        of the bytes in both environment and argument list.

fcntl.2
    mtk
        Clarified parts of the discussion of file leases,
        noting effect of open(O_NONBLOCK), interruption
        by signal handler, or termination by signal in
        lease breaker.  In response to
        http://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=339037

stat.2
    mtk / Stefan Brüns
        Added LINUX NOTES describing nanosecond timestamps.

frexp.3
    Volker Reichelt / mtk
        Fixed to point out that frexp() returns a number whose
        *absolute* value is >= 0.5 and < 1.  Amended the example
        program to demonstrate this.

open.2
    mtk / Avery Pennarun
        Add EWOULDBLOCK error for file leases.
        In response to
        http://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=339037

putenv.3
    mtk
        Although the glibc implementation returns -1 on error (and some
        other man pages (e.g., the BSDs) also document that value for
        error returns), SUSv3 merely says "non-zero" (and this is
        what manual pages on many implementations also say).

posix_memalign.3
    mtk
        Formerly, the page said that all systems declare memalign() in
        <malloc.h>.  In fact, many declare it in <stdlib.h>.

strtok.3
    mtk
        Almost a complete rewrite after Angelo pointed out
        that the existing page was deficient.

sd.4
    Martin Schulze
        Remove SEE ALSO for nonexistent scsi.4.

proc.5
    mtk
        Updated discussion of /proc/sys/kernel/pid_max.

signal.7
    mtk
        Added pthreads.7 to SEE ALSO.

Global changes
--------------

Most pages
    mtk
        There was a major reworking of the CONFORMING TO sections
        in most manual pages.

        * generally try to rationalize the names used for standards.
          The preferred names are now documented as the head words
          of the list in standards(7).  For the future: there is
          probably no need to talk about anything more than
          C89, C99, POSIX.1-2001 (or later), xBSD, and SVr4.
          (In particular, I've eliminated most references to XPG
          and SVID, replacing them with references to SUS or SVr4.)

        * eliminate discussion of errors that can occur on other
          systems.  This information exists only patchily in the
          manual pages, is probably of limited use, is hard to maintain,
          and was in some cases simply wrong (and probably always was).

        * Tried to ensure that those interfaces specified in C99 or
          POSIX.1-2001 are marked as such in their manual pages.

intro.1
intro.2
intro.3
intro.4
intro.5

Typographical or grammatical errors have been corrected in several

rtc.4
    David Brownell

        Update the RTC man page to reflect the new RTC class framework:

        - Generalize ... it's not just for PC/AT style RTCs, and there
          may be more than one RTC per system.

        - Not all RTCs expose the same feature set as PC/AT ones; most
          of these ioctls will be rejected by some RTCs.

        - Be explicit about when {A,P}IE_{ON,OFF} calls are needed.

        - Describe the parameter to the get/set epoch request; correct
          the description of the get/set frequency parameter.

        - Document RTC_WKALM_{RD,SET}, which don't need AIE_{ON,OFF} and
          which support longer alarm periods.

        - Hey, not all system clock implementations count timer irqs any
          more now that the new RT-derived clock support is merging.

places.  (Special thanks to Nicolas François!)


Changes to individual pages
---------------------------

access.2
    mtk
        Since 2.6.20, access() honors the MS_NOEXEC mount flag.
    Jorge Peixoto de Morais Neto / mtk
        Improve ENOENT description.

clone.2
    mtk
        Added some detail to the prototype.
        Added some notes on IA-64's clone2().

epoll_ctl.2
    mtk
        Add text to note that EPOLLRDHUP appeared in kernel 2.6.17.

faccessat.2
    Justin Pryzby
        Various fixes as per
        http://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=411177
        * s/effective/real/ in description text.
        * added <fcntl.h> to synopsis.
        * various other changes.

getrlimit.2
    mtk / Fedora downstream patches; thanks to Ivana Varekova
        Added a few words to note that RLIMIT_NPROC is really a limit on
        threads.

io_cancel.2
io_destroy.2
io_getevents.2
io_setup.2
io_submit.2
    Fedora downstream patches; thanks to Ivana Varekova
        s%linux/aio.h%libaio.h% in SYNOPSIS.
        Changed return type from "long" to "int".

mbind.2
    Samuel Thibault / mtk
        Fix EINVAL description.
        See http://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=411777

mincore.2
    Nick Piggin
        Kernel 2.6.21 fixes several earlier bugs in mincore().
    Nick Pollitt
        Remove words "of a file" -- mincore() is describing
        memory residence information, not properties of a file.
    mtk
        Rewrote various parts to make the page clearer.

mmap.2
    mtk
        Rewrote and reorganized various parts to be clearer.
    Taken from Fedora downstream patches; thanks to Ivana Varekova
        Removed text stating that mmap() never returns 0; that's
        not true.

mount.2
    mtk / Val Henson
        Document MS_RELATIME, new in Linux 2.6.20.

open.2
    Andre Majorel / mtk
        On Linux, the error returned when opening a large file on a
        32-bit system is actually EFBIG, not EOVERFLOW.

posix_fadvise.2
    Pádraig Brady
        Fix RETURN VALUE description: returns error number of failure.

rename.2
    mtk / Timo Sirainen
        Various improvements to DESCRIPTION.
        See http://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=416012

semop.2
    mtk
        If sops contains multiple operations, then these are performed
        in array order.  All Unix systems that I know of do this,
        and some Linux applications depend on this behavior.  SUSv3
        made no explicit statement here, but SUSv4 will explicitly
        require this behavior.
        Small rewording of explanation of "atomically".

signal.2
    Nicolas François
        Fix incorrect argument name in DESCRIPTION.
    mtk
        Small wording improvement.

socket.2
    Nicolas François
        Add reference to ipv6.7 page.

socketcall.2
    Nicolas François
        Fix .TH line.

splice.2
    Benjamin Gilbert
        Fix inconsistent argument names in SYNOPSIS and DESCRIPTION.

statvfs.2
    mtk
        Small wording clarification.

symlink.2
    mtk / Nicolas François
        Removed cryptic text under CONFORMING to referring to
        "open(2) and NFS".  There is no relevant text in open.2 as
        far as I (mtk) can see.

time.2
    mtk / Reuben Thomas
        Remove sentence "gettimeofday() obsoleting time() on 4.3BSD".
        This information is old, and probably no longer relevant.
        See http://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=403888

write.2
    mtk, after an idea from a downstream Fedora patch.
        Clarified discussion of /count == 0/ case.

ptrace.2
    Chuck Ebbert
        When the parent receives an event with PTRACE_EVENT_* set,
        the child is not in the normal signal delivery path.  This
        means the parent cannot do ptrace(PTRACE_CONT) with a signal
        or ptrace(PTRACE_KILL).  kill() with a SIGKILL signal can be
        used instead to kill the child process after receiving one
        of these messages.

sched_setaffinity.2
    mtk
        Fix glibc version number in description of 'cpusetsize' argument.

vfork.2
    mtk
        Stripped some excess/outdated text from the BUGS section.

basename.3
    mtk / Jorge Peixoto de Morais Neto
        Add text to clarify that the pointer returned by these
        functions may be into some part of 'path'.

dlopen.3
    Taken from Fedora downstream patches; thanks to Ivana Varekova
    + Carlo Marcelo Arenas Belon
        Add "#include <stdlib.h>" to example program.

fclose.3
    mtk
        Complete rewrite.  The existing page was hard to read,
        and the RETURN VALUE description seems to be wrong.

getopt.3
    mtk
        Added getopt() example program.
    mtk
        Add a few words to clarify the operation of the GNU-specific
        double-colon feature, which allows options to have optional
        arguments.
        See http://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=352139

glob.3
    Nicolas François
        Fix PROTOTYPE.

inet_network.3
    mtk, after an idea from a downstream Fedora patch.
        Clarified description of inet_network().

log.3
    Nicolas François
        Fix .TH line.

log10.3
    Nicolas François
        Fix .TH line.

malloc.3
    Nicolas François
        Small rewording to mention calloc().

posix_openpt.3
    Martín Ferrari
        Fix return type in SYNOPSIS; as per
        http://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=400971
        Needs _XOPEN_SOURCE == 600; as per
        http://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=400975
    Julien BLACHE
        s/ptsname/posix_openpt/ in RETURN VALUE

re_comp.3
    Taken from Fedora downstream patches; thanks to Ivana Varekova
        Add "#define _REGEX_RE_COMP" to SYNOPSIS.

regex.3
    Nicolas François
        Fix .TH line.

termios.3
    mtk
        Added .SS headers to give some structure to this page; and a small
        amount of reordering.
    mtk
        Added a section on canonical and non-canonical mode.
    mtk
        Enhanced the discussion of "raw" mode for cfmakeraw().
    mtk
        Document CMSPAR.
    mtk
        Make description of PARODD a little clearer.
    Reuben Thomas
        Add SEE ALSO link to tty_ioctl.4
    mtk
        Add SEE ALSO link to console_ioctl.4

ualarm.3
    mtk
        Removed BSD prototype from synopsis.
        Various rewordings.

usleep.3
    mtk
        Removed BSD prototype from synopsis.
        Various rewordings.

    Taken from Fedora downstream patches; thanks to Ivana Varekova
        s/curses/ncurses/ under SEE ALSO

bootparam.7
    Taken from Fedora downstream patches; thanks to Ivana Varekova
        Documented "mem=nopentium".

feature_test_macros.7
    mtk
        The default treatment of _POSIX_C_SOURCE changed in glibc 2.4.
    mtk, after a suggestion by Justin Pryzby
        Added some text warning that the "__" macros that
        <features.h> defines internally should never be
        directly defined by programs.
    mtk, based on notes by Jakub Jelinek
        Document _FORTIFY_SOURCE
        (See http://gcc.gnu.org/ml/gcc-patches/2004-09/msg02055.html )
    mtk
        Document _REENTRANT and _THREAD_SAFE.

mdoc.7
    mtk / Nicolas François
        Remove CONFIGURATION section, since this does not seem to be
        true for Linux.

svipc.7
    Nicolas François
        Fix data types in associated data structures;
        remove nonexistent semzcnt and semncnt fields.

time.7
    mtk
        Since kernel 2.6.20, the software clock can also be 300 HZ.

        Bug filed (http://bugzilla.kernel.org/show_bug.cgi?id=8408)

==================== Changes in man-pages-2.50 ====================

Released: 2007-05-21

Contributors
------------

The following people contributed notes, ideas, or patches that have
been incorporated in changes in this release:

Andreas Halter <halter@google.com>
Laird Shaw <netocrat@dodo.com.au>
Mike Frysinger <vapier@gentoo.org>

Apologies if I missed anyone!

Removed pages (!)
-----------------

Most Section 1 man pages are removed
    mtk (with help from Mike Frysinger, Laird Shaw, Andreas Halter)
        Once upon time Andries added a number of Section 1 manual pages
        to man-pages.  However, since that time, those pages have not
        seen much maintenance, and are not in fact distributed in most
        distributions.  Instead most distributions supply the
        coreutils versions of these pages, which are currently
        maintained.  In addition, man-pages provides the 1p pages,
        which document the portable subset of functionality of these
        commands.  Since the man1 pages are mostly unneeded, and
        out of date, I'm removing them.  The following pages disappear:

            chgrp.1
            chmod.1
            chown.1
            cp.1
            dd.1
            df.1
            diff.1
            dir.1
            dircolors.1
            du.1
            install.1
            ln.1
            ls.1
            mkdir.1
            mkfifo.1
            mknod.1
            mv.1
            rm.1
            rmdir.1
            touch.1
            vdir.1

        The following Section 1 pages will be kept:

            intro.1
            ldd.1
            time.1


==================== Changes in man-pages-2.51 ====================

Released: 2007-05-28

Global changes
--------------

Various pages

        Convert function formatting of the form "\fBname\fP()" to
        ".BR name ()".

==================== Changes in man-pages-2.52 ====================

Released: 2007-05-29

    "A foolish consistency is the hobgoblin of little minds, adored by
     little statesmen and philosophers and divines"

        Ralph Waldo Emerson (1803-1882)

    "But damn it, these man pages are a mess!"

        Reason: consistency.

Various pages
    mtk
        Some .SH header lines were made into .SS lines.  (One of the aims
        here is to reduce the number of non-standard .SH lines.)

Various pages
    mtk
        Change title .SH sections named "NOTE" to "NOTES", in some cases
        also changing the location of the section within the page.
        Reason: consistency.

Various pages
    mtk
        Commented out .SH AUTHOR sections; the right place for
        documentation authorship sections is usually comments at the
        top of the page source.

Various pages
    mtk
        Changed .SH HISTORY to .SH VERSIONS.
        Reason: in many cases, HISTORY was being used to describe
        Linux/glibc version information, as was already done for
        VERSIONS sections in other pages.

Various pages
    mtk
        Removed HISTORY section, or moved it as a subsection or paragraphs
        under another section e.g., NOTES.
        Reason: there are too many arbitrary section (.SH) names, and
        a HISTORY section never was consistently used across Linux
        manual pages.

Various pages
    mtk
        Moved SEE ALSO section to be last section on the page
        Reason: consistency -- and this is where SEE ALSO should be!

Various pages
    mtk
        Relocated GLIBC NOTES as subsection under NOTES
        Reason: reduce number of arbitrary section (.SH) names.

Various pages
    mtk
        Relocated LINUX NOTES as subsection under NOTES
        Reason: reduce number of arbitrary section (.SH) names.

Various pages
    mtk
        Renamed some "AVAILABILITY" sections to "VERSIONS".
        Reason: consistency.

Various pages
    mtk
        Renamed some "DIAGNOSTICS" sections to "RETURN VALUE".
        Reason: consistency.

getopt.3
tzselect.8
    mtk
        s/\.SH ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES/.SH ENVIRONMENT/
        Reason: consistency.

intro.2
select.2
sysctl.2

getgrent_r.3
getgrouplist.3
getpwent_r.3

strptime.3
tsearch.3
vcs.4
wordexp.3
    mtk
        s/return 0/exit(EXIT_FAILURE)/ in main() of function example
        program.
        Reason: consistency.

mprotect.2
select_tut.2
dlopen.3
getgrent_r.3
getopt.3
getpwent_r.3
hsearch.3
select_tut.2
tsearch.3
    mtk
        Use symbolic constants (EXIT_SUCCESS, EXIT_FAILURE) in calls
        to exit().
        Reason: consistency.

access.2
chown.2
lseek.2
open.2
read.2
utmp.5
    mtk
        Renamed RESTRICTIONS section to NOTES, or moved text in a
        RESTRICTIONS section under existing NOTES section.
        Reason: consistency, and reduce number of arbitrary section (.SH)
        names.


Changes to individual pages
---------------------------

capget.2
    mtk
        s/\.SH FURTHER INFORMATION/.SH NOTES/

dup.2
    mtk
        s/\.SH WARNING/.SH NOTES/

kill.2
    mtk
        Renamed LINUX HISTORY section to LINUX NOTES, and relocated
        within page.

select_tut.2
    mtk
        Relocated example program and made its .SH title "EXAMPLE".

sigaltstack.2
    mtk
        Move code example into its own EXAMPLE section.

sigreturn.2
    mtk
        s/\.SH WARNING/.SH NOTES/

setuid.2
    mtk
        s/\.SH "LINUX-SPECIFIC REMARKS"/.SH LINUX NOTES/

shmget.2
    mtk
        Remove section about effect of fork()/exec()/exit(); shmop.2
        contains the same text, and it only needs to be said once.

shmop.2
    mtk
        Minor rewording under DESCRIPTION.

daemon.3
    mtk
        Minor wording and formatting changes.

encrypt.3
    mtk
        Removed statement that glibc unconditionally exposes declarations
        of encrypt() and setkey(), since portable applications must
        use <unistd.h> and define _XOPEN_SOURCE to obtain the declarations
        of setkey() and encrypt().  Adjusted example program accordingly.

mkstemp.3
    mtk
        Slight rewording.

LDP.7
    mtk
        Minor wording and formatting changes.

man.7
    mtk
        Substantial rewrite, revising and extending the discussion
        about desired conventions for writing pages.
        There will be further updates to this page in the next few
        man-pages releases.


==================== Changes in man-pages-2.53 ====================

Released: 2007-05-30

    "A foolish consistency is the hobgoblin of little minds, adored by
     little statesmen and philosophers and divines"

        Ralph Waldo Emerson (1803-1882)

    "But damn it, these man pages are a mess!"


Global changes
--------------

Many many pages
    mtk
        Reordered sections to be more consistent, in some cases renaming
        sections or shifting paragraphs between sections.

man7/*
    mtk
        In various pages in this section, .SH headings were
        converted to .SS.


==================== Changes in man-pages-2.54 ====================

The following people contributed notes, ideas, or patches that have
been incorporated in changes in this release:

Emmanuel Mogenet <emogenet@google.com>
Michael Berg <michaeljberg@gmail.com>

Apologies if I missed anyone!


Global changes
--------------

Various pages
    mtk
        Where there is an instruction in the SYNOPSIS about linking
        or compiling with a certain option, the option is now
        marked up in italics (e.g., "\fI-lm\fP").

Various pages
    mtk
        Added page numbers to page cross references.

A few pages
    mtk
        s/manpage/man page/, for consistency.

Typographical or grammatical errors have been corrected in several
places.


New pages
---------

man-pages.7
    mtk
        A description of the conventions that should be followed
        when writing pages for the man-pages package.

Removed pages
-------------

man1/README
    mtk
        Already deleted most of the man1 pages previously, so
        this doesn't need to stay.

LDP.7
    mtk
        Removed this page since it is out of date, and the proper place
        to go for up-to-date information is http://www.tldp.org/

ksoftirq.9
    mtk
        Reason: this was the only Section 9 page, and it is old
        (Linux 2.4).  The man9 section never took off as an idea, and
        I see little point in keeping a Section 9 with just a single
        old page.


Changes to individual pages
---------------------------

HOWTOHELP
    mtk
        Moved some material out of here into new man-pages.7.

alloc_hugepages.2
    mtk
        Minor rewrites, eliminating some duplication, and removing
        some outdated text.

epoll_pwait.2
    Michael Berg
        Fix broken link path;
        http://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=425570

fcntl.2
    mtk
        Remove misleading text about setting O_ASYNC when calling
        open(); one must use fcntl() F_SETFL for this task.

fdatasync.2
    mtk
        Converted outdated BUGS note about fdatasync() being
        equivalent to fsync() on Linux 2.2 into a NOTES note
        about this historical behavior.

futex.2
    mtk
        Small rewording to fix "fails with the error EWOULDBLOCK"
        rather than "returns EWOULDBLOCK".
        See Red Hat bug 172828.

mprotect.2
    mtk, after an observation by Emmanuel Mogenet
        A much improved example program.
    mtk
        Significant rewrites and additions to description.

        much information, in my opinion.

sched_yield.2
    mtk
        Added ERRORS section.

set_mempolicy.2
    mtk
        Moved text for "Versions and Library Support".

set_tid_address.2
    mtk
        Small rewording in RETURN VALUE section.

sigaction.2
    mtk
        Add EXAMPLE section with a pointer to example in mprotect.2.

        Rewrite and substantial additional text.

exec.3
    mtk
        Minor clarifications for text on execlp() and execvp().  Removed
        FILES section, since it provides no useful additional info.

fenv.3
    mtk
        Moved link instructions from NOTES to SYNOPSIS.
        Added feenableexcept, fedisableexcept, fegetexcept
        to .SH NAME list.

fputwc.3
    mtk
        Added 'putwc' to .SH NAME list.

gethostbyname.3
    mtk
        s/int/socklen_t/ for type of gethostbyaddr() 'len' argument,
        and add a few more words in NOTES about the type used here.

login.3
    mtk
        Removed remark from NOTES about linking with -lutil; add
        text on that point to SYNOPSIS.

openpty.3
    mtk
        Removed redundant remark from NOTES about linking with -lutil
        since there is text on that point under SYNOPSIS.

sysconf.3
    mtk
        Added SEE ALSO referring to getconf(1).

unlocked_stdio.3
    mtk
        Revised .SH NAME section.

ascii.7
    mtk
        Minor rearrangement of order of text.

capabilities.7
    mtk
        s/exec()/execve(2)/ in various places.

complex.7
    mtk
        Changed "atan(1)" to "atan(1.0)" to prevent some versions of
        man2html(1) from mistaking that string as a page cross reference.

rtnetlink.7
    mtk
        Small restructuring to avoid 'cannot adjust line' from man(1).

ldconfig.8
    mtk
        Removed now very out-of-date sentence about need to link shared
        libraries with -lc.

man.7
    mtk
        Various text was moved out of this page into the new man-pages.7.

mdoc.7
    mtk
        Added SEE ALSO referring to new man-pages.7.

mdoc.samples.7
    mtk
        A few changes, hopefully done right, to eliminate some
        errors to stderr when rendering with man(1).

rtnetlink.7
    mtk
        Shorten a line in table so it fits in 80 columns.
        Minor rewording under BUGS.

tzselect.8
    mtk
        Moved EXIT STATUS section.

        have gone away,

Several pages
    mtk
        Change reference to path_resolution.2 to path_resolution.7.

Typographical or grammatical errors have been corrected in several
places.


Moved pages
-----------

path_resolution.2 has been moved to section 7, thus path_resolution.7
    mtk
        Reason: this is an overview page, not one describing as
        a specific system call.


Changes to individual pages
---------------------------

        Added pointer to Red Hat man-pages bugzilla.

==================== Changes in man-pages-2.56 ====================

Released: 2007-06-11

Global changes
--------------

Many pages
    mtk
        Removed version numbers in .TH lines.
        Reason: these were only arbitrarily updated, and so impart no
        useful information.  Version information goes into a
        VERSIONS section nowadays, and the date in the .TH line should
        be updated to reflect the date of the last (significant)
        change to the page.

Typographical or grammatical errors have been corrected in several
places.

==================== Changes in man-pages-2.59 ====================

Released: 2007-06-25

Global changes
--------------

Manual pages are now standardized on American spelling.  See
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_and_British_English_spelling_differences
for more information on the differences.  Formerly, different pages (and
sometimes even a single page!) employed American and British spelling
conventions; best to standardize on one spelling, and American English
is the standard in Computer Science.

New pages
---------

sgetmask.2
    mtk
        A real man page for sgetmask(2) and ssetmask(2).
        (This page replaces a previous link of the same name, which
        linked to signal.2.)

spu_create.2
    Arnd Bergmann with additional work by Eduardo M. Fleury and mtk
        Document the PowerPC SPU spu_create() system call.
        (Originally taken from the kernel source file
        Documentation/filesystems/spufs.txt.)

        Document the PowerPC SPU spu_run() system call.

Removed Pages
-------------

__clone.2
    mtk
        This file was created by accident in 2.61, as a copy of clone.2.
        (it should have been a link to clone.2.)

obsolete.2
    mtk
        Details on this page are covered in syscalls.2 and in
        respective syscall man pages (stat.2, uname.2).

undocumented.2
    mtk
        This page is very out of date, and in any case difficult
        to maintain.  Information about undocumented system calls
        is maintained in the HOWTOHELP file, and probably in other
        places soon.

killpg.3
    mtk
        This rather incomplete page seems unnecessary since there
        is a killpg.2.

    mtk
        Update SYNOPSIS to reflect the fact that fchmod(2) and lchown(2)
        need either "#define _XOPEN_SOURCE 500" or "#define _BSD_SOURCE".
        Added an example program.

killpg.2
    mtk
        Note that killpg() is actually a library function on Linux.

mmap.2
    mtk
        Added note that glibc mmap() wrapper nowadays invokes mmap2().

mmap2.2
    Ivana Varekova / mtk
        On most platforms the unit for 'offset' is 4096 bytes, not
        the system page size.

        top of sigtimedwait().

ssetmask.2
    mtk
        Make this link point to new sgetmask.2 instead of signal.2.

stat.2
    mtk
        Add notes on the different system call interfaces that
        have appeared over time.

syscalls.2
    mtk
        A fairly substantial rewrite of this page,
        bringing it up to date with the current
        kernel version, and listing all system calls

    mtk
        Add notes on the different system call interfaces that

        Add section numbers to function names; remove some functions
        since they are documented.

proc.5
    mtk
        Update/correct text on /proc/malloc.
    mtk, after a note by Pierre Habouzit, and a few comments by Justin Pryzby
        Update description of /proc/PID/stat to match 2.6.21.
        See http://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=417933

inotify.7
    mtk
        IN_DONT_FOLLOW and IN_ONLYDIR are only available from 2.6.15.

    Stepan Kasal / mtk
        Note SIGRTMIN value depends on glibc.

Changes to individual pages
---------------------------

mq_notify.2
mq_open.2
mq_timedreceive.2
mq_timedsend.2
mq_unlink.2
    mtk
        Fix broken link

setpgid.2
    mtk
        Fairly substantial changes and corrections, including adding
        coverage of all of the interfaces that get/set PGIDs.

syscalls.2
    mtk / aeb
        Various rewordings; clear up some imprecisions.

lgamma.3
    mtk
        Added 'signgam' to SYNOPSIS and NAME line.

strerror.3
    mtk
        Note that the XPG version is provided since glibc 2.3.4.
        The page formerly said that the GNU-specific version
        is provided by default.  That certainly isn't true
        nowadays, since _POSIX_C_SOURCE is set to 200112L by
        default, so that the XSI-compliant version is supplied
        by default.

man-pages.7
    mtk
        Added note pointing to feature_test_macros.7 for a description
        of how feature test macro requirements should be specified in
        manual pages.  Various other minor fixes and changes.

feature_test_macros.7
    mtk
        Added note about how feature test macros are specified
        in manual pages.
        Many other corrections, improvements, additions, and
        details about differences across glibc versions.

--------------

Typographical or grammatical errors have been corrected in several
places.

Various pages
    mtk
        Use 'glibc' consistently to refer to GNU C library.

Various pages
    mtk
        Order errors under ERRORS alphabetically.

Various pages
    Nicolas François
        Spelling and formatting fixes, as per
        http://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=439560

intro.2
select.2
fmtmsg.3
getgrent_r.3
envz_add.3
rtime.3
strptime.3
wordexp.3
    Maxime Vaudequin
        Add "#include <stdlib.h>" (to declare exit(3)) to example program.


New pages
---------

timeradd.3
    mtk
        Description of timeradd(), timersub(), timerclear(),
        timerisset(), timercmp() macros for operating on
        struct timeval.


Removed pages
-------------

fdatasync.2
    mtk
        Somehow, over time, material on fdatasync(2) crept into
        fsync.2, and fdatasync also got added to the NAME section
        of fsync.2.  All of the material in fdatasync.2 that was
        not already in fsync.2 has now been moved there, and
        the former page has been removed.
        In place of the content there, is now a link to fsync.2.


New links
---------

clock_getres.2
clock_gettime.2
clock_settime.2
    mtk
        Link to man3/clock_getres.3.

Changes to individual pages
---------------------------

Makefile
    Mike Frysinger
        Make the install target of man-pages respect the standard
        "DESTDIR" variable as well as check the exit status of the
        install command so errors aren't ignored.

get_mempolicy.2
    Lee Schermerhorn
        changed the "policy" parameter to "mode" through out the
        descriptions in an attempt to promote the concept that the memory
        policy is a tuple consisting of a mode and optional set of nodes.

        added requirement to link '-lnuma' to synopsis

        rewrite portions of description for clarification.

        added all errors currently returned by sys call.

        removed cautionary note that use of MPOL_F_NODE|MPOL_F_ADDR
        is not supported.  This is no longer true.

        added mmap(2) to SEE ALSO list.

getitimer.2
    mtk
        Since kernel 2.6.22, Linux setitimer() now conforms to POSIX.1,
        giving an EINVAL error for a non-canonical tv_usec value.

gettimeofday.2
    mtk
        Replace discussion of timer* macros with a pointer
        to new page timeradd.3.

ioctl_list.2
    Nicolas George
        Fixed argument type for BLKGETSIZE.

mbind.2
    Lee Schermerhorn

        changed the "policy" parameter to "mode" throughout the
        descriptions in an attempt to promote the concept that the memory
        policy is a tuple consisting of a mode and optional set of nodes.

        rewrite portions of description for clarification.

            clarify interaction of policy with mmap()'d files and shared
            memory regions, including SHM_HUGE regions.

            defined how "empty set of nodes" specified and what this
            means for MPOL_PREFERRED.

            mention what happens if local/target node contains no
            free memory.

            clarify semantics of multiple nodes to BIND policy.
            Note:  subject to change.  We'll fix the man pages when/if
                   this happens.

        added all errors currently returned by sys call.

        added mmap(2), shmget(2), shmat(2) to SEE ALSO list.

mprotect.2
    François Diakhate
        Add text noting that PROT_WRITE may (and on x86 does)

    mtk
        Removed SEE ALSO reference to nonexistent fadvise.2.

reboot.2
    mtk
        Place SYNOPSIS comments inside C comments (/* ... */).

sched_setaffinity.2
    Samuel Thibault
        Note what thread is affected if 'pid' is specified
        as 0, or as the value returned by getpid().

sched_setscheduler.2
    Carsten Emde
        Add text on real-time features of mainline Linux kernel.

select_tut.2
    mtk
        sync SYNOPSIS with select.2

set_mempolicy.2
    Lee Schermerhorn

        changed the "policy" parameter to "mode" throughout the
        descriptions in an attempt to promote the concept that the memory
        policy is a tuple consisting of a mode and optional set of nodes.

        added requirement to link '-lnuma' to synopsis

        rewrite portions of description for clarification.

            clarify interaction of policy with mmap()'d files.

            free memory.

            clarify semantics of multiple nodes to BIND policy.
            Note:  subject to change.  We'll fix the man pages when/if
                   this happens.

        added all errors currently returned by sys call.

        added mmap(2) to SEE ALSO list.

    mtk
        Improve description of num_threads field under /proc/PID/stat.
    Maxime Vaudequin
        Fix path error (s%proc/sys%proc/sys/kernel%) in mentions of
        /proc/sys/ostype, /proc/sys/osrelease and proc/sys/version.
    Maxime Vaudequin
        I noticed things to correct and to clarify in subsection
        "/proc/filesystems" of proc.5:
        - clarify filesystems listing: not only FS compiled
          into the kernel, also FS kernel modules currently loaded
        - add a reference to fs(5)
        - add an explanation for FS marked with "nodev"
        - s/mount(1)/mount(8)/, also corrected in section "SEE ALSO"
        - clarify usage by mount: the current wording may lead to
          think /proc/filesystems is always used by mount when no FS
          is specified. So, usage of "may" which IMHO is more
          appropriate + additional explanations
          In mount(8) we can see:

               If no -t option is given, or if the auto type is
               specified, mount will try to guess the desired type.
               If mount was compiled with the blkid library, the
               guessing is done by this library. Otherwise, mount
               guesses itself by probing the superblock; if that
               does not turn up anything that looks familiar,
               mount will try to read the file /etc/filesystems,
               or, if that does not exist, /proc/filesystems.
               All of the filesystem types listed there will be
               tried, except for those that are labeled "nodev"
               (e.g., devpts, proc and nfs). If /etc/filesystems
               ends in a line with a single * only, mount will
               read /proc/filesystems afterwards.
    Samuel Thibault
        Since linux 2.6.11, /proc/stat has an eighth value for cpu
        lines: stolen time, which is the time spent in other operating
        systems when running in a virtualized environment.

arp.7
        Updated BUGS text referring to jiffies; refer to time.7 instead.

credentials.7
    mtk
        Add words to note that file system ID is Linux specific.

hier.7
    Maxime Vaudequin
        This is some corrections for hier.7:
        - missing period for /media and /mnt
        - /mnt description is not totally correct, it is true for some
          distributions but in others /mnt is used as a temporary FS
          mount point, as it is specified by FHS:
          http://www.pathname.com/fhs/pub/fhs-2.3.html#MNTMOUNTPOINTFORATEMPORARILYMOUNT
        - s/X-Windows/X-Window/ (3 occurrences)
        - section "SEE ALSO": s/mount(1)/mount(8)/

man-pages.7
man.7
mdoc.7
mdoc.samples.7
    mtk / Nicolas François
        Nowadays tmac.XXX are called XXX.tmac.

pthreads.7
    mtk
        Update text about modern threading implementations
        (NPTL vs LinuxThreads).

socket.7
    mtk, after a note by Andi Kleen
        Clarify that SO_SNDTIMEO and SO_RCVTIMEO only have effect for
        socket I/O calls; not for multiplexing system calls like
        select() and poll().

time.7
    mtk
        Add SEE ALSO reference to new timeradd.3.

Global changes

*.1p
*.3p
    mtk, after a note by Andi Kleen and consultation with Andrew Josey.
        Add a PROLOG section:
            This manual page is part of the POSIX Programmer's Manual.
            The Linux implementation of this interface may differ
            (consult the corresponding Linux manual page for details
            of Linux behavior), or the interface may not be implemented
            on Linux.

*.0p
*.1p
*.3p
    mtk
        Some formatting fixes, mostly to get rid of unwanted
        spaces before "," in formatted output.

*
*/*
    mtk
        Change all occurrences of my email address in man-pages source
        to my new gmail address.

Many many pages
    Maxime Vaudequin
        I noticed useless use of macros with alternating formatting
        (".IR" instead ".I" which suffices, ".BR" instead ".B", etc.)
        because there is only one element.  For example in ldconfig.8:

            -.BR /sbin/ldconfig
            +.B /sbin/ldconfig

        This is not very important, it only makes the sources more tidy.
        To find these I used:

            egrep '^\.(B[RI]|R[IB]|I[RB]) ([^ ]+|\"[^\"]\+\")$'

        And if you want to make these changes, you can use:

            sed 's/^\(\.[BRI]\)[BRI]\( \([^ ]\+\|\"[^\"]\+\"\)\)$/\1\2/g'

        s/stdlib.h/fcntl.h/ in SYNOPSIS.

proc.5
    Fernando Luis Vázquez Cao
        Update /proc/[number]/cmdline description.
        It used to be true that the command line arguments were
        not accessible when the process had been swapped out.
        In ancient kernels (circa 2.0.*) the problem was that the
        kernel relied on get_phys_addr to access the user space buffer,
        which stopped working as soon as the process was swapped out.
        Recent kernels use get_user_pages for the same purpose and thus
        they should not have that limitation.

epoll.7
    Davide Libenzi / mtk
        Clarify the somewhat unintuitive behavior that occurs if a file
        descriptor in an epoll set is closed while other file descriptors
        referring to the same underlying open file description remain
        open.
        See also http://thread.gmane.org/gmane.linux.kernel/596462/.
    mtk
        Clarify error that occurs if we add an epoll fd to its own set.
    mtk
        A few minor rewordings.
    mtk, after a note by Chris Heath
        Rework Q1/A1, describing what happens when adding the same
        file descriptor twice to an epoll set, and when adding duplicate
        file descriptors to the same epoll set.
    Heikki Orsila / mtk / Davide Libenzi
        Clarify Q9/A9 to discuss packet/token-oriented files.
    mtk, after comments by Davide Libenzi and Chris Heath
        Added Q0/A0, making explicit that the key for items in an epoll
        set is [file descriptor, open file description].
    mtk, after a note by Ron Burk
        Change A3, to note that when events are available,
        the epoll file descriptor will indicate as being readable.
    mtk
        Add some further explanation to Q5/A5 about why an epoll file
        descriptor cannot be passed across a Unix domain socket.

posixoptions.7
    mtk
        Add SEE ALSO entry for standards(7).

regex.7
    mtk
        Add grep(1) to SEE ALSO.
        See http://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=348552.

standards.7
    mtk
        Add SEE ALSO entry for posixoptions(7).

time.7
    mtk
        Added SEE ALSO entry referring to timerfd_create.2.

fork.2
    mtk
        NOTES: since glibc 2.3.3, the glibc NPTL fork() wrapper
        bypasses the fork() system call to invoke clone() with
        flags providing equivalent functionality.

        more generic.
    mtk
        SEE ALSO: add chown(2) and chmod(2).

poll.2
    mtk

    mtk
        s/posix_madvise (2)/posix_madvise (3)/;
        (The referred-to page still doesn't exist yet, but hopefully
        will do sometime soon.)

ptrace.2

        always change *both* timestamps).
        CONFORMING TO: utimes() is in POSIX.1-2001.
    mtk
        Rename 'buf' argument of utime() to 'times' (like utimes()).
        Clarify explanation of EACCES and EPERM errors.

        information.
        Clarified discussion of capabilities, and noted that
        CAP_DAC_OVERRIDE also has a role.
        Other minor rewordings.

wait.2
    mtk, after a note by Justin Pryzby
        Add a sentence clarifying that even though the default disposition

        SIG_IGN results in different treatment of zombies.

aio_cancel.3
aio_error.3
aio_fsync.3

aio_return.3
aio_suspend.3
aio_write.3
    Kevin O'Gorman <kogorman@csc.calpoly.edu>

backtrace.3
    Nicolas François
        s/backtrace_symbols/backtrace_symbols_fd/ in one sentence.
    mtk
        Fix bogus reference to variable 'strings': should be:
        "the array of pointers".

ctime.3
    mtk
        Add warning under NOTES that asctime(), ctime(), gmtime(), and
        localtime() may each overwrite the static object returned by any
        of the other calls.
        Other minor edits.

dlopen.3
    mtk
        Add more detail to the description of the fields in the
        structure returned by dladdr().

fexecve.3
    mtk
        Clean up SYNOPSIS after work by cut-and-paste-Pete:
        the necessary header file is <unistd.h> not <sys/time.h>!

        Add documentation of lutimes(), which appeared in glibc 2.6.
    mtk
        Change description in NAME line ("or" is not correct: these calls

        CONFORMING TO: futimes() did not come from 4.2BSD.  (It came from
        FreeBSD; see the FreeBSD man page.)

getenv.3
    mtk
        Noted that caller must not modify returned value string.
        Noted that getenv() is not reentrant: the buffer may be statically

        setenv(), or unsetenv().
        Other minor rewrites.

getgrent.3
    Petter Reinholdtsen
        SEE ALSO: Add getgrouplist(3).
        as per http://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=479284.

malloc.3
    mtk
        RETURN VALUE: Note circumstances in which successful malloc() and
        calloc() can return NULL.

mq_open.3
    mtk, after a note by Marty Leisner
        Note that <fcntl.h> is needed for O_* constants and <sys/stat.h>
        is needed for 'mode' constants.

opendir.3
    mtk
        Describe treatment of close-on-exec flag by opendir() and
        fdopendir().

openpty.3
    mtk

raise.3
    mtk / Timothy Baldwin
        Clarify semantics of raise() when called from a multithreaded

        Remove outdated warning in NOTES; encourage the use of
        random(3) instead.
    Folkert van Heusden
        Clarify wording describing range of values returned by rand().

random.3
    aeb / mtk / Tolga Dalman
        Recommend use or random_r(3) for multithreaded applications
        that need independent, reproducible sequences of random numbers.

        Move references to "The Art of Computer Programming" and
        "Numerical Recipes", formerly in rand(3), to this page.

        Add drand48(93) to SEE ALSO list.

regex.3
    Heikki Orsila
        Clarify description of 'rm_eo' field.

sem_open.3
    mtk, after a note by Marty Leisner
        Note that <fcntl.h> is needed for O_* constants and <sys/stat.h> is
        needed for 'mode' constants.

sem_post.3
    mtk
        Added pointer to example in sem_wait(3).

sem_close.3
sem_destroy.3
sem_getvalue.3
sem_init.3

sem_wait.3
    mtk, after a note from Marty Leisner
        Add text to SYNOPSIS noting the need to link with "-lrt" or
        "-pthread".

setenv.3
    mtk
        setenv() copies 'name' and 'value' (contrast with putenv()).
        unsetenv() of a nonexistent variable does nothing and is
        considered successful.
        Noted that setenv() and unsetenv() need not be reentrant.

shm_open.3
    mtk, after a note by Marty Leisner
        Note that <fcntl.h> is needed for O_* constants and <sys/stat.h> is
        needed for 'mode' constants.

undocumented.3
    mtk
        initstate_r(3), setkey_r(3), setstate_r(3) are now documented.

utmp.5
    Nicolas François
        Small rewording.

resolv.conf.5
    Nicolas François
        gethostname() is in Section 2, not section 3.

ascii.7
    Stuart Brady
        Fix rendering of ' (backtick) and apostrophe (') in tables

charsets.7
    Nicolas François
        s/unicode.com/unicode.org/

credentials.7
    mtk
        NOTES: Pthreads requires that all threads share the same UIDs and
        GIDs.  But the Linux kernel maintains separate UIDs and GIDs for
        every thread.  NPTL does some work to ensure that credential
        changes by any thread are carried through to all POSIX threads in
        a process.
    mtk
        sysconf(_SC_NGROUPS_MAX) can be used to determine the number of
        supplementary groups that a process may belong to.
        Clarify that supplementary group IDs are specified in POSIX.1-2001.

epoll.7
    mtk, after a note from Sam Varshavchik
        For answer A2, change "not recommended" to "careful programming
        may be required".

inotify.7
    mtk
        Document SIGIO feature (new in 2.6.25) for inotify file descriptors.
    mtk
        Note that select()/poll()/epoll_wait() indicate a ready inotify
        file descriptor as readable.
    mtk
        Document IN_ATTRIB in a little more detail.

==================== Changes in man-pages-3.00 ====================

The following people contributed notes, ideas, or patches that have
been incorporated in changes in this release:

Andries Brouwer <Andries.Brouwer@cwi.nl>
Stuart Brady <sdbrady@ntlworld.com>

Apologies if I missed anyone!


Global changes
--------------

The POSIX.1 man pages (sections 0p, 1p, 3p) have been moved out
of this package into the separate man-pages-posix package.
This made sense because those pages are seldom changed (only formatting
fixes, etc.) so that it was unnecessary to redistribute them with each
man-pages release.


console_codes.4
random.4
dir_colors.5
proc.5
glob.7
    Stuart Brady
        s/`/\`/ for backquotes used in command substitution, for
        proper rendering in UTF-8.

Various pages
    mtk, after a note from Stuart Brady
        Using /'x'/ to denote a character (string) renders poorly in
        UTF-8, where the two ' characters render as closing single
        quotes.  On the other hand, using /`x'/ renders nicely on UTF-8,
        where proper opening and closing single quotes are produced by
        groff(1), but looks ugly when rendered in ASCII.  Using the
        sequence /\\aqx\\aq/ produces a reasonable rendering ('\\aq'
        is a vertical "apostrophe quote") in both UTF-8 and ASCII.
        So that change is made in a number of pages.
        See also http://www.cl.cal.ac.uk/~mgk25/ucs/quotes.html.

Various pages
    mtk
        Replace form /`string'/ by /"string"/, since the former renders
        poorly in ASCII.

termios.3
console_codes.4
tty_ioctl.4
termcap.5
charsets.7
    mtk
        Control character names (^X) are written boldface, without
        quotes.

printf.3
scanf.3
proc.5
glob.7
regex.7
    mtk
        Various edits to try and bring some consistency to the use of
        quotes.


Changes to individual pages
---------------------------

tty_ioctl.4
    mtk
        Small rewordings in description of packet mode.

locale.7
    mtk
        Minor formatting fixes.

Changes to individual pages
---------------------------

acct.2
    mtk
        Add a few more words to DESCRIPTION.
        NOTES: Add pointer to acct(5).

alarm.2
    Alain Portal
        s/process/calling process/ so as to say that the alarm signal is
        delivered to the calling process.

brk.2
    Yao Zhao / mtk
        Clarify discussion of return value of sbrk().
    mtk
        DESCRIPTION: Add some sentences giving an overview of these
        interfaces.
        Add note recommending use of malloc(3).
        Change name of brk() argument to the simpler 'addr'.
        Add "(void *)" cast to "-1" for error return of sbrk().
        Removed some incorrect text about "brk(0)".
        Note that SUSv2 specified the return value of sbrk().
        Added a detail on the glibc brk() wrapper.
        Remove discussions of old standards (C89 and POSIX.1-1990);
        CONFORMING TO already discusses the situation with respect
        to more recent standards.

chmod.2
    mtk
        Clarify description of chmod() and fchmod().
        Add further detail on S_ISUID, S_ISGID, and S_ISVTX permissions.
        Reformat list of permissions bits.

chown.2
    mtk
        Describe rules governing ownership of new files (bsdgroups
        versus sysvgroups, and the effect of the parent directory's
        set-group-ID permission bit).

chroot.2
    Alain Portal
        Clarify description a little.
        s/changes the root directory/
          changes the root directory of the calling process/

execve.2
    mtk
        Fix text that warns against use of NULL argv and envp.
        Using a NULL envp does in fact seem to be portable (works
        on Solaris and FreeBSD), but the Linux semantics for a NULL
        argv certainly aren't consistent with other implementations.
        See http://bugzilla.kernel.org/show_bug.cgi?id=8408.

getdents.2
    mtk, after a note from George Spelvin
        Document d_type field, present since kernel 2.6.4.
        Other minor edits.

getitimer.2
    mtk
        Noted that POSIX.1 leaves interactions with alarm(), sleep(),
        and usleep() unspecified.
        Linux 2.6.16 removed the MAX_SEC_IN_JIFFIES ceiling on timer
        values.
        Other minor changes.

io_cancel.2
io_destroy.2
io_getevents.2
io_setup.2
io_submit.2
    mtk, after a note by Masatake YAMOTO and input from Jeff Moyer
        Describe the unconventional error return provided by the
        wrapper function in libaio (and contrast with behavior if
        the system call is invoked via syscall(2)).
        See http://thread.gmane.org/gmane.linux.ltp/4445/
    Alain Portal / mtk
        Re-order ERRORS and SEE ALSO entries to be alphabetical.

io_getevents.2
    Alain Portal
        Small wording fix.

io_submit.2
    Jeff Moyer
        s/AIO request blocks/AIO control blocks/

mknod.2
    mtk
        Note that EEXIST applies, even if the pathname is a
        (possibly dangling) symbolic link.

nanosleep.2
    mtk, after a report from Stephane Chazelas
        Remove crufty discussion of HZ, and replace with a pointer
        to time(7).
        See http://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=485636
    mtk, after some discussions with Bart Van Assche and Roman Zippel
        NOTES: describe CLOCK_REALTIME versus CLOCK_NANOSLEEP
        See also http://thread.gmane.org/gmane.linux.kernel/696854/
        "nanosleep() uses CLOCK_MONOTONIC, should be CLOCK_REALTIME?"
    mtk
        Replace mentions of "process' by "thread".
        NOTES: describe case where clock_nanosleep() can be preferable.
        Some minor rewrites.

open.2
    mtk, after a note from Christoph Hellwig
        NOTES: Note that access mode flags are not single bits,
        and document the Linuxism "access mode 3".
        See also http://thread.gmane.org/gmane.linux.kernel/653123.

readdir.2
    mtk
        Minor wording fixes.

recv.2
    Alain Portal
        Add comment to 'ee_pad' field in structure definition.

sched_setscheduler.2
    mtk
        Add pointer to discussion of RLIMIT_RTTIME in getrlimit.2.
    mtk, after a note by Andrew Clayton
        Rewrote and restructured various parts of the page for greater
        clarity.
    mtk
        Add more detail to the rules that are applied when an
        unprivileged process with a non-zero RLIMIT_RTPRIO limit
        changes policy and priority.
        SEE ALSO: Add Documentation/scheduler/sched-rt-group.txt

sync_file_range.2
    Pavel Machek
        SYNC_FILE_RANGE_WRITE can block on writes greater than request
        queue size.  For some background, see
        http://thread.gmane.org/gmane.linux.kernel/687713/focus=688340

syscalls.2
    mtk
        Added system call history back to version 1.2.
        Fix typo on kernel version for pivot_root().

syslog.2
    WANG Cong
        Document ENOSYS error, which can occur if kernel was built without
        CONFIG_PRINTK.

utime.2
    Nicolas François
        Clarify description of 'times' array for utimes().

adjtime.3
    mtk
        The longstanding bug that if delta was NULL, olddelta
        didn't return the outstanding clock adjustment, is now fixed
        (since glibc 2.8 + kernel 2.6.26).
        http://sourceware.org/bugzilla/show_bug?id=2449
        http://bugzilla.kernel.org/show_bug.cgi?id=6761

dprintf.3
    mtk
        Note that these functions are included in the next POSIX revision.
        Remove editorial discussion about what the functions should have
        been named.

ftime.3

    mtk
        Improve description or 'hints' and 'res' arguments.
        Add details on numeric strings that can be specified for 'node'.
        Other fairly major restructurings and rewrites to improve
        logical structure and clarity of the page.
        SEE ALSO: Add hostname(7).

gethostbyname.3
    mtk
        DESCRIPTION: Add reference to inet_addr(3) for dotted notation.
        SEE ALSO: add inet(3).
    mtk
        Added BUGS section noting that gethostbyname() does not
        recognize hexadecimal components in dotted address strings;
        See http://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=482973

getmntent.3
    mtk, after Stuart Cunningham pointed out the typo
        Remove statement that LSB deprecates the functions
        "endmntent(), setmntent() [sic] and setmntent()".
        This doesn't seem to be true (I can't find mention of it
        being deprecated in any of the LSB specs).  Rather, LSB simply
        doesn't specify these functions.  (LSB 1.3 had a spec of
        setmntent(), but not getmntent() or endmntent(), and noted
        that having a spec of setmntent() was of little use without
        also having a spec of getmntent().)
        See also https://lists.linux-foundation.org/pipermail/lsb-discuss/2006-October/003078.html

getnameinfo.3
    Tolga Dalman
        Remove mention of sa_len field from example code.
        That field is a BSDism not present on Linux.
    mtk
        Various minor changes.

inet.3
    mtk / Stephane Chazelas
        inet_aton() is *not* in POSIX.1.
        Rewrote discussion of why inet_addr() is disfavored.
        SEE ALSO: Add getaddrinfo(3).
        as per http://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=482979.
    mtk, after a note by Stephane Chazelas
        Describe the various address forms supported by inet_aton().
    mtk
        Rewrite description of inet_network().
        Clarify discussion of inet_lnaof(), inet_netof(), and inet_makeaddr().
        Add discussion of Classful Addressing, noting that it is obsolete.
        Added an EXAMPLE program.
    mtk
        Relocate discussion of i386 byte order to NOTES.
        Note that inet_aton() returns an address in network byte order.
        SEE ALSO: Add byteorder(3) and getnameinfo(3).

inet_ntop.3
    mtk
        Remove unneeded header files from SYNOPSIS.
        SEE ALSO: Add inet(3) and getnameinfo(3).
        Make NAME line more precise.
        Move errors to an ERRORS section.
        Add EXAMPLE section pointing to inet_pton(3).

inet_pton.3
    mtk / Stephane Chazelas
        Remove statement that inet_pton() extends inet_ntoa();
        that's not really true, since inet_pton() doesn't support
        all of the string forms that are supported by inet_ntoa().
        SEE ALSO: Add getaddrinfo(3).
        as per http://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=482987.
    mtk
        Describe IPv6 address formats.
        Describe dotted decimal format in more detail.
        Add an example program.
    mtk
        Remove unneeded header files from SYNOPSIS.
        Make NAME line more precise.
        Make description of return value more precise.
        SEE ALSO: Add inet(3).

mkfifo.3
    mtk
        Note that EEXIST applies, even if the pathname is a
        (possibly dangling) symbolic link.

mkstemp.3
    mtk
        Fix discussion of O_EXCL flag.
        These functions may also fail for any of the errors described
        in open(2).

        Recommend against drem(), in favor of remainder().

scanf.3
    mtk, after a note from Stephane Chazelas
        Add an ERRORS section documenting at least some of the errors
        that may occur for scanf().
        See also http://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=487254.
    mtk, after a note from Stephane Chazelas; review by Stephane Chazelas
        Document the GNU 'a' modifier for dynamically allocating strings.
        See also http://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=487254.
        Document the GNU 'm' modifier for dynamically allocating strings.

strcat.3

strerror.3
    mtk, after a note from Daniele Giacomini
        Modify SYNOPSIS to show prototypes of both versions of strerror_r(),
        and make other small clarifications of the description regarding
        the two versions.

random.4
    George Spelvin (taking time out from his busy Broadway schedule),
    with some tweaks by Matt Mackall and mtk
        Add a Usage subsection that recommends most users to use
        /dev/urandom, and emphasizes parsimonious usage of
        /dev/random.

Changes to individual pages (math functions)
--------------------------------------------

Almost all of the changes in this release relate to math man pages.
Very many changes were made to the math pages, including:

* Fixed feature test macros (FTMs).  Often, the FTM requirements
  for the "float" and "long double" versions of a math function are
  different from the requirements for the "double" version.  Each math
  page now shows the correct FTM requirements for all three versions
  of the function(s) it describes.  This may have required either
  a change to the existing FTM text (if the requirements for the
  "double" function were already described), or the addition of an FTM
  description to a SYNOPSIS where one was not previously present
  (typically because the "double" version of the function does not
  require any FTMs to be defined).
* CONFORMING TO: in many cases, POSIX.1-2001 was not mentioned.
  Where a function is specified in POSIX.1-2001, this is now noted.
  Also, statements about what other standards a function conforms to
  were generally clarified.  (The wording about which functions conformed
  to C99 was previously often done as an add on sentence; now it is made
  part of the first sentence of the CONFORMING TO section, along with
  POSIX.1-2001.)
* RETURN VALUE: in many cases, pages lacked descriptions of the return
  value when the function arguments are special values such as +0, -0,
  NaN (not-a-number), +infinity, -infinity, etc.  This has been fixed.
  I carried out tests on glibc 2.8 to ensure that all of these
  functions match the RETURN VALUE descriptions (and the POSIX.1-2001
  requirements).
* ERRORS: many pages lacked a clear (or indeed any) description of
  how errno is set on error and what exception is raised for each error.
  This has been fixed.  The ERRORS sections are now generally headed up
  as per the POSIX.1 way of doing things, describing Pole / Range /
  Domain errors, as applicable.
  I carried out tests on glibc 2.8 to ensure that all of these
  functions match the ERRORS descriptions.  Deviations from POSIX.1-2001
  requirements have been filed as glibc bug reports, and noted in the
  man pages.  (The pages now describe the situation for ERRORS as at glibc
  2.8; I may eventually try and extend the text with descriptions of
  changes in older versions of glibc.)
  NOTE: one point that has not been covered in any page is the
  circumstances that generate inexact (FE_INEXACT) exceptions.
  (The details for these exceptions are not specified in POSIX.1-2001,
  and I haven't gone looking for the standards that describe the details.)

scalb.3
    mtk

New and rewritten pages
-----------------------

move_pages.2
    Christoph Lameter, various edits and improvements by mtk
        Documentation of the move_pages() system call.
        This page was formerly part of the numactl package, but really
        belongs in man-pages (since it describes a kernel interface).

clock_getcpuclockid.3
    mtk
        New page documenting the clock_getcpuclockid() library function,
        available since glibc 2.2.

udplite.7
    Gerrit Renker
        Document the Linux implementation of the UDP-Lite protocol,
        new in Linux 2.6.20.


Newly documented interfaces in existing pages
---------------------------------------------

proc.5
    Christoph Lameter, minor edits and improvements by mtk
        Documentation of the /proc/PID/numa_maps file.
        This material was formerly the numa_maps.5 page in the numactl
        package, but really belongs in man-pages (since it describes
        a kernel interface).


Global changes
--------------

nanosleep.2
inet_ntop.3
inet_pton.3
scanf.3
initrd.4
    mtk
        Fix mis-ordered (.SH) sections.

connect.2
socket.2
rtnetlink.3
arp.7
ddp.7
ip.7
ipv6.7
netlink.7
packet.7
raw.7
rtnetlink.7
socket.7
tcp.7
udp.7
unix.7
x25.7
    mtk
        s/PF_/AF_/ for socket family constants.  Reasons: the AF_ and
        PF_ constants have always had the same values; there never has
        been a protocol family that had more than one address family,
        and POSIX.1-2001 only specifies the AF_* constants.

Typographical or grammatical errors have been corrected in several
other places.


Changes to individual pages
---------------------------

execve.2
    mtk
        The floating-point environment is reset to the default
        during an execve().

get_mempolicy.2
    Lee Schermerhorn
        Misc cleanup of get_mempolicy(2):
        + mention that any mode flags will be saved with mode.
          I don't bother to document mode flags here because we
          already have a pointer to set_mempolicy(2) for more info
          on memory policy.  mode flags are discussed there.
        + remove some old, obsolete [IMO] NOTES and 'roff comments.
    Lee Schermerhorn
        Update the get_mempolicy(2) man page to add in the description of
        the MPOL_F_MEMS_ALLOWED flag, added in 2.6.23.
    mtk
        Document additional EINVAL error that occurs is MPOL_F_MEMS_ALLOWED
        is specified with either MPOL_F_ADDR or MPOL_F_NODE.

getitimer.2
    mtk
        CONFORMING TO: POSIX.1-2008 marks getitimer() and setitimer()
        obsolete.

mbind.2
    Lee Schermerhorn
        Fix error conditions, now that the kernel silently ignores
        nodes outside the task's cpuset, as long as one valid node
        remains.

        Now that cpuset man page exists, we can refer to it.  Remove
        stale comment regarding lack thereof.
    Lee Schermerhorn
        Add brief discussion of mode flags.
    Lee Schermerhorn
        Attempt to clarify discussion of MPOL_DEFAULT.
    mtk
        Fix URI reference for libnuma.

mprotect.2
    mtk / Maxin John
        Remove EFAULT from errors.  Under ENOMEM error, note that
        EFAULT was the error produced in some cases for kernels before
        2.4.19.

msgctl.2
    mtk, after a note from Filippo Santovito
        In the ipc_perm structure definition, some fields were
        incorrectly named: s/key/__key/ and s/seq/__seq/.

set_mempolicy.2
    Lee Schermerhorn
        Fix up the error return for nodemask containing nodes disallowed by
        the process' current cpuset.  Disallowed nodes are now silently ignored,
        as long as the nodemask contains at least one node that is on-line,
        allowed by the process' cpuset and has memory.

        Now that we have a cpuset man page, we can refer to cpusets directly
        in the man page text.

    Lee Schermerhorn
        Another attempt to rationalize description of MPOL_DEFAULT.

        Since ~2.6.25, the system default memory policy is "local allocation".
        MPOL_DEFAULT itself is a request to remove any non-default policy and
        "fall back" to the surrounding context.  Try to say that without delving
        into implementation details.

    Lee Schermerhorn
        Add discussion of mempolicy mode flags to set_mempolicy(2).
        This adds another reason for EINVAL.

setpgid.2
    mtk
        CONFORMING TO: POSIX.1-2008 marks setpgrp() obsolete.

semctl.2
    mtk, after a note from Filippo Santovito
        In the ipc_perm structure definition, some fields were
        incorrectly named: s/key/__key/ and s/seq/__seq/.

shmctl.2
    Filippo Santovito / mtk
        In the ipc_perm structure definition, some fields were
        incorrectly named: s/key/__key/ and s/seq/__seq/.

utime.2
    mtk
        CONFORMING TO: POSIX.1-2008 marks utime() obsolete.
        CONFORMING TO: POSIX.1-2008 removes the POSIX.1-2001 LEGACY
        marking of utimes(), so mention of this point has been
        removed from the page.

vfork.2
    mtk
        CONFORMING TO: POSIX.1-2008 removes the specification of vfork().

        CONFORMING TO: According to POSIX.1, the behavior of getcwd()
        is unspecified for the buf==NULL case.
    mtk
        Add an introductory paragraph giving an overview of what these
        functions do.
        Fix error in description of getwd(): it does not truncate the
        pathname; rather, it gives an error if the pathname exceeds
        PATH_MAX bytes.
        Rewrote RETURN VALUE section.
        Add EINVAL ENAMETOOLONG errors for getwd().
        Various other clarifications and wording fixes.
        CONFORMING TO: POSIX.1-2001 does not define any errors for
        getwd().
        CONFORMING TO: POSIX.1-2008 removes the specification of getwd().

gethostbyname.3

        ensures that "man 5 numa_maps" still works.
        (Eventually, we may want to remove this link.)

Changes to individual pages
---------------------------

eventfd.2
    Vijay Kumar
        When an eventfd overflows, select() indicates the file as both
        readable and writable (not as having an exceptional condition).

fcntl.2
    mtk
        F_DUPFD_CLOEXEC is specified in POSIX.1-2008.

getrlimit.2
    mtk
        NOTES: Add text mentioning the shell 'ulimit' (or 'limit')
        built-in command for setting resource limits.

gettimeofday.2
    mtk
        CONFORMING TO: POSIX.1-2008 marks gettimeofday() as obsolete.

link.2
    mtk
        Note kernel version where Linux stopped following symbolic
        links in 'oldpath'; see also http://lwn.net/Articles/294667.
        POSIX.1-2008 makes it implementation-dependent whether or not
        'oldpath' is dereferenced if it is a symbolic link.
        Add a reference to linkat(2) for an interface that allows
        precise control of the treatment of symbolic links.

mbind.2
    mtk
        Remove material on library support and numactl; that material
        is now in numactl.7.

mmap.2
    mtk
        Add kernel version numbers for MAP_32BIT.
        Add some details on MAP_32BIT (see http://lwn.net/Articles/294642).

open.2
    mtk
        O_CLOEXEC is specified in POSIX.1-2008.

socket.2
    mtk
        s/d/domain/ for name of argument.
        Add reference to socket(2) for further information on
        domain, type, and protocol arguments.

utimensat.2
    mtk
        CONFORMING TO: POSIX.1-2008 specifies utimensat() and futimens().

dirfd.3
    mtk
        CONFORMING TO: Add POSIX.1-2008; other minor changes.

exec.3
    mtk
        Small rewording: "s/returned/failed with/ [an error]".

fmemopen.3
    mtk
        Since glibc 2.7, it is possible to seek past the end of
        a stream created by open_memstream().  Add a BUGS section
        describing the bug in earlier glibc versions.

gethostbyname.3
    mtk
        Clarify exactly which functions are obsoleted by getnameinfo()
        and getaddrinfo().

getnetent.3
    mtk
        Rephrase description in terms of a database, rather than a file.
        Note that each of the get*() functions opens a connection to
        the database if necessary.
        The database connection is held open between get*() calls if
        'stayopen' is non-zero (not necessarily 1).
        s/zero terminated list/NULL-terminated list/
    mtk
        In glibc 2.2, the type of the 'net' argument for getnetbyaddr()
        changed from 'long' to 'uint32_t'.
    mtk
        Note that the gethostbyaddr() 'net' argument is in host byte order.
    mtk
        RETURN VALUE: emphasize that returned pointer points to a
        statically allocated structure.
        SEE ALSO: add getnetent_r.3.

getprotoent.3
    mtk
        Rephrase description in terms of a database, rather than a file.
        Note that each of the get*() functions opens a connection to
        the database if necessary.
        The database connection is held open between get*() calls if
        'stayopen' is non-zero (not necessarily 1).
        s/zero terminated list/NULL-terminated list/
    mtk
        RETURN VALUE: emphasize that returned pointer points to a
        statically allocated structure.
        SEE ALSO: add getprotoent_r.3.

getrpcent.3
    mtk
        s/rpc/RPC/.
        Rephrase description in terms of a database, rather than a file.
        Note that each of the get*() functions opens a connection to
        the database if necessary.
        s/zero terminated list/NULL-terminated list/
    mtk
        RETURN VALUE: emphasize that returned pointer points to a
        statically allocated structure.
        SEE ALSO: add getrpcent_r.3.

getservent.3
    mtk
        Rephrase description in terms of a database, rather than a file.
        Note that each of the get*() functions opens a connection to
        the database if necessary.
        The database connection is held open between get*() calls if
        'stayopen' is non-zero (not necessarily 1).
        s/zero terminated list/NULL-terminated list/
    mtk
        RETURN VALUE: emphasize that returned pointer points to a
        statically allocated structure.
        SEE ALSO: add getservent_r.3.

mkdtemp.3
    mtk
        CONFORMING TO: this function is specified in POSIX.1-2008.

mq_notify.3
    Venkatesh Srinivas
        s/sigev_notify_function/sigev_thread_function/
        as per http://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=494956.

realpath.3
    mtk
        Relocate text for resolved_path==NULL case to DESCRIPTION.
        POSIX.1-2001 leaves the resolved_path==NULL case as
        implementation-defined; POSIX.1-2008 specifies the behavior
        described in this man page.

sem_init.3
    mtk
        POSIX.1-2008 rectifies the POSIX.1-2001 omission, specifying
        that zero is returned by a successful sem_init() call.

core.5
    Mike Bianchi / mtk
        Make the page more helpful to non-programmers by referencing
        the documentation of the shell's 'ulimit' command in the
        discussion of RLIMIT_CORE and RLIMIT_FSIZE.
        SEE ALSO: Add bash(1).
    mtk
        Note that a core dump file can be used in a debugger.

proc.5
    mtk
        Remove /proc/PID/numa_maps material (it is now in numa(7)).

cpuset.7
    mtk
        SEE ALSO: Add numa(7).

inotify.7
    mtk / Li Zefan
         Explain bug that occurred in coalescing identical events in
         kernels before 2.6.25.
         (See commit 1c17d18e3775485bf1e0ce79575eb637a94494a2
         "A potential bug in inotify_user.c" in the 2.6.25 Changelog.)

pthreads.7
    mtk
        Update thread-safe functions list with changes in POSIX.1-2008.
        SEE ALSO: add proc(5).

signal.7
    mtk
        Update list of async-signal-safe functions for POSIX.1-2008.

---------------------------

fcntl.2
    mtk, after a note by Mike Bianchi
        More clearly and consistently describe whether
        or not the third argument to fcntl() is required,
        and what its type should be.
    mtk
        Move description of negative l_len  from NOTES, integrating
        it into the discussion of file locking.
        Minor rewrites of the text on file locking.

getrusage.2
    Bernd Eckenfels
        SEE ALSO: Add clock(3), clock_gettime(3).
        See http://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=353475

ioctl_list.2
    mtk
        Remove old sentence about where to send updates for this page.
        Add more detail on mount options that prevent updates to atime.

sched_setscheduler.2
    Carsten Emde
        Update kernel version numbers relating to real-time support.

stat.2
    H. Peter Anvin
        Note that lstat() will generally not trigger automounter
        action, whereas stat() will.

clock.3
    Bernd Eckenfels
        SEE ALSO: Add clock_gettime(3).
        See http://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=353475

clock_getres.3
    Tolga Dalman / mtk
        Add "Link with -lrt" to SYNOPSIS; remove now redundant
        sentence mentioning librt from NOTES.

getdate.3
    mtk
        Rewrite description of getdate_r() and integrate into main text
        (rather than describing in NOTES).
        Other parts rewritten for greater clarity.
        Make it clearer in the main text that glibc does not implement %Z;
        remove discussion of that point from NOTES.
        Added an example program.

hsearch.3
    mtk
        Noted that table size as specified by 'nel' is immutable.
        Described differences between hsearch() and hsearch_r().
        Added missing pieces to RETURN VALUE.
        Added a number of new entries under ERRORS.
        NOTES: added some basic advice on sizing the hash table;
        noted that when a table is destroyed, the caller is responsible
        for freeing the buffers pointed to by 'key' and 'data' fields.
        One of the BUGS was fixed in glibc 2.3.
        Rewrote and clarified various other pieces.
        Rename arguments for reentrant functions, using same name as
        glibc headers: s/ret/retval/; s/tab/htab/.
    mtk, after a suggestion by Timothy S. Nelson
        Integrate discussion of reentrant functions into main discussion
        (rather than as a short paragraph at the end).

iconv.3
    Bruno Haible
        Describe "shift sequence" input.

ptsname.3
    sukadev
        Fix return type of ptsname_r() in SYNOPSIS.

readdir.3
    H. Peter Anvin
        s/stat(2)/lstat(2)/ when discussing d_type (since we
        are talking about a case where we might be interested to
        whether the file itself is a symbolic link).

sigsetops.3
    Chris Head, signed-off-by: Mike Frysinger
        Fix typo: s/sigdelset/sigorset/

proc.5
    Mats Wichmann / mtk
        s/\[number]/[pid]/ in file names for /proc/PID files.
        And similar changes for task/[tid] sub-directories.
    mtk / Mats Wichmann
        In the description if /proc/[pid]/environ, remove reference to
        lilo(8)/grub(8) since there seems to be nothing in those pages
        that related to this /proc file.
    Michael Schurter / mtk
        Remove sentence wrongly saying that /proc/meminfo reports
        info in bytes;
        see http://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=462969
    mtk
        Note that /proc/meminfo reports system-wide memory usage
        statistics.
    Joe Korty
        Document new fields in /proc/interrupts that were added in
        Linux 2.6.24.

unix.7
    Marko Kreen
        Since glibc 2.8, _GNU_SOURCE must be defined in order to get
        the definition of the ucred structure from <sys/socket.h>.

--------------

closedir.3
dirfd.3
readdir.3
rewinddir.3
scandir.3
seekdir.3
telldir.3
    mtk
        Fix 'dir' argument name: should be 'dirp'.
        POSIX.1-2008 and glibc call this argument 'dirp' (consistent
        with the fact that it is a *pointer* to a DIR structure).

New and rewritten pages
-----------------------

umount.2
    Michael Kerrisk
        Create a new page for umount() and umount2() by extracting
        existing material from mount.2 page.


New and changed links
---------------------

umount2.2
    Michael Kerrisk
        Change link to point to new umount.2
            The umount2() material migrated from mount.2 to umount.2


Changes to individual pages
---------------------------

execve.2
    Michael Kerrisk
        _SC_ARG_MAX is no longer necessarily constant
            POSIX.1-2001 says that the values returned by sysconf()
            are constant for the life of the process.
            But the fact that, since Linux 2.6.23, ARG_MAX is settable
            via RLIMIT_STACK means _SC_ARG_MAX is no longer constant,
            since it can change at each execve().
    Michael Kerrisk
        Linux now imposes a floor on the ARG_MAX limit
            Starting with Linux 2.6.23, the ARG_MAX limit became
	    settable via (1/4 of) RLIMIT_STACK.  This broke ABI
	    compatibility if RLIMIT_STACK was set such that ARG_MAX
	    was < 32 pages.  Document the fact that since 2.6.25
	    Linux imposes a floor on ARG_MAX, so that the old limit
	    of 32 pages is guaranteed.

            For some background on the changes to ARG_MAX in
	    kernels 2.6.23 and 2.6.25, see:
                http://sourceware.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=5786
                http://bugzilla.kernel.org/show_bug.cgi?id=10095
                http://thread.gmane.org/gmane.linux.kernel/646709/focus=648101,
                checked into 2.6.25 as
	        commit a64e715fc74b1a7dcc5944f848acc38b2c4d4ee2.

            Also some reordering/rewording of the discussion of ARG_MAX.

fallocate.2
    Michael Kerrisk
        Note lack of glibc wrapper; caller must use syscall(2)
            Glibc doesn't (and quite probably won't) include a
	    wrapper for this system call.  Therefore, point out that
	    potential callers will need to use syscall(2), and rewrite
	    the RETURN VALUE text to show things as they would be if
	    syscall() is used.

    Michael Kerrisk
        Refer reader to posix_fallocate(3) for portable interface
            Add a para to start of page that points out that this is the
            low-level, Linux-specific API, and point the reader to
	    posix_fallocate(3) for the portable API.

getdents.2
readdir.3
    Michael Kerrisk
        d_type is currently only supported on ext[234]
            As at kernel 2.6.27, only ext[234] support d_type.
            On other file systems, d_type is always set to DT_UNKNOWN (0).

getdents.2
    Michael Kerrisk
        Add an example program
    Michael Kerrisk
        comment out linux_dirent fields with varying location
            The location of the fields after d_name varies according to
            the size of d_name.  We can't properly declare them in C;
            therefore, put those fields inside a comment.
    Michael Kerrisk
        The DT_* constants are defined in <dirent.h>
    Michael Kerrisk
        Remove header files from SYNOPSIS
            None of the header files provides what is needed.
            Calls are made via syscall(2).
    Michael Kerrisk
        The programmer must define the linux_dirent structure
            Point out that this structure is not defined in glibc headers.
    Michael Kerrisk
        s/dirent/linux_dirent/
            The structure isn't currently defined in glibc headers,
	    and the kernel name of the structure is 'linux_dirent' (as
            was already used in some, but not all, places in this page).

getrlimit.2
    Michael Kerrisk
        Reword/relocate discussion of BSD's historical RLIMIT_OFILE
            The old sentence sat on its own in an odd place, and anyway the
            modern BSDs use the name RLIMIT_NOFILE.
    Michael Kerrisk
        Refer to execve(2) for RLIMIT_STACK's effect on ARG_MAX
            Refer the reader to new text in execve(2) that describes how
            (since Linux 2.6.23) RLIMIT_STACK determines the value of ARG_MAX.

getrusage.2
    Michael Kerrisk
        Rusage measures are preserved across execve(2)

mlock.2
    Maxin John
        Add EAGAIN error.

move_pages.2
    Nicolas François
        Make a detail of EPERM error more precise

mount.2
    Michael Kerrisk
        Add description of per-process namespaces
            Describe per-process namespaces, including discussion
            of clone() and unshare CLONE_NEWNS, and /proc/PID/mounts.
    Michael Kerrisk
        List a few other file systems that we may see in /proc/filesystems
            Add some modern file systems to that list (xfs, jfs, ext3,
            reiserfs).
    Michael Kerrisk
        Document MS_SILENT (and MS_VERBOSE)

mount.2
umount.2
    Michael Kerrisk
        Split umount*() out into a separate page
            The length of this page means that it's becoming difficult
	    to parse which info is specific to mount() versus
	    umount()/umount2(), so split the umount material out into
	    its own page.

pause.2
    Michael Kerrisk
        Remove mention of words "library function"
            This really is a system call.

readdir.2
    Michael Kerrisk
        The programmer must declare the old_linux_dirent structure
            Glibc does not provide a definition of this structure.
    Michael Kerrisk
        s/dirent/old_linux_dirent/
            Nowadays, this is the name of the structure in the
	    kernel sources.
    Michael Kerrisk
        Remove words "which may change"
            These words are slightly bogus: although the interface
	    is obsolete, for ABI-compatibility reasons, the kernel folk
	    should never be changing this interface.
    Michael Kerrisk
        Remove header files from SYNOPSIS
            glibc doesn't provide any support for readdir(2),
            so remove these header files (which otherwise suggest
            that glibc does provide the required pieces).

recv.2
    Nicolas François
        Move kernel version number to first mention to MSG_ERRQUEUE.

semop.2
    Kirill A. Shutemov
        Fix typo in example
            (The '&' before sop in the semop() call is unneeded.)

send.2
    Michael Kerrisk
        Make kernel version for MSG_CONFIRM more precise
            s/2.3+ only/Since Linux 2.3.15/

sigaction.2
    Michael Kerrisk
        Refer reader to signal(7) for an overview of signals
        Explain semantics of signal disposition during fork() and execve()
        Refer to signal(7) for more details on signal mask.

sigaltstack.2
    Michael Kerrisk
        Explain inheritance of alternate signal stack across fork(2)

sigwaitinfo.2
    Michael Kerrisk
        Distinguish per-thread and process-wide signals
            A sentence clarifying that pending signal set is union of
            per-thread and process-wide pending signal sets.

    Michael Kerrisk
        These interfaces have per-thread semantics
            The page was previously fuzzy about whether the these interfaces
            have process-wide or per-thread semantics.  (E.g., now the
            page states that the calling *thread* (not process) is suspended
            until the signal is delivered.)

sigpending.2
    Michael Kerrisk
        Explain effect of fork() and execve() for pending signal set
    Michael Kerrisk
        Explain how thread's pending signal set is defined
            The pending set is the union of per-thread pending signals
	    and process-wide pending signals.

sigprocmask.2
    Michael Kerrisk
        Explain effects of fork() and execve() for signal mask

splice.2
    Michael Kerrisk
        Note that SPLICE_F_MOVE is a no-op since kernel 2.6.21

syscall.2
    Michael Kerrisk
        Add more detail about wrapper functions
            Add a few more details about work generally done by wrapper
            functions.  Note that syscall(2) performs the same steps.

tkill.2
    Michael Kerrisk
        EINVAL error can also occur for invalid TGID
            The EINVAL error on an invalid TGID for tgkill() was
            not documented; this change documents it.

utimensat.2
    Michael Kerrisk
        POSIX.1-2008 revision will likely affect FTMs for futimens()
            Make it clear that the POSIX.1 revision that is likely
            to affect the feature test macro requirements for futimens()
            is POSIX.1-2008.
    Nicolas François
        Make various wordings a little more precise.
            The times argument point to *an array of* structures, and the
            man-page should say that consistently.

wait4.2
    Michael Kerrisk
        wait3() is a library function layered on wait4().
            On Linux wait3() is a library function implemented on top
            of wait4().  (Knowing this is useful when using strace(2),
            for example.)

atan2.3
    Nicolas François
        Fix error in description of range or return value
            In recent changes to the man page, mtk accidentally changed
            the description of the return value range to -pi/2..pi/2;
            the correct range is -pi..pi.

cmsg.3
    Nicolas François
        Add parentheses after macro names.

ctime.3
    Michael Kerrisk
        Clarify mktime()'s use of tm_isdst
            Describe use of tm_isdst for input to mktime();
            explain how mktime() modifies this field.
            (This field is left unchanged in case of error.)

            http://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=500178
    Michael Kerrisk
        Clarify wording for ctime_r() and asctime_r() to indicate that
        the buffer must be at least 26 *bytes*.
    Michael Kerrisk
        Minor rewording of mktime() description.

floor.3
    Nicolas François
        floor.3: Fix error in description: s/smallest/largest/

hsearch.3
    André Goddard Rosa
        Call hdestroy() after using hash table created by hcreate(),
	for the sake of completeness

mq_getattr.3
    Michael Kerrisk
        mq_getattr() and mq_setattr() are layered on mq_getsetattr(2)
            mq_getattr() and mq_setattr() are library functions layered on
            top of the mq_getsetattr(2) system call.
            (This is useful info for users of strace(1).)

mq_receive.3
    Michael Kerrisk
        mq_send() is a library function layered on mq_timedreceive() syscall
             This info is useful for users of strace(1).

mq_send.3
    Michael Kerrisk
        mq_send() is a library function layered on mq_timedsend() syscall
             This info is useful for users of strace(1).

nextafter.3
    Nicolas François
        Make description more precise: s/next/largest/

readdir.3
    Michael Kerrisk
        SEE ALSO: add getdents(2)
             Because readdir() is implemented on top of getdents(2).

realpath.3
    Michael Kerrisk
        Clarify that returned pathname is NULL terminated
            Also clarify that null-byte is included in PATH_MAX limit.

proc.5
    Michael Kerrisk
        Rewrite and simplify description of /proc/mounts
            Most of the relevant discussion is now under /proc/PID/mounts;
            all that needs to be here is a mention of the pre-2.4.19
            system-wide namespace situation, and a reference to the
            discussion under /proc/PID/mounts.
    Michael Kerrisk
        Add description of /proc/PID/mounts
            Largely cribbed from existing /proc/mounts discussion, which is
            about to be rewritten.

mq_overview.7
    Michael Kerrisk
        Add mq_notify() to list of lib. functions and syscalls in MQ API

signal.7
    Michael Kerrisk
        Improve description in NAME section
        Add mention of sigaltstack(2).
        Describe syscalls that synchronously wait for a signal,
        Give overview of syscalls that block until a signal is caught
        Add overview of interfaces for sending signals.

    Michael Kerrisk
        Describe semantics w.r.t. fork() and execve()
            Include text describing semantics of fork() and execve() for
            signal dispositions, signal mask, and pending signal set.

            Move the shell session text that demonstrates the use of
            the example program so that it precedes the actual
            example program.  This makes the page consistent with the
            majority of other pages.


Changes to individual pages
---------------------------

epoll_create.2
    Michael Kerrisk
        Say more about unused epoll_create() 'size' arg
            Supply a little more explanation about why the 'size' argument
            of epoll_create() is nowadays ignored.

eventfd.2
    Michael Kerrisk
        Remove crufty text relating to flags argument
            Remove sentence saying that glibc adds a flags argument
            to the syscall; that was only relevant for the older
            eventfd() system call.
getdents.2
    Christoph Hellwig
        Fix text relating to DT_UNKNOWN and 'd_type' support
            Some file systems provide partial support for 'dt_type',
            returning DT_UNKNOWN for cases they don't support.
            Update the discussion of 'd_type' and DT_UNKNOWN to
            support this.

getpeername.2, getsockname.2
    Michael Kerrisk
        SEE ALSO: add ip(7) and unix(7)

getsockopt.2
    Michael Kerrisk
        EINVAL can also occur if 'optval' is invalid
            In some cases, EINVAL can occur if 'optval' is invalid.
            Note this, and point reader to an example in ip(7).
            In response to:
            http://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=216092

inotify_init.2
pipe.2
timerfd_create.2
    Michael Kerrisk
        Clarify *_NONBLOCK description
            Make it clear that the NONBLOCK flag sets an attribute in the new
            open file description.

sched_yield.2
    Michael Kerrisk
        Rewrite description in terms of threads
            The text formerly described the operation of sched_yield() in
            terms of processes.  It should be in terms of threads.
    Michael Kerrisk
        Add NOTES text on appropriate use of sched_yield()
            Strategic calls to sched_yield() can be used to improve
            performance, but unnecessary use should be avoided.

sigaction.2
    Michael Kerrisk
        Clarify that sa_mask affects the *per-thread* signal mask
            The page didn't previously clearly explain the scope of the
            signal mask that is affected by sa_mask.

signalfd.2
    Michael Kerrisk
        Remove crufty text relating to flags argument
            Remove sentence saying that glibc adds a flags argument
            to the syscall; that was only relevant for the older
            signalfd() system call.

sigprocmask.2
    Michael Kerrisk
        Clarify that sigprocmask() operates on a per-thread mask
            The first sentence of the page was vague on the scope of the
            attribute changed by sigprocmask().  Reword to make this
            clearer and add a sentence in NOTES to explicitly state that
            the signal mask is a per-thread attribute.

socket.2
    Michael Kerrisk
        Document SOCK_NONBLOCK and SOCK_CLOEXEC flags
            These flags, specified in the 'type' argument, are supported
            since Linux 2.6.27.

socketpair.2
    Michael Kerrisk
        Refer to socket(2) for SOCK_CLOEXEC and SOCK_NONBLOCK
            Refer the reader to socket(2) for a description of the SOCK_CLOEXEC
            and SOCK_NONBLOCK flags, which are supported by socketpair() since
            Linux 2.6.27.

syscalls.2
    Michael Kerrisk
        Add new 2.6.27 system calls
            Add pipe2(), dup3(), epoll_create1(), inotify_init1(),
            eventfd2(), signalfd4().

timerfd_create.2
    Michael Kerrisk
        Document timerfd_create() TFD_CLOEXEC and TFD_NONBLOCK
            TFD_CLOEXEC and TFD_NONBLOCK are supported since LInux 2.6.27.

vfork.2
    Michael Kerrisk
        Clarify meaning of "child releases the parent's memory"
            The man page was not explicit about how the memory used by
            the child is released back to the parent.

ctime.3
    Michael Kerrisk
        ctime_r() and localtime_r() need not set 'timezone' and 'daylight'
            The man page already noted that these functions need not set
            'tzname', but things could be clearer: it tzset() is not called,
            then the other two variables also are not set.

            Also, clarify that ctime() does set 'timezone' and 'daylight'.

dlopen.3
    Michael Kerrisk
        LD_LIBRARY_PATH is inspected once, at program start-up
            Make it clear that LD_LIBRARY_PATH is inspected *once*, at
            program start-up.  (Verified from source and by experiment.)

fmemopen.3
    Michael Kerrisk
        Document binary mode (mode 'b')
            Glibc 2.9 adds support to fmemopen() for binary mode opens.
            Binary mode is specified by inclusion of the letter 'b' in
            the 'mode' argument.

getaddrinfo.3
    Michael Kerrisk
        Clarify error descriptions with some examples
            Clarify the description of some errors by giving examples
            that produce the errors.  (Text added for EAI_SERVICE and
            EAI_SOCKTYPE.)

            Also, add an error case for EAI_BADFLAGS.

gethostbyname.3
    Michael Kerrisk
        Rationalize text on POSIX.1-2001 obsolete interfaces
            POSIX.1 marks gethostbyname(), gethostbyaddr(), and 'h_errno'
            as obsolete.  The man page explained this, but with some
            duplication.  Remove the duplication, and otherwise tidy up
            discussion of this point.

popen.3
    Michael Kerrisk
        Change one-line description in NAME
            s%process I/O%pipe stream to or from a process%
    Michael Kerrisk
        Document 'e' (close-on-exec) flag
            glibc 2.9 implements the 'e' flag in 'type', which sets the
            close-on-exec flag on the underlying file descriptor.

raise.3
    Michael Kerrisk
        SEE ALSO: add pthread_kill(3)

readdir.3
    Christoph Hellwig
        Fix text relating to DT_UNKNOWN and 'd_type' support
            (This mirrors the previous change to getdents.2)
            Some file systems provide partial support for 'dt_type',
            returning DT_UNKNOWN for cases they don't support.
            Update the discussion of 'd_type' and DT_UNKNOWN to
            support this.

strcpy.3
    Jason Spiro
        Strengthen warning about checking against buffer overruns
            http://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=413940

tty_ioctl.4
    Michael Kerrisk
        Explain capability requirements for TIOCCONS
            Explain capability requirements for TIOCCONS, and describe
            changes in 2.6.10 relating to capabilities.
    Michael Kerrisk
        Explain capability requirements for various ioctls
            For TIOCSLCKTRMIOS, TIOCSCTTY, TIOCEXCL, explain the exact
            capability that is required (the text formerly just said "root"
            in each case).

proc.5
    Michael Kerrisk
        Document /proc/sys/kernel/threads-max
            Defines the system-wide limit on the number of threads (tasks).

utmp.5
    Pierre Cazenave
        It is just "other" who should not have write perms on utmp
            The page was vague before, saying that utmp should not be
            writable by any user.  This isn't true: it can be, and
            typically is, writable by user and group.

epoll.7
    Michael Kerrisk
        Mention epoll_create1() as part of epoll API
            epoll_create1() was added in Linux 2.6.27, and extends the
            functionality of epoll_create().

inotify.7
    Michael Kerrisk
        Mention inotify_init1() in overview of API
            Discuss the new inotify_init1() system call in the overview of
            the inotify API.

ip.7
    Michael Kerrisk
        Detail EINVAL error for IP_ADD_MEMBERSHIP socket option
            In response to:
            http://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=216092

iso_8859-7.7
    Lefteris Dimitroulakis
        Add Drachma, Euro, and Greek Ypogegrammeni
            Also, amend description of characters 0241 and 0242.

man-pages.7
    Michael Kerrisk
        Example shell sessions should have user input boldfaced

pthreads.7
    Michael Kerrisk
        Describe return value from pthreads functions
            Describe the usual success (0) and failure (non-zero) returns,
            and note that POSIX.1-2001 specifies that pthreads functions
            can never fail with the error EINTR.

signal.7
    Michael Kerrisk
        Timeouts make socket interfaces non-restartable
            If setsockopt() is used to set a timeout on a socket(),
            then the various socket interfaces are not automatically
            restarted, even if SA_RESTART is specified when
            establishing the signal handler.  Analogous behavior occurs
            for the "stop signals" case.

socket.7
    Michael Kerrisk
        SEE ALSO: add unix(7)

ld.so.8
    Michael Kerrisk
        Document LD_USE_LOAD_BIAS
            Drawing heavily on Jakub Jelinek's description in
            http://sources.redhat.com/ml/libc-hacker/2003-11/msg00127.html
            (Subject: [PATCH] Support LD_USE_LOAD_BIAS)
        --inhibit-rpath is ignored for setuid/setgid ld.so
            The --inhibit-rpath option is ignored if ld.so is setuid/setgid
            (not if the executable is setuid/setgid).
    Michael Kerrisk
        Since glibc 2.4, setuid/setgid programs ignore LD_ORIGIN_PATH
    Michael Kerrisk
        Fix description of LD_PROFILE and LD_PROFILE_OUTPUT
            Clarify that LD_PROFILE is pathname or a soname,
            and identify name of profiling output file.
            Fix description of LD_PROFILE_OUTPUT, which wasn't even close to
            the truth.  (But why did it remain unfixed for so many years?)
    Michael Kerrisk
        Since glibc 2.3.4, setuid/setgid programs ignore LD_DYNAMIC_WEAK
    Michael Kerrisk
        Since version 2.3.5, setuid/setgid programs ignore LD_SHOW_AUXV
    Michael Kerrisk
        Reorder lists of LD_* environment variables alphabetically
    Michael Kerrisk
        Since glibc 2.3.4, setuid/setgid programs ignore LD_DEBUG

pthread_attr_setaffinity_np.3
pthread_getattr_np.3
pthread_setaffinity_np.3
pthread_tryjoin_np.3
    Michael Kerrisk
        Explain _np suffix
            Add text to CONFORMING TO explaining that the "_np"
            suffix is because these functions are non-portable.


Changes to individual pages
---------------------------

sched_setaffinity.2
    Michael Kerrisk
        SEE ALSO: add sched_getcpu(3)

sched_setaffinity.2
    Michael Kerrisk
        SEE ALSO: Add pthread_setaffinity_np(3)

sched_setaffinity.2
    Michael Kerrisk
        Clarify EINVAL error for cpusetsize < kernel mask size
            For sched_setaffinity(), the EINVAL error that occurs
            if 'cpusetsize' is smaller than the kernel CPU set size only
            occurs with kernels before 2.6.9.

vfork.2
    Michael Kerrisk
        Child holds parent's memory until execve() or *termination*
            The page was phrased in a few places to describe the child as
            holding the parent's memory until the child does an execve(2)
            or an _exit(2).  The latter case should really be the more
            general process termination (i.e., either _exit(2) or abnormal
            termination).

clock_getres.3
    Michael Kerrisk
        CLOCK_PROCESS_CPUTIME_ID and CLOCK_THREAD_CPUTIME_ID not settable
            According to POSIX.1-2001, the CLOCK_PROCESS_CPUTIME_ID and
            CLOCK_THREAD_CPUTIME_ID clocks should be settable, but
            currently they are not.

pthread_attr_setstacksize.3
    Michael Kerrisk, after a report by Karsten Weiss
        EINVAL occurs on some systems if stacksize != page-size
            On MacOS X at least, pthread_attr_setstacksize(3) can fail
            with EINVAL if 'stacksize' is not a multiple of the system
            page size.  Best to mention this so as to aid people writing
            portable programs.

pthread_create.3
    Karsten Weiss
        Fix bug in EXAMPLE program
            The calloc() line should read like this instead:

                tinfo = calloc(num_threads, sizeof(struct thread_info));

pthread_exit.3
    Michael Kerrisk
        BUGS: thread group with a dead leader and stop signals
            Document the bug that can occur when a stop signal
            is sent to a thread group whose leader has terminated.
            http://thread.gmane.org/gmane.linux.kernel/611611
            http://marc.info/?l=linux-kernel&m=122525468300823&w=2

resolver.3
    Michael Kerrisk
        Fix prototype of dn_expand()
            The 4th argument is "char *", not "unsigned char *".
            http://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=504708

epoll.7
    Michael Kerrisk
        Fix error handling after accept() in example code
            Simply continuing after an error is in most cases wrong,
            and can lead to infinite loops (e.g., for EMFILE).
            So handle an error by terminating.
            http://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=504202

epoll.7
    Michael Kerrisk
        Add error handling for epoll_wait() call in example code

epoll.7
    Michael Kerrisk
        Improve example code
            Fill in some gaps in example code (variable declarations,
            adding listening socket to epoll set).
            Give variables more meaningful names.
            Other minor changes.
            http://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=504202

iso_8859-7.7
    Lefteris Dimitroulakis
        Add characters for Drachma and Greek Ypogegrammeni
            Lines for these two characters were added in the previous patch,
            but the actual characters were not included in the 4th column
            of the table.  This fixes that.

pthreads.7
    Michael Kerrisk
        Add a section describing thread IDs
            In particular, note that in each pthreads function that takes
            a thread ID argument, that ID by definition refers to a thread
            in the same process as the caller.

New and rewritten pages
-----------------------

CPU_SET.3
    Michael Kerrisk
        New page documenting CPU_* macros
            This page contains material moved out of sched_setscheduler(2).
            It overwrites a previously existing link file with the same name.
    Michael Kerrisk
        Add description of macros for dynamically allocated CPU sets
            Add descriptions of CPU_ALLOC(), CPU_ALLOC_SIZE(), CPU_FREE(),
            CPU_SET_S(), CPU_CLR_S(), CPU_ISSET_S(), CPU_ZERO_S(),
            CPU_COUNT_S(), CPU_AND_S(), CPU_OR_S(), CPU_XOR_S(), and
            CPU_EQUAL_S().
    Michael Kerrisk
        Add documentation of CPU_COUNT()
    Michael Kerrisk
        Add description of CPU_AND(), CPU_OR, CPU_XOR(), and CPU_EQUAL()
            Plus a few other small clean-ups of the text
    Michael Kerrisk
        Various improvements in DESCRIPTION
            After review comments by Bert Wesarg:
            * Explain that cpu_set_t is a bitset, but should be considered
              opaque.
            * A CPU set can be duplicated with memset().
            * Size of a CPU set is rounded up to size of long.
            * CPU_SETSIZE is in bits, but the setsize argument is in bytes.
    Michael Kerrisk
        Document CPU_ALLOC()/CPU_ALLOC_SIZE() bug
            These macros return twice what they should because of thinko
            in glibc 2.8 and earlier.  The bug is fixed for glibc 2.9.
            http://sourceware.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=7029
    Michael Kerrisk
        NOTES: Discuss use of types in "prototypes" for these macros
            The SYNOPSIS shows types for arguments and return values, but
            these are really just suggestions: since the interfaces are
            macros, the compiler won't catch all violations of
            the "type rules".  Warn the reader of this.

pthread_attr_setinheritsched.3
    Michael Kerrisk
        New page for pthread_attr_setinheritsched(3) and

Global changes
--------------

clone.2
mount.2
unshare.2
proc.5
path_resolution.7
    Michael Kerrisk
        Global fix: s/namespace/mount-point namespace/, as appropriate
            In recent times, a number of other namespace flags have been
            added to clone(2).  As such, it is no longer clear to use
            the generic term "namespace" to refer to the particular
            namespace controlled by CLONE_NEWNS; instead, use the
            term "mount-point namespace".
    Michael Kerrisk
        Global fix: s/mount-point namespace/mount namespace/
            This is more consistent with the term "mounts namespace"
            used in the 2008 ACM SIGOPS paper, "Virtual servers
            and checkpoint/restart in mainstream Linux".
            (I avoided the "s", because using the plural strikes me
            as klunky English, and anyway we don't talk about
            the "PIDs namespace" or the "networks namespace", etc..)

connect.2
listen.2
send.2
uname.2
cmsg.3
proc.5
arp.7
ddp.7
icmp.7
ip.7
raw.7
socket.7
tcp.7
udp.7
    Michael Kerrisk
        Global fix: eliminate mention of the obsolete sysctl(2) interface
            Many pages still mention use of the obsolete sysctl(2) system
            call, or used the term "sysctls"; rewrite these mentions to
            instead be in terms of /proc interfaces.

fcntl.2
signal.2
mbsnrtowcs.3
mbsrtowcs.3
mbtowc.3
wcrtomb.3
wcsnrtombs.3
wcsrtombs.3
wctomb.3
    Michael Kerrisk
        Global fix: s/multi-thread/multithread/

getdents.2
pthread_attr_init.3
pthread_create.3
pthread_getattr_np.3
pthread_setaffinity_np.3
pthread_setschedparam.3
pthread_tryjoin_np.3
    Michael Kerrisk
        Use consistent error-handling function names
            Many older pages use a handle_error() macro to do simple
            error handling from system and library function calls.
            Switch these pages to do similar.


Changes to individual pages
---------------------------

time.1
    Michael Kerrisk
        Note that some shells have a 'time' built-in command
            Therefore, to access the functionality described on this page,
            it may be necessary to specify the full pathname.

clone.2
    Michael Kerrisk
        Place list of CLONE_* flags in alphabetical order
            (No content changes.)
fsync.2
    Michael Kerrisk
        Update feature test macro requirements for fsync()
            Since glibc 2.8, the fsync() declaration is also exposed if

sched_setaffinity.2
    Michael Kerrisk
        Add note on system-imposed restrictions on CPUs actually used
            After Loïc Domaigne's suggestion for pthread_setaffinity_np(3), add
            similar text to this page noting that the system silently
            limits the set of CPUs on which the process actually runs to
            the set of CPUs physically present and the limits imposed by
            cpuset(7).

sched_setaffinity.2
    Michael Kerrisk
        Removed discussion of CPU_* macros()
            These macros are now moving to a separate page.
    Michael Kerrisk
        Refer reader to pthread_setaffinity_np(3)
            pthread_setaffinity_np() is preferable for setting
            thread CPU affinity if using the POSIX threads API.

sysctl.2
    Michael Kerrisk
        Add prominent warning against using this system call
            This was already stated under NOTES, but make it even more
            prominent by adding a sentence at the start of the DESCRIPTION.

uname.2
    Michael Kerrisk
        Add C comments describing fields in utsname structure

atan2.3
    Stefano Teso
        Fix description of range of function value return
            The range is not [-pi/2, pi/2], but [-pi, pi].

            (mtk: This error was reported by Nicolas François, and
            should have been fixed in 3.11, but somewhere along the way,
            the fix got lost.)

            http://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=506299

bindresvport.3
    Michael Kerrisk
        Since glibc 2.8, EPFNOSUPPORT error is now EAFNOSUPPORT
            Glibc switched to using a POSIX-specified error code for
            this error case.

            http://bugs.linuxbase.org/show_bug.cgi?id=2375

clock_getres.3
    Michael Kerrisk
        CLOCK_PROCESS_CPUTIME_ID and CLOCK_THREAD_CPUTIME_ID not settable
            According to POSIX.1-2001, the CLOCK_PROCESS_CPUTIME_ID and
            CLOCK_THREAD_CPUTIME_ID clocks should be settable, but
            currently they are not.

getgrnam.3
    Michael Kerrisk
        Clarify and add more detail in RETURN VALUE description
            The page was a bit fuzzy in describing the return values for
            various cases.  In particular, it needed to be more explicit
            in describing what happens for the "not found" case.

            This is an analogous change to the change for
            getpwnam.3, made after Andreas Henriksson's report.
            http://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=504787
    Michael Kerrisk
        Rename arguments to getgrnam_r() and getgrgid_r()
            s/gbuf/grp/ and s/gbufp/result/, for consistency
            with POSIX.1 argument names.
    Michael Kerrisk
        Clarify RETURN VALUE description
            The page was a bit fuzzy in describing the return values for
            various cases.  In particular, it needed to be more explicit
            in describing what happens for the "not found" case.

            http://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=504708

getpwnam.3
    Michael Kerrisk
        Rename arguments to getpwnam_r() and getpwuid_r()
            s/pwbuf/pwd/ and s/pwbufp/result/, for consistency
            with POSIX.1 argument names.
    Michael Kerrisk
        Clarify and add more detail in RETURN VALUE description
            The page was a bit fuzzy in describing the return values for
            various cases.  In particular, it needed to be more explicit
            in describing what happens for the "not found" case.

            http://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=504787
    Michael Kerrisk
        Add an EXAMPLE program for getpwnam_r()

inet_ntop.3
    Michael Kerrisk
        Rename 'cnt' argument to 'size'
            This is consistent with POSIX.1, and also a more sensible name.
    Michael Kerrisk
        Rework text describing 'size' argument
            (After a suggestion by Vegard Nossum.)
            Also made a few other small rewordings to in the initial
            paragraph.

makecontext.3
    Michael Kerrisk
        Add text on use of pointer arguments to makecontext()
            Passing pointer arguments to makecontext() is possible,
            but only on some architectures, and with no guarantees
            of portability.

pthread_attr_setaffinity_np.3
pthread_setaffinity_np.3
    Michael Kerrisk
        Update to reflect new location of CPU_*() documentation
            The CPU_*() macros are now documented in CPU_SET.3;
            update to reflect that fact.
    Michael Kerrisk
        Remove redundant text relating to CPU sets
            Information about CPU_SETSIZE can be found in CPU_SET.3, so
            remove discussion of it here.

pthread_attr_setschedparam.3
pthread_setschedparam.3
    Michael Kerrisk
        Remove text saying that only sched_priority is required by POSIX.1
            Loïc Domaigne points out that if a system implements
            SCHED_SPORADIC (which Linux does not), then other
            fields are also specified in sched_param.  The simple
            solution is just to remove that phrase from the man
            page.

        Various improvements after review by Loïc Domaigne
            Various fix-ups after Loïc's review.

            Reviewed-by: Loïc Domaigne

pthread_setschedparam.3
    Michael Kerrisk
        PTHREAD_INHERIT_SCHED is default for inherit scheduler attribute
            In EXAMPLE, note that PTHREAD_INHERIT_SCHED is the default for
            the inherit scheduler attribute.

syslog.3
    Masanari Iida
        LOG_KERN messages can't be generated from user processes
            Masanari notes that this is an FAQ for logger(1) and that
            Solaris and FreeBSD document this point in syslog(3).
            The glibc info page also hides this comment in its source:

                Internally, there is also LOG_KERN, but LOG_KERN == 0,
                which means if you try to use it here, just selects default.

proc.5
    Ivana Varekova
        Fix reference to kernel source file
            Use relative reference to Documentation/mtrr.txt.

icmp.7
    Michael Kerrisk
        Add kernel version numbers to /proc file descriptions

inotify.7
    Vegard Nossum
        Fix description of max_user_watches
            It seems that inotify(7) is wrong here:

            "/proc/sys/fs/inotify/max_user_watches
                This specifies a limit on the number of watches that can be
                associated with each inotify instance."

            On my system, the default value for this variable is 8192. But I
            cannot create more than 8192 watches in total for the same UID
            even when they are on different inotify instances. So I suggest
            to rephrase this as: "This specifies an upper limit on the
            number of watches that can be created per real user ID."

    Michael Kerrisk
        Add section on cancellation points
            This section includes a list of the functions that must and
            may be cancellation points.
    Michael Kerrisk
        Rework, and fix small error in, thread-safe function list
            Integrate the changes that occurred in POSIX.1-2008 into the
            main list (to be consistent with the list, elsewhere on this
            page, of functions that are cancellation points).

            Also, fix an error that said that strerror() was added to
            the list in POSIX.1-2008.  It was strsignal() that was
            added.  (strerror() was already in the list in POSIX.1-2001.)
    Michael Kerrisk
        Tweak text on sigpause() cancellation point
            In POSIX.1-2009, this function moves from the "must be"
            to the "may be" list.
    Michael Kerrisk
        Add ref to signal(7) for further info on use of real-time signals

Changes to individual pages
---------------------------

_exit.2
    Michael Kerrisk
        Since glibc 2.3, the exit() wrapper function invokes exit_group(2)
            This information is useful to users of strace(1).

accept.2
    Michael Kerrisk
        Clarify details when returned address is truncated
            If the returned address is truncated, the 'addrlen' argument
            indicates the actual size of the address, rather than a count
            of the number of bytes in the truncated buffer.

            Also clarify that if 'addr' argument is NULL, then 'addrlen'
            should is unused, and should also be NULL.
    Michael Kerrisk
        Reorder ERRORS list
            Some errors were listed under a separate "may" heading.
            There's probably no real need to do this; integrate
            those errors into the main list.

exit_group.2
    Michael Kerrisk
        Note that since glibc 2.3, exit(2) invokes exit_group()

futex.2
    Michael Kerrisk
        Mention that glibc provides no wrapper function for futex()

get_thread_area.2
    Michael Kerrisk
        Note that glibc provides no wrapper for this system call

getdomainname.2
    Michael Kerrisk
        Substantial rewrite
            Expand description of setdomainname() and getdomainname().
            Note that getdomainname() is implemented as a library function
            in glibc.
            Note limits on size of domain name.
            Reorganize ERRORS list.

gethostname.2
    Michael Kerrisk
        Various parts rewritten
            Write a paragraph describing sethostname().

            Clarify differences between glibc's gethostbyname() and
            the kernel gethostbyname() system calls.

gethostname.2
    Michael Kerrisk
        Note that HOST_NAME_MAX is 64 on Linux
            Also note that in pre-1.0 days, the limit on hostnames
            was 8 bytes.

getpeername.2
    Michael Kerrisk
        Note that returned address may be truncated if buffer is too small

getsid.2
    Michael Kerrisk
        Simplified version information and moved to a new VERSIONS section

getsockname.2
    Michael Kerrisk
        Note that returned address is truncated if buffer is too small

mknod.2
    Michael Kerrisk
        Refer reader to makedev(3) to build a device ID

mmap.2
    Michael Kerrisk
        Loosen language around how 'addr' hint is interpreted
            Mel Gorman reported that in Linux 2.6.27, 'addr' is rounded
            down to a page boundary.

            Before kernel 2.6.26, if 'addr' was taken as a hint, it was
            rounded up to the next page boundary.  Since Linux 2.6.24,
            it is rounded down.  Therefore, loosen the description of
            this point to say that the address is rounded to "a nearby
            page boundary".

open.2
    Michael Kerrisk
        EFBIG error is now EOVERFLOW (since Linux 2.6.24)
            When a 32-bit app opens a file whose size is too big to be
            represented in 31-bits, POSIX.1 specifies the error EOVERFLOW.
            Linux used to give EFBIG for this case, but 2.6.24 fixed this.

            Also, add some text to describe the error scenario in
            more detail.

pread.2
    Michael Kerrisk
        Note that glibc emulation for these calls uses lseek(2)
            (This makes it clearer that the emulated calls are not atomic.)

recv.2
send.2
    Michael Kerrisk
        Make names of "address" and "address length" args more consistent
            Make the names of these arguments more consistent with other
            sockets man pages.

recv.2
    Michael Kerrisk
        Clarify details when returned address is truncated
            If the recvfrom() returned address is truncated, the 'fromlen'
            argument indicates the actual size of the address, rather than
            a count of the number of bytes in the truncated buffer.

            Also clarify that the 'from' argument can be NULL, in which
            case 'fromlen' should is unused, and should also be NULL.
    Michael Kerrisk
        Internet datagram and netlink sockets support MSG_TRUNC for recv(2)
            Internet datagram (since Linux 2.4.27/2.6.8),
            and netlink (since Linux 2.6.22) sockets support
            the MSG_TRUNC flag for recv(2).

select.2
    Michael Kerrisk
        Rewrote text describing feature test macros requirement for pselect()

select_tut.2
    Michael Kerrisk
        Fix SHUT_FD* macros in example program
            Add "do {} while (0)"

set_thread_area.2
    Michael Kerrisk
        Note that glibc provides no wrapper for this system call

setfsgid.2
setfsuid.2
    Michael Kerrisk
        Simplify version information and move to a VERSIONS section

setsid.2
    Michael Kerrisk
        Rework RETURN VALUE section; add an ERRORS section

setup.2
    Michael Kerrisk
        Relocate some CONFORMING TO text to VERSIONS and NOTES

stat.2
    Michael Kerrisk
        Document EOVERFLOW error
    Michael Kerrisk
        Refer reader to major() and minor() to decompose a device ID

syscalls.2
    Michael Kerrisk
        Fix version numbers for a few system calls
            Some 2.6 system calls were wrongly mentioned as also being
            backported into a 2.4.x kernel.

uname.2
    Michael Kerrisk
        DESCRIPTION: Point reader at NOTES for further info on field lengths

atan.3
    Andries E. Brouwer
        Fix return value description
            The correct range for the return value is [-pi/2,pi/2].
            (mtk's fix in the last change to the return value text was
            a botch-up of a (correct) suggestion by Nicolas François.)

atexit.3
    Michael Kerrisk
        atexit() and on_exit(3) register functions on the same list
    Michael Kerrisk
        Terminating registered function using longjmp() is undefined
            According to POSIX.1, using longjmp() to terminate execution of
            a function registered using atexit() produces undefined results.
    Michael Kerrisk
        Calling exit(3) more than once produces undefined results
            If an exit handler itself calls exit(3), the results are
            undefined (see the POSIX.1-2001 specification of exit(3)).
    Michael Kerrisk
        The same exit handler may be registered multiple times

        Calling _exit(2) terminates processing of exit handlers
    Michael Kerrisk
        Terminating registered function using longjmp() is undefined
            According to POSIX.1, using longjmp() to terminate execution of
            a function registered using atexit() produces undefined results.

bindresvport.3
    Mats Wichmann
        SYNOPSIS: s/\*\*/*/ in prototype
    Michael Kerrisk
        Fix errors regarding port used, plus other rewrites
            Glibc's bindresvport() takes no notice of sin->sin_port:
            it always returns an arbitrary reserved port in the
            anonymous range (512-1023).  (Reported by Mats Wichmann.)

            Also:
            * Add EADDRINUSE and EACCES errors.
            * Mention use of getsockname(2).
            * Other minor rewrites and reorderings of the text.
            * Explicitly note that glib's bindresvport() ignores
              sin->sin_port.
            * Change license There's now virtually no text remaining from
              the 1.70 version of this page.

    Michael Kerrisk
        Arg given to registered function is status from *last* call to exit()
            It's a subtle point, but if a registered function itself
            calls exit(3), then subsequent functions that were registered
            with on_exit(3) will see the exit status given to the more
            recent exit(3) call.

            Clean up the $LANGUAGE description, by removing bogus comments

            Maybe you will decide that a more detailed description
            should be left to the gettext(3) documentation, but I
            actually care about the invisible part of the patch more
            since the comments have put me off the track initially
            ($LANGUAGE has nothing to do with setlocale(3) and is
             completely isolated to gettext, as obvious from the
             glibc sources).

        Various minor fixes as per Debian bug 471029
            The relevant pieces of
            http://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=471029 are:

              - Delete duplicate subentry for KEYCTL_CHOWN/KEYCTL_SETPERM
                operations in the CAP_SYS_ADMIN entry.  (It feels like that
                capability entry should be converted to a list, but I've
                left it in semicolon-delimited form for now.)

              - Remove text about ENFILE from the text about the
                /proc/sys/fs/file-max limit in the CAP_SYS_ADMIN entry, since
                this is already described in the man pages for the relevant
                ofile-creating system calls.

              - Correct or clarify a few other bits of grammar and such;
                see the diff file itself for details.

gethostid.3

            Also: rewrite some text describing the /etc/hostid file, so that
            this location is referred to just once on the page.

printf.3
    Michael Kerrisk
        Source and destination buffers may not overlap for *s*printf()
            http://sourceware.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=7075

            Some existing code relies on techniques like the following to
            append text to a buffer:

                $ cat s.c
                #include <stdio.h>
                char buf[80] = "not ";
                main()
                {
                    sprintf(buf, "%sfail", buf);
                puts(buf);
                return 0;
                }

                $ cc s.c
                $ ./a.out
                not fail

            However, the standards say the results are undefined if source
            and destination buffers overlap, and with suitable compiler
            options, recent changes can cause unexpected results:

                $ cc -v 2>&1 | grep gcc
                gcc version 4.3.1 20080507 (prerelease) [gcc-4_3-branch revision 135036] (SUSE Linux)
                $ cc -D_FORTIFY_SOURCE -O2 s.c
                $ ./a.out
                fail

readdir.3
    Michael Kerrisk
        Rewrite text describing 'dirent' fields standardized in POSIX.1
    Michael Kerrisk
        Clarify text for return value/errno setting for end-of-stream case

nscd.8
    Petr Baudis
        Correct NOTES section on reloading configuration files
            It behaved this way at least since
            "Sun Oct 18 15:02:11 1998 +0000",
            some four months after including the nscd implementation
            in glibc. But there does seem to be a short window between
            glibc-2.1 and glibc-2.1.3 when nscd -i was not available,
            I don't think it's worth muddling the point of the page
            with that, though.

            Some other minor rewordings also.

        SEE ALSO: Add getifaddrs(3)

signalfd.2
    Michael Kerrisk
        Fix description of fork() semantics
            The page text described the semantics of the initial
            implementation of signalfd().  These were changed early on,
            but the man page wasn't updated.

byteorder.3
    Michael Kerrisk
        SEE ALSO: add endian(3)

longjmp.3
    Michael Kerrisk
        Clarify wording re saving/restoring signal mask
    Michael Kerrisk
        siglongjmp() restores signal mask iff 'savesigs' was non-zero
            Note that siglongjmp() restores signal mask if, and only
            if, 'savesigs' argument of sigsetjmp() was non-zero.  (Previous
            text omitted the "and only if".)

memccpy.3
    Michael Kerrisk
        Fix CONFORMING TO: s/C99/POSIX.1-2001/

setjmp.3
    Michael Kerrisk
        Clarify wording re saving/restoring signal mask
    Michael Kerrisk
        Clarify when setjmp() provides BSD vs System V signal mask semantics

strsep.3
    Michael Kerrisk
        BUGS: explicitly list problems afflicting strsep()
            Previously, the page said this function suffered the same
            problems as strtok(), but in fact strsep() doesn't suffer
            from all of the same problems as strtok(), so explicitly
            list just the problems of strsep() in the strsep.3 page.

proc.5
    Michael Kerrisk
        Add pointer to epoll(7) for description of epoll /proc files

epoll.7
    Michael Kerrisk
        Various wording changes to improve clarity and consistency

            The POSIX timers API is implemented (mostly) within the kernel,
            so these interfaces are system calls.  Although there are as yet
            no man pages, when they are added they should be in Section 2,
            not 3.  Therefore fix those pages that currently refer to these
            interfaces as being in Section 3.


Changes to individual pages
---------------------------

capget.2
    Andi Kleen
        Add some details and relocate a paragraph
            While writing a little program using capset
            I found the capset manpage quite light on crucial
            details and I had to resort to RTFS.

            This patch improves the points I found unclear
            and also moves one misplaced paragraph around.

clock_getres.2
    Michael Kerrisk
        Move page from Section 3 to Section 2

eventfd.2
    Michael Kerrisk
        glibc eventfd() supports the use of eventfd2() since version 2.9

fork.2
    Michael Kerrisk
        SEE ALSO: add daemon(3)

getdents.2
    Michael Kerrisk
        Remove unneeded HAVE_D_TYPE from example program
            Since d_type will always just return DT_UNKNOWN before
            kernel 2.6.4, we don't need to use a conditional for
            determining whether we use this flag.

nanosleep.2
    Michael Kerrisk
        Relocated misplaced BUGS heading

select_tut.2
    Michael Kerrisk
        Clean up error checking in example program (no semantic changes)

        Many parts tidied and rewritten
            Remove some redundant text, clarify various pieces,
            tidy example code, etc.
    Michael Kerrisk
        Bug fixes + rewrites in example program
            Sebastien pointed out that the first example program
            wrongly thinks it can count signals.
            Also, some further rewrites by mtk.

socket.2
    Michael Kerrisk
        BUGS: Remove discussion SOCK_UUCP
            As time goes on, this sentence becomes less a piece of humor,
            and more a puzzle.

stat.2
    Michael Kerrisk
        Note that open(O_NOATIME) also causes st_atime not to be updated

Various pages
    Kir Kolyshkin
        Trivial punctuation fixes in SEE ALSO
            In SEE ALSO, when a few man pages are referenced, those
            are divided by commas.  Every reference is on a separate
            line, and all lines but the last one should end with
            comma. I spotted one place where there is no comma in
            between references, and mocked up an awk script to find
            similar places:

            for f in man*/*; do
                awk '
                    /^.SH ["]SEE ALSO["]/ {
                        sa=1; print "== " FILENAME " =="; print; next
                    }
                    /^\.(PP|SH)/ {
                        sa=0; no=0; next
                    }
                    /^\.BR/ {
                        if (sa==1) {
                            print;
                            if (no == 1)
                                print "Missing comma in " FILENAME " +" FNR-1; no=0
                        }
                    }
                    /^\.BR .*)$/ {
                        if (sa==1)
                            no=1;
                        next
                    }
                    /\.\\"/ {next}
                    /.*/ {
                        if (sa==1) {
                            print; next
                        }
                    }
                ' $f;
            done | fgrep 'Missing comma'

            This patch fixes all the places found by the above script.

            Also, there is an extra dot at the end of uri.7 "SEE ALSO"
            section.  Removed as per man-pages(7) recommendation.

        ERRORS: Add EINVAL case for file opened O_APPEND
            Target file cannot be opened in append (O_APPEND) mode

            In kernels prior to v2.6.27 splice() to a file in
            append mode is broken, and since that version it is
            disallowed. It is possible this behaviour may change
            in the future; see the kernel commit message
            (efc968d450e013049a662d22727cf132618dcb2f) for more
            information.

    Michael Kerrisk
        Make source layout of 'Link with' text consistent with other pages
            No actual change to formatted output, but this makes the
            page sources more consistent for the purpose of grepping, etc.

mempcpy.3
signbit.3
significand.3
    Michael Kerrisk
        Global fix: acknowledge FSF in copyright
            These pages are heavily based on original material in
            glibc info pages, but the comments in the source of the pages
            did not acknowledge the FSF copyright on the original material.
            Fix that.

accept.2

write.2
    Michael Kerrisk
        Fix discussion of EAGAIN/EWOULDBLOCK errors
            For a non-blocking socket, POSIX.1-2001/2008 allow either
            EAGAIN or EWOULDBLOCK to be returned in cases where a call
            would have blocked.  Although these constants are defined
            with the same value on most Linux architectures (PA-RISC
            is the exception), POSIX.1 does not require them to have
            the same value.  Therefore, a portable application using
            the sockets API should test for both errors when checking
            this case.

            (NB POSIX.1 only mentions EWOULDBLOCK in the context of
            the sockets interfaces.)

            Change made after a note cross-posted on linux-arch@vger,
            http://thread.gmane.org/gmane.linux.debian.ports.hppa/5615
            and a suggestion for write(2) from Carlos O'Donell

        Add explicit character set encoding to first line of source
            Nowadays mandb has provision to understand a character set
            encoding that is explicitly indicated in the first line
            of the source.  As pointed out by Colin Watson, including
            such an explicit indication on pages encoded in anything
            other than ISO 8859-1 or UTF-8 is useful for man-pages
            that aren't shipped in UTF-8.

            See http://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=519209
            and for some other background (responded to by Colin Watson

Changes to individual pages
---------------------------

fallocate.2
    Michael Kerrisk
        VERSIONS: glibc support is provided since version 2.10

fcntl.2
    Michael Kerrisk
        Remove mention of EWOULDBLOCK from discussion of mandatory locking
            In the kernel, the error on encountering a mandatory lock is
            EAGAIN.  Although EAGAIN and EWOULDBLOCK are the same on
            most Linux architectures, on some they are not, so don't
            mention EWOULDBLOCK as it is misleading.  (Mea culpa.)

getcontext.2
    Michael Kerrisk
        Note that POSIX.1-2008 removes the specification of getcontext()

getitimer.2
    Michael Kerrisk
        Note that POSIX.1-2008 recommends POSIX timers API instead of this API

gettimeofday.2
    Michael Kerrisk
        Note that POSIX.1-2008 recommends clock_gettime() instead of this API

ptrace.2
    Michael Kerrisk
        Note use of 'data' for PTRACE_SYS{CALL,EMU} and PTRACE_*_SINGLESTEP
            These operations use the 'data' argument as a signal number,
            like PTRACE_CONT.

ptrace.2
    Mike Frysinger
        only reference <sys/user.h>
            The kernel no longer installs linux/user.h, so update
            references to sys/user.h.

recv.2
    Michael Kerrisk
        Add 'iovec' defn to defn of 'msghdr' structure
            The 'msghdr' structure includes a field of type 'iovec',
            so show the definition of that structure in this page.

rename.2
    Michael Kerrisk
        Make ENOENT description consistent with POSIX.1-2008

timerfd_create.2
    Michael Kerrisk
        ERRORS: add EINVAL for invalid 'flags' for timer_settime()

truncate.2
    Michael Kerrisk
        SYNOPSIS: Fix description of feature test macro requirements
            After a report by Arvid Norlander.

bcopy.3
    Michael Kerrisk
        Note that POSIX.1-2008 removes specification of bcopy()

bsd_signal.3
    Michael Kerrisk
        Note that POSIX.1-2008 recommends sigaction(2) instead of this API

ctime.3
    Michael Kerrisk
        Note that POSIX.1-2008 recommends strftime(3) instead of these functions

ecvt.3
    Michael Kerrisk
        Note that POSIX.1-2008 recommends sprintf(3) instead of these functions

gcvt.3
    Michael Kerrisk
        Note that POSIX.1-2008 recommends sprintf(3) instead of this function

getcwd.3
    Michael Kerrisk
        Note that getcwd() should be used instead of the obsolete getwd()

getgrent.3
    Michael Kerrisk
        Returned buffer may be statically allocated and overwritten by
        later calls

gethostbyname.3
    Michael Kerrisk
        POSIX.1-2008 recommends getaddrinfo(3) and getnameinfo(3) instead

getnetent_r.3
    Michael Kerrisk
        Fix function name in text: s/getnetbynumber_r/getnetbyaddr_r/
            The SYNOPSIS showed the right function name (getnetbyaddr_r),
            but the text repeatedly used the wrong name (getnetbynumber_r).
            Probably, this was a cut-and-paste error.

getpwent.3
    Michael Kerrisk
        Returned buffer may be statically allocated and overwritten by
        later calls

index.3
    Michael Kerrisk
        Note that POSIX.1-2008 recommends strchr(3) and strrchr(3) instead

isalpha.3
    Michael Kerrisk
        Explain why POSIX.1-2008 marks isascii(3) obsolete

lockf.3
    Nikanth Karthikesan
        Update pointer to documentation in kernel source

makecontext.3
    Michael Kerrisk
        Note that POSIX.1-2008 recommends the use of POSIX threads instead

mq_notify.3
    Michael Kerrisk
        Document the POSIX.1-2008 optional EINVAL error
            POSIX.1-2008 allows an optional EINVAL error if
            notification==NULL and the caller is not currently
            registered to receive notifications.

posix_fallocate.3
    Michael Kerrisk
        Clarify that EINVAL also occurs of 'len' *equals* zero
            See http://bugzilla.kernel.org/show_bug.cgi?id=12919

posix_fallocate.3
    Michael Kerrisk
        Document POSIX.1-2001 and POSIX.1-2008 specifications for EINVAL error

realpath.3
    Michael Kerrisk
        Rework resolved_path==NULL discussion w.r.t. POSIX.1-200[18]
            Although the page already mentioned the resolved_path==NULL
            feature, and that this feature was added in POSIX.1-2008, there
            was still some crufty text in BUGS that hadn't been updated to
            reflect the POSIX.1-2008 changes.

            Also, some other minor wording and grammar fixes.

scalb.3
    Michael Kerrisk
        Note that POSIX.1-2008 recommends scalbln*(3) instead

seekdir.3
    Michael Kerrisk
        SYNOPSIS: Fix type of 'offset' argument: s/off_t/long/
            And add a NOTES section pointing out that 'off_t'
            was indeed used in glibc 2.1.1 and earlier.
            See http://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=519230

sem_post.3
    Michael Kerrisk
        Document EOVERFLOW error

shm_open.3
    Michael Kerrisk
        Recast discussion on name length to exclude terminating NULL byte
            Probably it's clearer to describe the length of the IPC object
            name as a count that excludes the null terminator.

siginterrupt.3
    Michael Kerrisk
        Note that POSIX.1-2008 recommends sigaction() instead

sigset.3
    Michael Kerrisk
        Note APIs that POSIX.1-2008 recommends instead of these obsolete APIs

strftime.3
    Michael Kerrisk
        Small fix to description of %G
            See http://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=516677

strftime.3
    Michael Kerrisk
        Add details on ISO 8601 week-based dates
            ISO 8602 week-based dates are relevant for %G, %g, and %V,
            and the existing details on these dates are a little thin.

strftime.3
    Michael Kerrisk
        Remove mention of year from ISO 8601 standard
            The text mentioned the 1988 8601 standard, but there have
            already been two revisions of the standard since then, so
            simply remove mention of the year.

telldir.3
    Michael Kerrisk
        SYNOPSIS: Fix return type: s/off_t/long/
            And add a NOTES section pointing out that 'off_t'
            was indeed used in glibc 2.1.1 and earlier.
            See http://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=519230

timeradd.3
    Michael Kerrisk
        Note that on some systems, <=, >=, == don't work for timercmp()

timeradd.3
    Michael Kerrisk
        SYNOPSIS: Fix return types of timerisset() and timercmp()

toascii.3
    Michael Kerrisk
        Note why POSIX.1-2008 marks this function obsolete

resolv.conf.5
    Michael Kerrisk
        Note that maximum value of 'timeout' option is capped to 30

hier.7
    Michael Kerrisk
        Add description of /srv
            See http://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=520904

ip.7
    Michael Kerrisk
        Fix type used to declare sin6_port
            The page should use the type specified by POSIX,
            rather than the (equivalent) type used in the kernel

ipv6.7
    Teddy Hogeborn
        Fix types used to declare sin6_family and sin6_port
            The page should use the types specified by POSIX,
            rather than the (equivalent) types used in the kernel.

            See http://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=517074

mq_overview.7
    Michael Kerrisk
        Recast discussion on name length to exclude terminating NULL byte
            Probably it's clearer to describe the length of the IPC object
            name as a count that excludes the null terminator.

rtld-audit.7
    Michael Kerrisk
        Note that multiple libraries in LD_AUDIT doesn't work
            This is reportedly fixed in glibc 2.10.
            See http://sourceware.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=9733

sem_overview.7
    Michael Kerrisk
        Fix discussion of length of semaphore names
            Because of the "sem." prefix added by glibc to a semaphore
            name, the limit on the length of the name (excluding the
            terminating null byte) is 251 characters.

Changes to individual pages
---------------------------

clone.2
    Michael Kerrisk
        Rewrite crufty text about number of args in older version of clone()
                Some bit rot had crept in regarding the discussion of the
                number of arguments in older versions of this syscall.
                Simplify the text to just say that Linux 2.4 and earlier
                didn't have ptid, tls, and ctid arguments.

                See http://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=533868
    Michael Kerrisk
        Fix version number for CLONE_NEWIPC
            It's 2.6.19, not 2.4.19.
    Michael Kerrisk
        Fix errors in argument names in text (ptid, ctd)

execve.2
    Mike Frysinger
        Remove erroneous statement that pending signal set is cleared
        on execve(2).

fcntl.2
    Michael Kerrisk
        The kernel source file mandatory.txt is now mandatory-locking.txt
    Michael Kerrisk
        The Documentation/* files are now in Documentation/filesystems

flock.2
    Michael Kerrisk
        Remove unneeded reference to Documentation/mandatory.txt
            Mandatory locks are only implemented by fcntl() locking
    Michael Kerrisk
        The Documentation/* files are now in Documentation/filesystems

fork.2
    Jeff Moyer
        Document fork() behaviour for the Linux native AIO io_context
            It was noted on lkml that the fork behaviour is documented
            for the POSIX AIO calls, but not for the Linux native calls.
            Here is a patch which adds a small blurb that folks will
            hopefully find useful.

            Upon fork(), the child process does not inherit the
            io_context_t data structures returned by io_setup,
            and thus cannot submit further asynchronous I/O or
            reap event completions for said contexts.

getdents.2
    Michael Kerrisk
        The d_type field is fully supported on Btrfs

mount.2
    Michael Kerrisk
        Document MS_STRICTATIME, update description of MS_RELATIME
            Starting with Linux 2.6.30, the MS_RELATIME behavior became
            the default, and MS_STRICTATIME is required to obtain the
            traditional semantics.

poll.2
    Michael Kerrisk
        Remove EBADF error from ERRORS
            As reported by Motohiro:

            "man poll" describe this error code.

            >ERRORS
            > EBADF  An invalid file descriptor was given in one of the sets.

            but current kernel implementation ignore invalid file descriptor,
            not return EBADF.
            ...

            In the other hand, SUSv3 talk about

            > POLLNVAL
            >  The specified fd value is invalid. This flag is only valid in the
            >  revents member; it shall ignored in the events member.

            and

            > If the value of fd is less than 0, events shall be ignored, and
            > ireevents shall be set to 0 in that entry on return from poll().

            but, no desribe EBADF.
            (see http://www.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/009695399/functions/poll.html)

            So, I think the implementation is correct.

            Why don't we remove EBADF description?

sigaction.2
    Michael Kerrisk
        Expand description of si_utime and si_stime fields of siginfo_t

stat.2
    Michael Kerrisk
        Improve wording of ENOTDIR error

syscalls.2
    Michael Kerrisk
        Add preadv() and pwritev(), new in kernel 2.6.30

wait.2
    Gokdeniz Karadag
        Document CLD_DUMPED and CLD_TRAPPED si_code values

daemon.3
    Michael Kerrisk
        Clarify discussion of 'noclose' and 'nochdir' arguments

ffs.3
    Petr Baudis
        SEE ALSO: add memchr(3)

fmemopen.3
    Petr Baudis
        Relocate BUGS section to correct position
    Petr Baudis
        NOTES: there is no file descriptor associated with the returned stream
            Alexander Lamaison pointed out that this is not obvious
            from the documentation, citing an example with passing the
            FILE * handle to a function that tries to fstat() its
            fileno() in order to determine the buffer size.
    Michael Kerrisk
        CONFORMING TO: remove note that these functions are GNU extensions
            That sentence is now redundant, since these functions
            are added in POSIX.1-2008.

lockf.3
    Michael Kerrisk
        Clarify relationship between fcntl() and lockf() locking

memchr.3
    Petr Baudis
        SEE ALSO: add ffs(3)

readdir.3
    Michael Kerrisk
        The d_type field is fully supported on Btrfs

setjmp.3
    Mike Frysinger
        Fix typo and clarify RETURN description
            The word "signal" was duplicated in NOTES, and the RETURN
            section refers to setjmp() and sigsetjmp(), and mentions
            longjmp(), but not siglongjmp().

strcmp.3
    Petr Baudis
        SEE ALSO: add strverscmp(3)

strcpy.3
    Mark Hills
        SEE ALSO: Add strdup(3)

complex.7
    Michael Kerrisk
        Add missing header file for example program
    Reimar Döffinger
        Fix type used in example code
        man complex (from release 3.18) contains the following code:
            complex z = cexp(I * pi);
        Reading the C99 standard, "complex" is not a valid type,
        and several compilers (Intel ICC, ARM RVCT) will refuse to compile.
        It should be
            double complex z = cexp(I * pi); instead.

environ.7
    Michael Kerrisk
        Note that last element in environ array is NULL
            See http://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=528628
    Michael Kerrisk
        Wording fixes

mq_overview.7
    Michael Kerrisk
        Note that mkdir and mount commands here need superuser privilege
    Michael Kerrisk
        Fix example showing contents of /dev/mqueue file

standards.7
    Michael Kerrisk
        Remove references to dated books
            Gallmeister and Lewine are rather old books. Probably,
            there are better books to consult nowadays, and anyway,
            this man page isn't intended to be a bibliography.

Changes to individual pages
---------------------------

execve.2
pipe.2
tee.2
fmemopen.3
mq_notify.3
qsort.3
    Michael Kerrisk
        Replace use of assert() by code that checks argc
            See http://bugzilla.kernel.org/show_bug.cgi?id=13569

            As noted by Andrey:
            The purpose of the assert macro, defined in <assert.h>,
            is to provide a tool to check for programming mistakes
            or program logic errors. However, the assert macro must
            never be used to perform checks for run time errors,
            since, with the NDEBUG macro defined, expressions within
            the assert macro invocations are not evaluated/checked
            for, resulting in behavior that was not originally intended.
            ...
            The pages affected in the core package are

            execve(2)
            pipe(2)
            tee(2)
            fmemopen(3)
            mq_notify(3)
            qsort(3)

getrusage.2
    Michael Kerrisk
        ru_inblock and ru_oublock are now implemented
            These fields of the rusage structure are filled in since
            Linux 2.6.22.

mmap.2
    Michael Kerrisk
        Add brief documentation of MAP_HUGETLB
            This flag is new in 2.6.32, and serves a similar
            purpose to the shmget() SHM_HUGETLB flag.

open.2
    Christoph Hellwig
        add some comments on O_SYNC and friends

poll.2
    Michael Kerrisk
        Clarify wording describing of 'nfds' argument.
            reported by: rui rlex <rui.rlex@gmail.com>

semctl.2
    Nicolas François
        Remove some redundant words

setpgid.2
    Michael Kerrisk
        Add an explanation of orphaned process groups

splice.2
tee.2
vmsplice.2
    Mark Hills
        Fix return type
            Since glibc 2.7, the return type for these functions
            is ssize_t (formerly it was long).

stat.2
    Nicolas François
        Fix small bug in example program
            Since it is a failure, EXIT_FAILURE looks more appropriate
            than EXIT_SUCCESS.

umount.2
    Michael Kerrisk
        glibc only exposes MNT_DETACH and MNT_EXPIRE since version 2.11
            See http://sourceware.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=10092

exit.3
    Michael Kerrisk
        Add a pointer to explanation of orphaned process groups in setpgid(2)

fflush.3
    Michael Kerrisk
        fflush() discards buffered input

ffs.3
    Michael Kerrisk
        Clarify that ffsl() and ffsll() are GNU extensions

getaddrinfo.3
    Michael Kerrisk
        Note nonstandard assumed hints.ai_flags value when hints is NULL
            When hints is NULL, glibc assumes hints.ai_flags is
            AI_V4MAPPED|AI_ADDRCONFIG whereas POSIX says 0.
            According to Ulrich Drepper, glibc's behavior is better.

getmntent.3
    Mike Frysinger
        setmntent() argument is 'filename' not 'fp'
            The description of setmntent() formerly used the wrong
            argument name.

posix_fallocate.3
    Nicolas François
        Fix reference to POSIX.1-2008
            The sentence mentions twice POSIX.1-2001.
            I guess the second one should be POSIX.1-2008.
            This should be checked in the standard.

setenv.3
    Michael Kerrisk
        Improve ERRORS section
            Add ENOMEM error; improve EINVAL description. Also, make
            RETURN VALUE section a little more accurate in its mention
            of errno.

strftime.3
    Nicolas François
        Fix error in description: s/Monday/Thursday/

proc.5
    Nicolas François
        Fix page cross reference
            max_user_watches is better explained in epoll(7) than inotify(7).

proc.5
    Michael Kerrisk
        dmesg is in section 1, not section 8

capabilities.7
    Michael Kerrisk
        FS UID manipulations affect CAP_LINUX_IMMUTABLE and CAP_MKNOD
            Nowadays, file system UID manipulations also affect
            CAP_LINUX_IMMUTABLE (since 2.6.3) and CAP_MKNOD (since 2.6.29).

capabilities.7
    Michael Kerrisk
        Fix version number for CAP_MKNOD in FS UID manipulations
            A recent patch said "since 2.6.29". It should have
            been "since 2.6.30".

        s/non-/non/
            The tendency in English, as prescribed in style guides like
            Chicago MoS, is toward removing hyphens after prefixes
            like "non-" etc.

        Global fix: Consistently define the Epoch
            All definitions of the Epoch have been refactored to the following:

              1970-01-01 00:00:00 +0000 (UTC)

            That form is more consistent, logical, precise, and internationally
            recognizable than the other variants.

            Also, some wording has been altered as well.

            or _POSIX_C_SOURCE >= 200809 exposes the declarations of
            these functions.


Changes to individual pages
---------------------------

clock_getres.2
    Michael Kerrisk
        Update text on nonsetabble CLOCK_*_CPUTIME_ID clocks
            SUSv3 permits, but does not require CLOCK_THREAD_CPUTIME_ID and
            CLOCK_PROCESS_CPUTIME_ID to be settable.
            See http://bugzilla.kernel.org/show_bug.cgi?id=11972.

execve.2
    Colin Watson
        Fix description of treatment of caught signals
            Caught signals reset to their default on an execve() (not
            to being ignored).

fcntl.2
    Michael Kerrisk
        s/F_OWNER_GID/F_OWNER_PGRP/
            Peter Zijlstra took the name change I suggested.
    Michael Kerrisk
        Document F_[SG]ETOWN_EX; update details on F_SETOWN
            Linux 2.6.32 adds F_SETOWN_EX and F_GETOWN_EX.
            Linux 2.6.12 changed (broke) the former behavior of
            F_SETOWN with respect to threads.

intro.2
intro.3
    Michael Kerrisk
        Make subsection heading consistent with other intro.? pages
            These pages used "Copyright Terms"; the other intro.? pages
            used "Copyright Conditions". Make these pages like the others.

sendfile.2
    Michael Kerrisk
        Clarify behavior when 'offset' is NULL

seteuid.2
    Michael Kerrisk
        Note unstandardized behavior for effective ID
            POSIX.1 doesn't require that the effective ID can be changed
            to the same value it currently has (a no-op). The man page
            should note this, since some other implementations
            don't permit it.

setgid.2
    Michael Kerrisk
        Fix EPERM error description
            s/effective group ID/real group ID/
            This bug lived in man pages for 15 years before Jason
            spotted it! I checked back in Linux 1.0, and the behavior
            was as the fixed man page describes.

setreuid.2
    Michael Kerrisk
        Add more detail on POSIX.1 specification for these syscalls

setuid.2
    Michael Kerrisk
        Remove crufty statement that seteuid() is not in POSIX
            See http://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=569812

stime.2
strftime.3
tzset.3
zic.8
    Michael Witten
        GMT -> UTC (where appropriate)

sync_file_range.2
    Christoph Hellwig
        Add some big warnings re data integrity
            This system call is by design completely unsuitable for any data
            integrity operations.  Make that very clear in the manpage.

CPU_SET.3
    Vlastimil Babka
        SYNOPSIS: Fix return types for CPU_COUNT_*()
            These functions return 'int' not void'.

confstr.3
    Michael Kerrisk
        Fix feature test macro requirements

daemon.3
    Michael Kerrisk
        Fix description of 'nochdir' argument.
            http://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=554819

gethostbyname.3
    Michael Kerrisk
        Document feature test macro requirements for herror() and hstrerror()
            Since glibc 2.8, one of _BSD_SOURCE, _SVID_SOURCE,
            or _GNU_SOURCE is required.

getline.3
    Michael Kerrisk
        Update to reflect that these functions were standardized in POSIX.1-2008

getnameinfo.3
    Michael Kerrisk
        Document feature test macros requirements for NI_MAXHOST and NI_MAXSERV
            Since glibc 2.8, one of _BSD_SOURCE, _SVID_SOURCE, or _GNU_SOURCE
            must be defined to obtain these definitions.

getopt.3
    Jonathan Nieder
        Fix feature test macro requirements

memchr.3
    Michael Kerrisk
        Add feature text macro requirements for memrchr()

nextafter.3
    Michael Kerrisk
        Fix notable error in DESCRIPTION.
        "less than y" should be "less than x".

popen.3
    Michael Kerrisk
        Fix feature test macro requirements

pthread_attr_setdetachstate.3
pthread_attr_setschedparam.3
pthread_attr_setschedpolicy.3
    Denis Barbier
        Argument name is 'attr' not 'thread'
            The function argument was misnamed in the DESCRIPTION on these
            three pages.

rtnetlink.3
    Michael Kerrisk
        Various fixes in example code
            Edward reported a problem in the example code, where a variable
            seems to be misnamed. Upon inspection, there seem to be a few
            such instances, and this patch is my best guess at how things
            should look.

sched_getcpu.3
    Michael Kerrisk
        Place correct header file in SYNOPSIS

sleep.3
    Bill O. Gallmeister
        sleep() puts calling *thread* to sleep (not calling *process*)

sleep.3
    Bill O. Gallmeister
        Add nanosleep(2) to SEE ALSO

strftime.3
    Michael Kerrisk
        %z is defined in SUSv3
            So, substitute "GNU" tag in man page by "SU".

strftime.3
    Michael Witten
        Move 822-compliant date format example to EXAMPLES section
            The RFC 822-compliant date format given in the description
            of `%z' is now moved to the `EXAMPLES' section (note: `EXAMPLE'
            has been renamed `EXAMPLES').

            Furthermore, that format example is now actually
            RFC 822-compliant (using `%y' instead of `%Y') and has been
            qualified as being correct only when in the context of at least
            an English locale. Also, `%T' is used in place of `%H:%M:%S'.

            For completeness, an RFC 2822-compliant format example has been
            similarly added.

strftime.3
    Michael Witten
        Expand introductory text

strftime.3
    Michael Witten
        Clarification of %z specifier

string.3
    Mark Hills
        Add stpcpy() to this list of string functions

strptime.3
    Michael Kerrisk
        Initialize tm structure in example program

undocumented.3
    Michael Kerrisk
        Remove pages now documented
            By now, the following are documented:

                fopencookie(3)
                freeifaddrs(3)
                rawmemchr(3)
                readdir_r(3)
                getutmp(3)
                getutmpx(3)
                utmpxname(3)

            http://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=554819

group.5
    Michael Kerrisk
        s/passwd/password/
            The page inconsistently used "passwd" and "password"
            to refer to the same field.

capabilities.7
    Michael Kerrisk
        Update securebits discussion to use SECBIT_* flags

feature_test_macros.7
    Michael Kerrisk
        _POSIX_C_SOURCE >= 200808 defines _ATFILE_SOURCE
            Since glibc 2.10, _POSIX_C_SOURCE >= 200808 defines _ATFILE_SOURCE

path_resolution.7
    Michael Kerrisk
        Add readlink(2) to SEE ALSO
    Michael Kerrisk
        Fix NAME line
            The poorly constructed part preceding "\-" causes apropos
            not to be able to find the subject.

            http://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=558300

signal.7
    Michael Kerrisk
        Fix discussion of SIGUNUSED
            Clarify that this signal really is synonymous with SIGSYS.
            See http://bugzilla.kernel.org/show_bug.cgi?id=14449

New and rewritten pages
-----------------------

migrate_pages.2
    Andi Kleen
        New page documenting migrate_pages(2).
            Andi's text based on the move_pages.2 page;

quotactl.2
    Jan Kara
        Major updates

Global changes
--------------

open.2
sync_file_range.2
umount.2
    Michael Kerrisk
        Global fix: s/filesystem/file system/


Changes to individual pages
---------------------------

fcntl.2
    Michael Kerrisk
        Note that glibc 2.11 papers over the kernel F_GETOWN bug
            Since version 2.11, glibc works around the kernel limitation for
            process groups IDs < 4096 by implementing F_GETOWN via F_GETOWN_EX.

futex.2
    Michael Kerrisk
        Various fixes in SEE ALSO

getpriority.2
nice.2
    Francesco Cosoleto
        Move renice from section 8 to section 1

    Mark Hills
        Add ru_maxrss
            See kernel commit 1f10206.

            These descriptions are taken from NetBSD 5.0's getrusage(2).
    Michael Kerrisk
        Enhanced description of various fields

mlock.2
    Michael Kerrisk
        /proc/PID/status VmLck shows how much memory a process has locked
            After a note from Tom Swigg, it seems sensible mention VmLck here.

poll.2
    Michael Kerrisk
        Fix discussion of ppoll() timeout argument
            1. Rename ppoll)(_ argument to "timeout_ts" to distinguish it
               from the poll() argument in the text.
            2. More accurately describe the poll() call that is equivalent
               to ppoll().

posix_fadvise.2
    Michael Kerrisk
        Add sync_file_range(2) under SEE ALSO

prctl.2
    Michael Kerrisk
        Correct PR_SET_KEEPCAPS description
            The "keep capabilities" flag only affects the treatment of
            permitted capabilities, not effective capabilities.
            Also: other improvements to make the PR_SET_KEEPCAPS text clearer.

select_tut.2

    Fang Wenqi
        Add definition EXT4_SUPER_MAGIC = 0xEF53
    Michael Kerrisk
        Document f_frsize field.

statvfs.2
    Michael Kerrisk
        Move this page to section 3 (since it's a library call)

swapon.2
    Ivana Hutarova Varekova
        Note effect of CONFIG_MEMORY_FAILURE on MAX_SWAPFILES
            From 2.6.32, MAX_SWAPFILES is decreased by 1 if the kernel is
            built with CONFIG_MEMORY_FAILURE.

syscalls.2
    Michael Kerrisk
        Bring system call list up to date with Linux 2.6.33
    Michael Kerrisk
        Fix kernel version number for utimes()

cproj.3
    Michael Kerrisk
        Note fix for C99 conformance in glibc 2.12.

crypt.3
    Petr Baudis
        Correct note on key portion significance
            As Marcel Moreaux notes:

                The Linux manpage for crypt()[1] contains the following
                statement as the last sentence of the NOTES section:

                    In the SHA implementation the entire key is significant
                    (instead of only the first 8 bytes in MD5).

                It should probably say "DES" where it says "MD5" (and maybe
                "MD5/SHA" where it says "SHA"), because in MD5 password hashing,
                the entire key is significant, not just the first 8 bytes.

            This patch fixes the wording.

fmemopen.3
    Michael Kerrisk
        Bug fix in example program

ftw.3
    Michael Kerrisk
        Note that if 'fn' changes CWD, the results are undefined
    Michael Kerrisk
        Clarify description of fpath argument
            As reported by Pierre Habouzit, 'fpath' is not relative
            to 'dirpath'. It is either relative to the calling process's
            current working directory (if 'dirpath' was relative), or it
            is absolute (if 'dirpath' was absolute).

getaddrinfo.3
    Christian Franke
        Fix a field name mixup: s/ai_family/ai_flags/

getline.3
    Robert Wohlrab
        Remove unneeded check before free()
            The manpage of getline shows an example with an extra NULL pointer
            check before it calls free. This is unneeded according to free(3):

                 If ptr is NULL, no operation is performed.

            This patch removes the "if" check.

            See http://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=572508

log.3
log10.3
log2.3
    Jan Engelhardt
        Add cross-references to other-base logarithmic functions

opendir.3
    Petr Baudis
        Specify feature test macro requirements for fdopendir(3)
            Currently, there is no note on the fact that fdopendir() is
            POSIX.2008-only.

openpty.3
    Eric Blake
        Use const as appropriate
    Michael Kerrisk
        Note glibc version that added "const" to function arguments
    Michael Kerrisk
        Explicitly note that these functions are not in POSIX

resolver.3
    Michael Kerrisk
        Fix declaration of dn_comp() in SYNOPSIS
            Remove the second 'exp_dn' from the calling signature.

termios.3
    Michael Kerrisk
        Change NOFLSH text to speak of characters, not signals

core.5
    Michael Kerrisk
        Update description of coredump_filter
            Kernel 2.6.24 added MMF_DUMP_ELF_HEADERS.
            Kernel 2.6.28 added MMF_DUMP_HUGETLB_PRIVATE and
            MMF_DUMP_HUGETLB_SHARED.

elf.5
    Daisuke HATAYAMA
        Document PN_XNUM extension
            In linux-2.6.34-rc1, an ELF core extension was added; user-land
            tools manipulating ELF core dump such as gdb and binutils has
            already been modified before; so elf.5 needs to be modified
            accordingly.

            You can follow information on the ELF extension via the LKML post:
            http://lkml.org/lkml/2010/1/3/103
            Date        Mon, 04 Jan 2010 10:06:07 +0900 (JST)
            Subject     ... elf coredump: Add extended numbering support

            This Linux-specific extension was added in kernel 2.6.34.

        Remove EI_BRAND
            As reported by Yuri Kozlov  and confirmed by Mike Frysinger,
            EI_BRAND is not in GABI
            (http://www.sco.com/developers/gabi/latest/ch4.eheader.html)
            It looks to be a BSDism
    Michael Kerrisk
        Remove words under '.note': "described below"
            The existing text is broken, because there is
            no '"Note Section" format' describe below. Simplest
            solution is to remove the words "described below".

filesystems.5
    Jeff Barry
        Add discussion of ntfs and ext4

proc.5
    Michael Kerrisk
        Simplify description of /proc/sys and /proc/sys/fs
            In the description of these directories, there's no need
            to list all the files and subdirectories that they contain;
            that information is provided by the entries that follow.

udp.7
    Michael Kerrisk
        Add FIONREAD warning.
            Warn that FIONREAD can't distinguish case of a zero-length

            glibc and the kernel.

            (It's an open question whether or not a version of tzfile.5
            should live independently in man-pages. It was added to the
            man-pages set many years ago. For now, I'll follow a
            conservative course that causes least pain to downstream,
            by continuing to maintain a separate copy in man-pages.)

              recent glibc releases
            * Correct errors in feature test macro requirements
            * Add feature test macro requirements to pages where
              the requirements were not previously stated.

            so that readers are pointed to the information that
            feature test macros must be defined before including
            *any* header file.

            Programmers often make the mistake of including a feature test
            macro only after having already included some header files.
            This patch adds some text at opportune places to remind
            programmers to do things the right way.

            See http://sourceware.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=11235

stat.2
    Michael Kerrisk
        Update information on nanosecond timestamp fields

insque.3
    Michael Kerrisk
        Noted prev == NULL bug in glibc 2.4 and earlier
            As noted by Remi Denis-Courmont, glibc nowadays allows
            'prev' to be NULL, as required by POSIX for initializing
            a linear list. But in glibc 2.4 and earlier, 'prev' could
            not be NULL. Add a BUGS section noting this.

            See http://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=551201
    Michael Kerrisk
        Added info on circular lists, and initializing circular lists

New and rewritten pages

        New page documenting the PowerPC-specific subpage_prot(2)

aio_init.3
    Michael Kerrisk
        New page documenting aio_init(3)


Newly documented interfaces in existing pages
---------------------------------------------

posix_fadvise.2
    Michael Kerrisk
        Document the architecture-specific arm_fadvise64_64() system call
            This ARM-specific system call fixes the argument ordering
            for that architecture. Since Linux 2.6.14.

sync_file_range.2
    Michael Kerrisk
        Document the architecture-specific sync_file_range2() system call
            As described in commit edd5cd4a9424f22b0fa08bef5e299d41befd5622,
            the sync_file_range() argument order is broken for some
            architectures (PowerPC, ARM, tile). The remedy was a different
            system call using the right argument order on those architectures.

psignal.3
    Guillem Jover
        Document psiginfo()
            psiginfo() was added to glibc in version 2.10.

Global changes
--------------

Many pages
    Michael Kerrisk
        global fix: s/Unix/UNIX/
            The man pages were rather inconsistent in the use of "Unix"
            versus "UNIX". Let's go with the trademark usage.

Various pages
    Michael Kerrisk
        Global fix: s/pseudo-terminal/pseudoterminal/

grantpt.3, ptsname.3, unlockpt.3, pts.4

Changes to individual pages
---------------------------

inotify_rm_watch.2
    Michael Kerrisk
        SYNOPSIS: fix type of 'wd' argument

posix_fadvise.2
    Michael Kerrisk
        Rewrite VERSIONS, noting that the system call is fadvise64()

    Michael Kerrisk
        Add the PowerPC-specific subpage_prot() system call
        Add sync_file_range2()

truncate.2

        SEE ALSO: Add lio_listio(3)

gai_cancel.3
gai_error.3
gai_suspend.3
    Michael Kerrisk
        Make these into links
            In the previous release, these files were accidentally made copies
            of getaddrinfo_a.3, instead of being made as link files.

getifaddrs.3
    Thomas Jarosch
        Prevent possible NULL pointer access in example program

malloc.3
    Michael Kerrisk
        Emphasize that malloc() and realloc() do not initialize allocated memory

malloc_hook.3
    Ivana Varekova
        Warn that these functions are deprecated

strcpy.3
    Michael Kerrisk
        Formatting fixes in strncpy() example implementation code

    Michael Kerrisk
        Reword NOTES on Linux-specific options

sigevent.7
    Michael Kerrisk
        SEE ALSO: Add aio_read(3), aio_write(3), and lio_listio(3)

unix.7
    Michael Kerrisk
        Document the autobind feature
    Michael Kerrisk
        Fix description of abstract socket names
            As reported by Lennart Poettering:
                The part about "abstract" sockets is misleading as it suggests
                that the sockaddr returned by getsockname() would necessarily
                have the size of sizeof(struct sockaddr), which however is not
                the case: getsockname() returns exactly the sockaddr size that
                was passed in on bind(). In particular, two sockets that are
                bound to the same sockaddr but different sizes are completely
                independent.
            See https://bugzilla.kernel.org/show_bug.cgi?id=19812
    Michael Kerrisk
        Fix description of "pathname" sockets
            As reported by Lennart Poettering:
               The part about "pathname" sockets suggests usage of
               sizeof(sa_family_t) + strlen(sun_path) + 1
               for calculating the sockaddr size. Due to alignment/padding
               this is probably not a good idea. Instead, one should use
               offsetof(struct sockaddr_un, sun_path) + strlen() + 1
               or something like that.
            See https://bugzilla.kernel.org/show_bug.cgi?id=19812

New and rewritten pages
-----------------------

kexec_load.2
    Andi Kleen
        New page documenting kexec_load(2)
    Michael Kerrisk
        Add license
    Michael Kerrisk
        Incorporate fixes from Eric W. Biederman
            Eric noted that a few instances of "virtual" should
            be "physical" and noted:

                There is an expectation that at hand off from sys_kexec that
                virtual and physical addresses will be identity mapped. But
                this isn't the old Alpha booting convention where you have
                a virtual address and then you have to parse the page table
                to figure out where your kernel was actually loaded.
    Michael Kerrisk
        Additions and edits by mtk
            Various wording and layout improvements.
            Fixed the name of a constant: s/KEXEC_ARCH_I386/KEXEC_ARCH_386/.
            Added RETURN VALUE and ERRORS sections.
            Added VERSIONS section
            Note that CONFIG_KEXEC is needed
            Removed details of using syscall; the reader can find them in
            syscall(2).
            Added some details for KEXEC_PRESERVE_CONTEXT.
            Revised the text mentioning the kernel header, since it is
            not yet exported, and it's not certain that it will be.

lio_listio.3
    Michael Kerrisk
        New page documenting lio_listio(3)


Newly documented interfaces in existing pages
---------------------------------------------

reboot.2

    Lucian Adrian Grijincu
        Improve description of CLONE_NEWNET
            CLONE_NEWNET creates a new network namespace from scratch.
            You don't have anything from the old network namespace in
            the new one. Even the loopback device is new.
    Michael Kerrisk
        Document CLONE_SYSVSEM
    Michael Kerrisk
        Document CLONE_NEWUTS
    Michael Kerrisk
        Relocate discussion of CAP_SYS_ADMIN to CLONE_NEWNS section
            And rewrite the EPERM description to be more general in
            preparation for the new flags to be documented.


Global changes
--------------

Various pages
    Michael Kerrisk
        Add reference to feature_test_macros(7)
            Some pages simply list feature test macro requirements in
            the form:

koi8-r.7
    David Prevot
        Fix special character names
            Comparing to koi8-u.7, I noticed some inconsistencies in special
            character names. After checking with the following Unicode related
            pages, please find inline (and gzipped attached, hopefully not
            messing with encoding), a patch in order to make it right, on an
            Unicode point of view.

            http://www.unicode.org/charts/PDF/U2500.pdf
            http://www.unicode.org/charts/PDF/U25A0.pdf
            http://www.unicode.org/charts/PDF/U0080.pdf
            http://www.unicode.org/charts/PDF/U1D400.pdf
    David Prevot
        Fix SEE ALSO reference and letter names
            The koi8-r(7) (Russian Net Character Set) manual page refers
            to iso-8859-7(7) manual page, which is the Latin/Greek one.
            I guess it should refer instead to the iso-8859-5(7)
            (Latin/Cyrillic) one. This is addressed at the end of the patch.

            It has also been spotted that letter names are different in
            this manual page and in the Unicode related page [0], the
            first part of the page address this.

                    0: http://www.unicode.org/charts/PDF/U0400.pdf

man-pages.7
    Michael Kerrisk
        Update example
            The old example used the chmod(2) man page, but the
            feature test macro requirements on that page had changed.
            Update to use an example from a different page (acct(2),
            whose feature test macro requirements are probably unlikely
            to change in the future).

            overlap.)

            See http://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=603144
            In reference of http://lwn.net/Articles/414467/

            But $PWD won't be expanded in single quotes. It should be double
            quotes around the entire argument or some other form.

unix.7
    Michael Kerrisk

err.3
    Seonghun Lim
        Clean up description of error message source
            In the second paragraph of DESCRIPTION section, one of the
            sources of error messages is incorrect: the four functions obtain
            error message only from errno, and "a code" is just relevant
            with errc() and warnc(), which are not present on Linux.
            see http://www.unix.com/man-page/freebsd/3/ERR/ .

            Then, the third paragraph becomes a duplicate.

New and rewritten pages
-----------------------

sendmmsg.2
    Michael Kerrisk  [Stephan Mueller]
        New page for sendmmsg(2)
            Some pieces inspired by an initial attempt by Stephan Mueller.


Newly documented interfaces in existing pages
---------------------------------------------

fallocate.2
    Lucian Adrian Grijincu
        Document FALLOC_FL_PUNCH_HOLE
            FALLOC_FL_PUNCH_HOLE was added in Linux 2.6.38,
            for punching holes in the allocated space in a file.


Changes to individual pages
---------------------------

dup.2
    Michael Kerrisk
        SYNOPSIS: Add "#include <fcntl.h>" for O_* constants

fallocate.2
    Michael Kerrisk
        Substantial restructuring of DESCRIPTION
            The addition of a second class of operation ("hole punching")
            to the man page made it clear that some significant restructuring
            is required. So I substantially reworked the page, including the
            preexisting material on the default "file allocation" operation.
    Michael Kerrisk  [Josef Bacik]
        Add further details for FALLOC_FL_PUNCH_HOLE
    Michael Kerrisk
        ERRORS: Add EPERM error case for FALLOC_FL_PUNCH_HOLE

fork.2
    Michael Kerrisk
        NOTES: Describe clone() call equivalent to fork()

fsync.2
    Christoph Hellwig
        Various improvements
            - explain the situation with disk caches better
            - remove the duplicate fdatasync() explanation in the NOTES
              section
            - remove an incorrect note about fsync() generally requiring two
              writes
            - remove an obsolete ext2 example note
            - fsync() works on any file descriptor (doesn't need to be
              writable); correct the EBADF error code explanation
    Michael Kerrisk  [Guillem Jover]
        Note that some systems require a writable file descriptor
            An edited version of Guillem Jover's comments:
            [While the file descriptor does not need to be writable on Linux]
            that's not a safe portable assumption to make on POSIX in general
            as that behavior is not specified and as such is
            implementation-specific. Some Unix systems do actually fail on
            read-only file descriptors, for example [HP-UX and AIX].

mount.2
    Michael Kerrisk  [Junjiro Okajima]
        Removed erroneous statement about MS_RDONLY and bind mounts

open.2
    Jessica McKellar
        Fix grammar in O_DIRECT description
            Some small grammar fixes to the O_DIRECT description.

pipe.2
    Michael Kerrisk  [Salvo Tomaselli]
        SYNOPSIS: Add "#include <fcntl.h>" for O_* constants
            See http://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=659750

sched_rr_get_interval.2
    Clemens Ladisch
        Update notes on modifying quantum
            Since Linux 2.6.24, it is no longer possible to
            modify the SCHED_RR quantum using setpriority(2).
            (Slight edits to Clemens' patch by mtk.)
    Michael Kerrisk
        Reordered various pieces of text
    Michael Kerrisk
        Reworded text of ESRCH error

send.2
    Michael Kerrisk
        Add mention of sendmmsg(2)

sync.2
    Michael Kerrisk  [Simone Piccardi]
        PROTOTYPE: Fix return type of syncfs()

vfork.2
    Michael Kerrisk  [starlight]
        Clarify what is duplicated in the child
            Add some words to make it clear to the reader that vfork(),
            like fork(), creates duplicates of process attributes
            in the child.
    Michael Kerrisk
        Note clone() flags equivalent to vfork()
    Michael Kerrisk  [starlight, Mike Frysinger]
        Add some notes on reasons why vfork() still exists
    Michael Kerrisk  [starlight]
        Clarify that calling *thread* is suspended during vfork()
    Michael Kerrisk
        CONFORMING TO: Note that POSIX.1-2001 marked vfork() obsolete

gets.3
    Michael Kerrisk
        Document C11 and glibc 2.16 changes affecting gets()

pthread_sigmask.3
    Michael Kerrisk  [Pat Pannuto]
        Fix comment that was inconsistent with code in example program

sem_wait.3
    Walter Harms
        EXAMPLE: Remove extraneous line of output from shell session

wcsnrtombs.3
wcsrtombs.3
wcstombs.3
    Michael Kerrisk
        Fix-ups for e9c23bc636426366d659809bc99cd84661e86464

core.5
    Michael Kerrisk  [Junjiro Okajima]
        Document %E specifier for core_pattern

passwd.5
    Michael Kerrisk  [Walter Haidinger]
        s/asterisk/asterisk (*)/ to improve clarity
    Michael Kerrisk
        Correct note on passwd field value when shadowing is enabled
            When password shadowing is enabled, the password field
            contains an 'x' (not "*').

proc.5
    Elie De Brauwer
        Fix description of fourth field of /proc/loadavg
            SIgned-off-by: Elie De Brauwer <eliedebrauwer@gmail.com>

resolv.conf.5
    Michael Kerrisk  [Slaven Rezic]
        Describe syntax used for comments
            See http://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=656994

feature_test_macros.7
    Michael Kerrisk
        Document _ISOC11_SOURCE

inotify.7
    Michael Kerrisk  [Yang Yang]
        Note that 'cookie' field is set to zero when unused

man.7
    Michael Kerrisk
        Various fixes for description of NAME section
            As noted by reporter:
            * The code sample given for the NAME section is incomplete because
              the actual content sample is not given.
            * Additionally, the description assumes that the item described is
              a command, which need not be the case.
            * The command makewhatis is not present on my system; the
              documented tool to create the whatis database is called mandb.
            * The description on .SH NAME in man(7) should either copy the
              relevant paragraph of lexgrog(1) or refer to it.

New and rewritten pages
-----------------------

getent.1
    Mark R. Bannister
        New page to document 'getent' binary provided by glibc


Changes to individual pages
---------------------------

bdflush.2
    Michael Kerrisk
        Note that bdflush() is deprecated, and does nothing

nfsservctl.2
    Michael Kerrisk
        Note that this system call was removed in Linux 3.1

ptrace.2
    Denys Vlasenko  [Oleg Nesterov, Tejun Heo]
        add extended description of various ptrace quirks
            Changes include:

            s/parent/tracer/g, s/child/tracee/g - ptrace interface now
            is sufficiently cleaned up to not treat tracing process
            as parent.

            Deleted several outright false statements:
            - pid 1 can be traced
            - tracer is not shown as parent in ps output
            - PTRACE_ATTACH is not "the same behavior as if tracee had done
              a PTRACE_TRACEME": PTRACE_ATTACH delivers a SIGSTOP.
            - SIGSTOP _can_ be injected.
            - Removed mentions of SunOS and Solaris as irrelevant.
            - Added a few more known bugs.

            Added a large block of text in DESCRIPTION which doesn't focus
            on mechanical description of each flag and operation, but rather
            tries to describe a bigger picture. The targeted audience is
            a person which is reasonably knowledgeable in Unix but did not
            spend years working with ptrace, and thus may be unaware of its
            quirks. This text went through several iterations of review by
            Oleg Nesterov and Tejun Heo.
            This block of text intentionally uses as little markup as possible,
            otherwise future modifications to it will be very hard to make.
    Michael Kerrisk
        Global clean-up of page
            * Wording and formatting fixes to existing text and
              Denys Vlasenko's new text.
            * Various technical amendments and improvements to
              Denys Vlasenko's new text.
            * Added FIXME for various problems with the current text.

        New man page for malloc_usable_size(3)

    Cyrill Gorcunov
        Document PR_SET_MM (new in Linux 3.3)
    Michael Kerrisk
        Various edits and improvements to Cyrill's patch


Changes to individual pages
---------------------------

epoll_create.2
    Michael Kerrisk
        Rework discussion of 'size' argument
    Michael Kerrisk
        Add .SS for description of epoll_create1()

epoll_wait.2
    Michael Kerrisk  [Armin Rigo]
        Another thread can add to epoll instance while epoll_wait is blocked
            See https://bugzilla.kernel.org/show_bug.cgi?id=43072
    Michael Kerrisk
        Clarify that epoll_pwait() blocks calling *thread*
        A few wording improvements

fchmodat.2
    Michael Kerrisk  [Mike Frysinger]
        Note difference between glibc wrapper and underlying system call
            The wrapper function has a 'flags' argument (which currently
            serves no purpose), while the underlying system call does not.

fcntl.2
    Abhijith Das
        Explain behaviour of F_GETLEASE during lease break
    Michael Kerrisk  [Eric Blake]
        Change type of arg from "long" to "int"
            Various fcntl(2) commands require an integral 'arg'.
            The man page said it must be "long" in all such cases.
            However, for the cases covered by POSIX, there is an
            explicit requirement that these arguments be "int".
            Update the man page to reflect. Probably, all of the
            other "long" cases (not specified in POSIX) should
            be "int", and this patch makes them so. Based on a
            note fromEric Blake, relating to F_DUPFD_CLOEXEC.

gettimeofday.2
    Michael Kerrisk
        Reorganize content
            The main change is to move the historical information about
            the 'tz_dsttime' to NOTES.
    Michael Kerrisk  [Felix]
        Note that compiler issues warnings if 'tv' is NULL

mmap.2
    Michael Kerrisk  [Kevin O'Gorman]
        Clarify that this system call should not be invoked directly
            See https://bugzilla.kernel.org/show_bug.cgi?id=42892
    Michael Kerrisk
        Clarify NOTES discussion of mmap() versus mmap2()

poll.2
    Michael Kerrisk  [Michael Welsh Duggan]
        Document negative value in 'fd' field
    Michael Kerrisk
        Document semantics of passing zero in 'events' field

ptrace.2
    Denys Vlasenko
        Various fixes
            For some reason, the PTRACE_TRACEME paragraph talks about some
            general aspects of ptraced process behavior. It repeats the
            "tracee stops on every signal" information even though that was
            already explained just a few paragraphs before. Then it describes
            legacy SIGTRAP on execve().

            This patch deletes the first part, and moves the second part up,
            into the general ptrace description. It also adds
            "If PTRACE_O_TRACEEXEC option is not in effect" to the description
            of the legacy SIGTRAP on execve().

            The patch also amends the part which says "For requests other
            than PTRACE_KILL, the tracee must be stopped." - PTRACE_ATTACH
            also doesn't require that.

sigaction.2
    Michael Kerrisk  [Andreas Jaeger, ]
        Clarify that the use of SI_SIGIO is for Linux 2.2 only
            See also http://sourceware.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=6745

sigprocmask.2
    Mike Frysinger
        ERRORS: add EFAULT

times.2
    Michael Kerrisk  [Simone Piccardi]
        ERRORS: Add EFAULT

div.3
    Michael Kerrisk  [Reuben Thomas]
        CONFORMING TO: Add C99

fread.3
    Regid Ichira
        Clarify further that return value is number of items, not bytes
            See also http://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=665780

getaddrinfo.3
    Michael Kerrisk  [Jak]
        Correct type of ai_addrlen field

malloc.3
    Michael Kerrisk
        SEE ALSO: add malloc_usable_size(3)
        SEE ALSO: Add malloc_trim(3)

    Michael Kerrisk  [Reuben Thomas]
        Remove mention of terminating null in description of rawmemchr()

perror.3
    Michael Kerrisk  [Jesus Otero]
        Note that use of 'sys_errlist' is deprecated

rcmd.3
    Michael Kerrisk
        glibc eventually added a declaration of iruserok() in version 2.12

sysconf.3
    Michael Kerrisk  [Ricardo Catalinas Jiménez]
        Add mention of _SC_SYMLOOP_MAX

nologin.5
    Michael Kerrisk  [Tetsuo Handa]
        nologin must not only exist, but *be readable* to be effective

nsswitch.conf.5
    Mark R Bannister
        Significant rewrites and improvements
            This patch applies to nsswitch.conf.5 in man-pages-3.36.

            My changes almost completely rewrite large sections of the
            man page. They are needed to add clarity, correct grammar,
            reduce confusion, and bring up-to-date with the latest glibc.
            I have checked the man page against the nss source code in
            glibc 2.14.90.

            Historical notes are demoted to the footer.

            The rewrite makes the man page much clearer to
            understand, more authoratitive, and easier to read.
    Michael Kerrisk
        Light edits to Mark Bannister's changes

capabilities.7
    Michael Kerrisk
        Add prctl(PR_SET_MM) to CAP_SYS_RESOURCE

        Note cases where nonprivileged users can use netlink multicast groups
            See also https://bugzilla.novell.com/show_bug.cgi?id=754611

unix.7
    Michael Kerrisk  [Tetsuo Handa]
        Add a detail on autobind feature

ld.so.8
    Jonathan Nieder  [Reuben Thomas]
        Document effect of hwcaps on search path
            Wording by Aurelien Jarno from Debian glibc's r4701 (2011-06-04).

            for the signal receiver, so remove mention of raise(3)
            here. The user can deduce the details, if needed, by looking
            at the recently updated raise(3) page.

aio_cancel.3
    Michael Kerrisk  [Jon Grant]
        Rewrite RETURN VALUE section to be clearer

aio_init.3
    Michael Kerrisk  [Jon Grant]
        Remove extraneous "POSIX" from NAME section

btree.3
dbopen.3
hash.3
mpool.3
recno.3
    Michael Kerrisk  [Brian M. Carlson]
        Note that glibc no longer provides these interfaces
            glibc stopped providing these interfaces with v2.2.
            Nowadays, the user that finds these pages probably wants
            the libdb API, so note this in the page.

            See http://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=337581

fopen.3
    Michael Kerrisk
        BUGS: Note limitation on number of flag characters parsed in 'mode'
    Michael Kerrisk
        Note that 'c' and 'e' flags are ignored for fdopen()
            Determined from reading libio/iofdopen.c.
    Michael Kerrisk
        Document ",ccs=string" feature of 'mode' for fopen()/freopen()

getgrnam.3
    Michael Kerrisk  [Ulrich Drepper]
        Fix discussion of _SC_GETGR_R_SIZE_MAX
            The value is not meant to be a maximum (as was specified in
            SUSv3) but an initial guess at the required size
            (as specified in SUSv4).

getpwnam.3
    Michael Kerrisk  [Ulrich Drepper]
        Fix discussion of _SC_GETPW_R_SIZE_MAX
            The value is not meant to be a maximum (as was specified in
            SUSv3) but an initial guess at the required size
            (as specified in SUSv4).

malloc.3
mallopt.3
mtrace.3
    Michael Kerrisk
        SEE ALSO: add mcheck(3)

memchr.3
    Michael Kerrisk
        Clarify description, omitting mention of "strings" and "characters"
            The existing text slipped into talking about characters and
            strings, which could mislead readers into thing that, for
            example, searches for the byte '\0' are treated specially.
            Therefore, rewrite in terms of "bytes" and "memory areas".

            At the same time, make a few source file clean-ups.

mkstemp.3
    Michael Kerrisk
        Add "mkstemps" and "mkostemps" to NAME line

posix_openpt.3
    Michael Kerrisk  [Vadim Mikhailov]
        Add some details on use of the slave pathname
            An explicit pointer to ptsname(3) is useful, as is a note
            of the fact that the slave device pathname exists only as
            long as the master device is held open.

raise.3
    Michael Kerrisk
        Add some notes on underlying system call that is used

rcmd.3
    Michael Kerrisk
        Add some details of the rresvport() 'port' argument

resolver.3
    Petr Baudis
        Note that many options are documented in resolv.conf(5)

scandir.3
    Michael Kerrisk  [Daniel J Blueman]
        Improve EXAMPLE source code: s/0/NULL/ in scandir() call

strchr.3
    James Hunt
        Explain behavior when searching for '\0'

strerror.3
    Eric Blake  [Stefan Puiu]
        Improve strerror_r() description
            POSIX requires that perror() not modify the static storage
            returned by strerror().  POSIX 2008 and C99 both require that
            strerror() never return NULL (a strerror() that always
            returns "" for all inputs is valid for C99, but not for POSIX).

            http://sourceware.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=12204
            documents glibc's change to come into compliance with POSIX
            regarding strerror_r() return value.  The GNU strerror_r() use
            of 'buf' was confusing - I ended up writing a test program that
            proves that 'buf' is unused for valid 'errnum', but contains
            truncated "unknown message" for out-of-range 'errnum'.

            See also http://austingroupbugs.net/view.php?id=382
    Bernhard Walle
        Correct description of error return for XSI strerror_r()
    Michael Kerrisk [Eric Blake]
        Note how to use 'errno' to detect errors when calling strerror()
    Michael Kerrisk  [Jon Grant]
        Add an example of the kind of string returned by strerror()

resolv.conf.5
    Petr Baudis
        Document "single-request" option

inotify.7
    Michael Kerrisk
        Note buffer size that guarantees being able to read at least one event
    James Hunt
        Correct description of size of inotify_event structure

iso_8859-1.7
    Eugen Dedu
        Add "-" for SOFT HYPHEN
            See http://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=156154

netdevice.7
    Brian F. G. Bidulock
        Document some SIOC configuration ioctls
            This patch adds common but missing SIOC configuration ioctls to
            the netdevice.7 manual pages that are not documented anywhere
            else. SIOCSIFPFLAGS and SIOCGIFPFLAGS are linux-specific. Flag
            values come from Linux 2.6.25 kernel headers for sockios. The
            others are standard BSD ioctls that have always been implemented
            by Linux and were verified from inspecting netdevice.c kernel
            code.

socket.7
    Michael Kerrisk  [Alexey Toptygin]
        Correct description of SO_BROADCAST

tcp.7
    lepton
        Correct description for TCP_MAXSEG on modern kernel

CIRCLEQ_INSERT_TAIL.3
CIRCLEQ_REMOVE.3
    Michael Kerrisk
        New link to queue.3
            The queue(3) page documents these macros, so it makes sense to
            have links for the names.

DES_FAILED.3
    Michael Kerrisk
        New link to des_crypt.3
            The des_crypt(3) page documents this macro, so it makes sense

    Michael Kerrisk
        New link to qsort.3
            Overlooked to add this link in 3.38, when documentation of

    Michael Kerrisk  [Andries E. Brouwer]
        Clarify that these functions operate on bytes, not (wide) characters
            Change 'character(s)' to 'byte(s)' to make clear that these
            functions operate on bytes, not wide / UTF8 characters.
            (POSIX uses 'byte(s)' similarly, to make this point.)

icmp.7
ipv6.7
packet.7
raw.7
rtnetlink.7
unix.7
x25.7
    Michael Kerrisk
        Remove names of constants from NAME line
            Some of the sockets/network protocol pages included names of
            the corresponding address family constants in the NAME line,
            but this wasn't done consistently across all pages, and probably
            it adds little value in those pages that did do this. So, remove
            these constants from those pages that have them in the NAME
            section.


Changes to individual pages
---------------------------

clock_getres.2
    Michael Kerrisk  [Josh Triplett]
        Expand description of CLOCK_REALTIME
            Make it clear that this clock may be discontinuous, and is
            affected my incremental NTP and clock-adjtime(2) adjustments.

            See http://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=540872

epoll_wait.2
    Michael Kerrisk
        Clarify that 'timeout' is a *minimum* interval
            Make it clear that 'timeout' is a minimum interval; the actual
            interval will be rounded up to the system clock granularity,
            and may overrun because of kernel scheduling delays.

execve.2
    Michael Kerrisk
        Rewording to deemphasize libc5 details

fork.2
    Mike Frysinger
        ERRORS: add ENOSYS

        Add RETURN VALUE and ERRORS sections
    Michael Kerrisk
        Refer reader to NOTES for more info about 'tcache'

io_setup.2
io_submit.2
    Michael Kerrisk
        Rewrite to focus on system call API

            Describe race of direct read and fork for unaligned buffers"
            http://thread.gmane.org/gmane.linux.kernel.mm/77571

poll.2
    Michael Kerrisk
        Clarify that 'timeout' is a *minimum* interval
            Make it clear that 'timeout' is a minimum interval; the actual
            interval will be rounded up to the system clock granularity,
            and may overrun because of kernel scheduling delays.
    Michael Kerrisk
        Clarify discussion of wrapper function emulation
            Clarify that glibc (as well as old libc) provides emulation
            using select(2) on older kernels that don't have a poll()
            system call.
    Michael Kerrisk
        Make the meaning of a zero timeout explicit
            Clarify that timeout==0 causes an immediate return, even if
            no file descriptors are ready.

pread.2
    Michael Kerrisk  [Kasper Dupont]
        BUGS: Note O_APPEND + pwrite() does the wrong thing
            See https://bugzilla.kernel.org/show_bug.cgi?id=43178

recvmmsg.2
    Michael Kerrisk
        Clarify that 'timeout' is a *minimum* interval
            Make it clear that 'timeout' interval will be rounded up to the

            scheduling delays.

select.2
    Michael Kerrisk
        Clarify that 'timeout' is a *minimum* interval
            Make it clear that 'timeout' is a minimum interval; the actual
            interval will be rounded up to the system clock granularity,
            and may overrun because of kernel scheduling delays.
    Michael Kerrisk
        Expand description of the self-pipe trick
    Michael Kerrisk
        Add further details on pselect6() system call that underlies pselect()

semop.2
    Michael Kerrisk
        Clarify that 'timeout' of semtimedop() is a *minimum* interval
            Make it clear that 'timeout' interval will be rounded up to the
            system clock granularity, and may overrun because of kernel
            scheduling delays.

signal.2
    Michael Kerrisk
        Note that 'sig_t' requires _BSD_SOURCE
            Also remove some old Linux libc details

sigwaitinfo.2
    Michael Kerrisk
        Clarify that 'timeout' of sigtimedwait() is a *minimum* interval
            Make it clear that 'timeout' is a minimum interval; the actual
            interval will be rounded up to the system clock granularity,
            and may overrun because of kernel scheduling delays.

stat.2
    Bjarni Ingi Gislason
        Formatting fixes
            From "groff -ww" (or "man --warnings=w ..."):

                warning: around line 442: table wider than line width

            GNU man uses line length of 78.

            Use text blocks.  Two spaces between sentences or better: start
            each sentence in a new line.

syscalls.2
    Bjarni Ingi Gislason
        Formatting fixes
            From "groff -ww ..." (or "man --warnings=w ..."):

                warning: around line 157: table wider than line width

            Have to use text blocks.  Move some text to its correct column.
            Split text to two columns to avoid hyphenation.

dbopen.3
    Michael Kerrisk
        SYNOPSIS: Add header file <fcntl.h>
            Upstreamed from Debian, and consistent with FreeBSD
            dbopen(3) man page.

fmemopen.3
    Michael Kerrisk
        Note details of POSIX.1-2008 specification of 'b' in 'mode'
    Michael Kerrisk  [Rich Felker]
        BUGS: fmemopen() doesn't correctly set file position in some cases
            If 'mode' is append, but 'size' does not cover a null byte
            in 'buf', then fmemopen() incorrectly sets the initial file
            position to -1, rather than the next byte after the end of
            the buffer.

            See http://sourceware.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=13151
    Michael Kerrisk
        BUGS: fmemopen() incorrectly handles size==0 case
            If size is zero, fmemopen() fails, This is surprising behavior,
            and not specified in POSIX.1-2008.

            See http://sourceware.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=11216

            Reported-by; Alex Shinn <alexshinn@gmail.com>
    Michael Kerrisk
        BUGS: Note silent ABI change for fmemopen() in glibc 2.9
    Michael Kerrisk  [Rich Felker]
        BUGS: Append mode does not force writes to append
            Append mode correctly sets the initial offset but does
            not force subsequent writes to append at end of stream.

            See http://sourceware.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=13152
    Michael Kerrisk  [Eric Blake]
        BUGS: Note inconsistent treatment of 'b' in 'mode'
            fopen() permits, for example, both "w+b" and "wb+",
            but only the latter is meaningful to fmemopen().

            See http://sourceware.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=12836

fopencookie.3
    Michael Kerrisk  [Petr Baudis]
        Correct description of return for user-supplied 'write' function

iconv.3
    Michael Kerrisk
        Upstream useful NOTE from Debian
            Warn the reader that the pointer arguments can't be
            interpreted as C style strings. Also, note possible
            alignment requirements for the referenced bytes sequences,
    Michael Kerrisk
        Write a better paragraph introducing iconv() and its arguments

isgreater.3
    Michael Kerrisk  [Vincent Lefevre]
        Clarify that the arguments to these macros must be real-floating
            See http://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=609033

lio_listio.3
    Michael Kerrisk
        Clarify that async notification occurs when *all* I/Os complete

makedev.3
    Michael Kerrisk
        SYNOPSIS: Correct return types of major() and minor()
            See https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=754188

    Michael Kerrisk
        Update CONFORMING TO for POSIX.1-2008
            POSIX.1-2008 doesn't change any details, but make

            Upstreamed from Red Hat / Fedora

resolv.conf.5
    Michael Kerrisk
        Take a Debian improvement into upstream

tzfile.5
    Michael Kerrisk
        Mention timezone directories in DESCRIPTION
            Note that timezone files are usually in /usr/lib/zoneinfo
            or /usr/share/zoneinfo.
    Michael Kerrisk
        Drop SYNOPSIS
            The SYNOPSIS doesn't correspond to a user-visible file.

ascii.7
    Bjarni Ingi Gislason
        Indent for "troff" makes table too wide
            Fix following from "groff -t -ww ...":

                warning: around line 53: table wider than line width

            Extra indent for "troff" makes the table look misplaced
            (default "ps" output).

cp1251.7
    Bjarni Ingi Gislason
        table too wide
            From "nroff -ww -t ...":

                warning: around line 44: table wider than line width

            Columns are made narrower (column gutter decreased).

ipv6.7
    Stefan Puiu
        Add ENODEV error for bind() to link-local IPv6 address

signal.7
    Michael Kerrisk  [Simone Piccardi]
        Clarify that SIGLOST is unused
    Michael Kerrisk
        Comment out crufty BUGS text on SIGLOST
            It must be a very long time since the statement there
            about SIGLOST was true. (The text seems to date back to
            1996.)
    Michael Kerrisk
        Update architectures for tables of signal numbers

utf-8.7
    Brian M. Carlson
        Two clarifications
            This patch clarifies that 0xc0 and 0xc1 are not valid in any UTF-8
            encoding[0], and it also references RFC 3629 instead of RFC 2279.

            [0] In order to have 0xc0, you'd have to have a two-byte encoding
            with all the data bits zero in the first byte (and thus only six
            bits of data), which would be an ASCII character encoded in the
            non-shortest form.  Similarly with 0xc1.

            See http://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=538641

ldconfig.8
nscd.8
    Michael Kerrisk
        Remove path prefix from NAME line
            Command names shown in NAME are normally just the basename,
            not the full pathname of the command.

Global changes
--------------

Various pages
    Sami Kerola
        Global fix: use UR macro where applicable
            The syntax .UR http://example.com paired with .UE will create
            links which one can interact, if the pager allows that.  One
            way to see the effect is ask the man(1) command to use browser
            display, e.g.:

                man -H man7/uri.7

            ("\:" is optional groff syntax to permit hyphenless line breaks.)

        Add note to SYNOPSIS that there is no glibc wrapper for system call
            Reduce the chance that the reader may be misled into thinking
            that there is a wrapper function for this system call by noting
            explicitly in the SYNOPSIS that there is no glibc wrapper and
            pointing the reader to NOTES for further details.

ioprio_set.2
    Colin McCabe
        Clarify the multithreaded behavior of ioprio_set(2)
    Michael Kerrisk  [Марк Коренберг, Kalle Olavi Niemitalo]

            For IOPRIO_WHO_PROCESS, who==0 means operate on the caller.
            For IOPRIO_WHO_PGRP, who==0 means operate on the caller's
            process group.

            See http://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=652443

migrate_pages.2
    Michael Kerrisk  [Christoph Lameter, JoonSoo Kim]
        Fix description of return value

mount.2
    Michael Kerrisk
        For MS_REMOUNT, source is ignored

mprotect.2
    Michael Kerrisk  [Rasmus Villemoes]
        'addr' argument is not const
            As reported by Rasmus:

                Both my system's man-pages (3.22) and the latest online
                (3.41) show:

                    int mprotect(const void *addr, size_t len, int prot);

                as the prototype for mprotect(2). However, POSIX [1] and the
                actual sys/mman.h (on all the systems I checked) do not have
                the const qualifier on the first argument.

msgctl.2
semctl.2
shmctl.2
svipc.7
    Michael Kerrisk
        Don't mention that ipc_perm is defined in <sys/ipc.h>
            There's no need to mention that the 'ipc_perm' structure
            is defined in <sys/ipc.h>. That's an implementation detail,
            and furthermore <sys/ipc.h> is itself included by the other
            System V IPC header files. The current text might lead the
            reader to conclude that they must include <sys/ipc.h>, which
            is not the case (it is required neither on Linux, nor by the
            standards).

msgctl.2
msgget.2
msgop.2
semctl.2
semget.2
semop.2
shmctl.2
shmget.2
    Michael Kerrisk
        NOTES: <sys/types.h> and <sys/ipc.h> aren't strictly needed
            Add text to NOTES to say that the <sys/types.h> and <sys/ipc.h>
            header files aren't required by Linux or the standards, but may
            be needed for portability to old systems.

ptrace.2
    Denys Vlasenko
        Explain WNOHANG behavior and EINTR bug
            I didn't like the "SIGKILL operates similarly, with exceptions"
            phrase (if it's different, then it's not "similar", right?),
            and now I got around to changing it. Now it says simply:
            "SIGKILL does not generate signal-delivery-stop and therefore
            the tracer can't suppress it."

            Replaced "why WNOHANG is not reliable" example with a more
            realistic one (the one which actually inspired to add this
            information to man page in the first place): we got
            ESRCH - process is gone! - but waitpid(WNOHANG) can still
            confusingly return 0 "no processes to wait for".

            Replaced "This means that unneeded trailing arguments may
            be omitted" part with a much better recommendation
            to never do that and to supply zero arguments instead.
            (The part about "undocumentedness" of gcc behavior was bogus,
            btw - deleted).

            Expanded BUGS section with the explanation and an example
            of visible strace behavior on the buggy syscalls which
            exit with EINTR on ptrace attach. I hope this will lead
            to people submitting better bug reports to lkml about
            such syscalls.

seteuid.2
    Michael Kerrisk
        Note glibc version where setegid() implementation changed
            In glibc 2.2/2.3, setegid() switched from setregid() to setresgid().

set_tid_address.2
    Michael Kerrisk
        Rename 'ctid' argument for consistency with clone(2) page
    Michael Kerrisk
        Some rewordings and minor clarifications

sigwaitinfo.2
    Michael Kerrisk  [Daniel Zingaro]
        Some wording clarifications
            Mainly rewording things like "is delivered" to "becomes pending",
            which is more accurate terminology.

syscall.2
    Michael Kerrisk
        Add some more details to the description of syscall(2)
            And add another example of using syscall() to the program example.

syscalls.2
    Michael Kerrisk
        Add kcmp(2)
    Michael Kerrisk
        Move discussion of set_zone_reclaim(2) out of main table
            This system call was never visible to user space, so it makes
            sense to move it out of the main table of system calls into
            the notes below the table.

getifaddrs.3
    Michael Kerrisk  [Adrian Dabrowski]
        Note that ifa_addr and ifa_netmask can be NULL

readdir.3
    Michael Kerrisk  [Jan Engelhardt]
        Handle -1 error from pathconf() in example code snippet
            Improve the example demonstrating allocation of a buffer
            for readdir_r() to handle -1 error return from pathconf().
            Otherwise, naive readers may think that pathconf() return
            value can be used without checking.

realpath.3
    Shawn Landden
        Use past tense with ancient history (libc4, libc5)

regex.3
    Michael Kerrisk
        Correct SEE ALSO reference to glibc manual "regex" section

rtime.3
    Michael Kerrisk  [Jan Engelhardt]
        Fix broken pointer cast in example code

sem_close.3
sem_destroy.3
sem_getvalue.3
sem_init.3
sem_open.3
sem_post.3
sem_unlink.3
sem_wait.3
sem_overview.7
    Michael Kerrisk
        Note that "cc -pthread" is required; "-lrt" no longer works
            See https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/manpages/+bug/874418

sigwait.3
    Michael Kerrisk
        Reword "is delivered" to "becomes pending"

strcat.3
    Michael Kerrisk
        Add some text to emphasize the dangers of buffer overruns
    Michael Kerrisk
        NOTES: Add discussion of strlcat()

strcpy.3
    Michael Kerrisk
        Note that info is lost when strncpy() doesn't null terminate
    Michael Kerrisk
        Add some text to emphasize possibility of buffer runs with strcpy()
    Michael Kerrisk
        NOTES: Add a discussion of strlcpy()
            Inspired by https://lwn.net/Articles/506530/
    Michael Kerrisk
        Fix description of the null-byte padding performed by strncpy()

tsearch.3
    Michael Kerrisk
        NOTES: remove redundant discussion of unorthodox use of term "postorder"
            This point is already covered at greater length in the main
            text of the page (See the piece "More commonly, ...").
    Michael Kerrisk
        Clarify use for first argument to the twalk() 'action' function
            There's a number of details in POSIX that are omitted in
            the current version of this page.
    Michael Kerrisk
        Some wording fixes

core.5
    Michael Kerrisk
        Note effect of madvise(2) MADV_DONTDUMP flag

capabilities.7
    Michael Kerrisk
        Document CAP_BLOCK_SUSPEND

glob.7
    Bjarni Ingi Gislason
        Change 8 bit characters to 7 bit representation
            Fixes rendering errors for accented 'a' characters.
    Michael Kerrisk  [Aaron Peschel]
        Update bash(1) command used to obtain classical globbing behavior
            The man page formerly noted the bash(1) v1 command to do this.

iso_8859-1.7
    Bjarni Ingi Gislason
        Explanation of SOFT HYPHEN and the code for it
            <groff: iso_8859-2.7>:89: warning: can't find special character `shc'

            This is the only "iso_8859-*.7" file that has this (now)
            undefined character.  The code in column four in "iso_8859-1.7" is
            "0x2D" ("HYPHEN, MINUS SIGN" or "HYPHEN-MINUS") instead of "0xAD".
            See Debian bug 156154 (or package "manpages").

            There should be an explanation for this graphic character and the
            code should be 0xAD in iso_8859-1.7 (as in all others), even
            though "[gn]roff" does not display a "HYPHEN" in that position of
            the table.

            The line with "SOFT HYPHEN" gets a footnote and a short
            explanation.

mdoc.7
    Bjarni Ingi Gislason
        Fixing a warning and a table
            Fis warning from "groff -ww ..." (or "man --warnings=w ..."):

                <groff: mdoc.7>:294: warning:
                tab character in unquoted macro argument

            In one table the distance between columns is too small in the
            "ps" output.  (Bug in the groff "doc.tmac" macro?)

mdoc.samples.7
    Bjarni Ingi Gislason
        Fix warnings from [ng]roff, corrections
            From "man -ww ..." (groff -ww ...):

                <standard input>:541: warning:
                tab character in unquoted macro argument
                [+3 similar warnings]
                <standard input>:813: warning: macro `Pu' not defined
                Usage: .Rv -std in sections 2 and 3 only (#1669)
                mdoc warning: A .Bl directive has no matching .El (#1821)

            String "Pu" defined as a row of punctuation characters.
            ".Bl" and ".El" fixed.
            Some arguments, that start with a period or are the name of a
            macro, protected with "\&".
            Variable name for macro ".Rv" corrected.

netdevice.7
    Bjarni Ingi Gislason
        Line in table too long
            Fix warning from "man ..." ("nroff -ww ..."):

                nroff: netdevice.7: warning: around line 98:
                table wider than line width

            Fix: No right adjustment in text blocks in tables.

            See http://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=673873

netlink.7
    Bjarni Ingi Gislason
        Line in table is too long
            Fix warning from "man ..." ("nroff -ww ..."):

                nroff: netlink.7: warning: around line 195:
                table wider than line width

            Horizontal line incorporated into table.
            No right adjustment of text blocks in tables.

            See http://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=673875
    Simon Paillard  [Herbert Xu]
        Change description of "*_pid" fields to "Port ID"
            As reported by Herbert Xu, these should not be considered as PIDs.

            See http://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=383296

rtnetlink.7
    Bjarni Ingi Gislason
        Line in table too long
            Fix warning from "man ..." ("nroff -ww ..."):

                nroff: rtnetlink.7: warning: around line 415:
                table wider than line width

            Column gutter reduced to fit line length.
            Right adjustment in text blocks removed in tables.
            Some header made centered in tables.
            One table put on same page.

            See http://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=674051

socket.7
    Martin H
        Document SO_MARK socket option
            Commit 4a19ec5800fc3bb64e2d87c4d9fdd9e636086fe0 in Jan 2008 added
            the new SO_MARK socket option.

            This patch is based on text from the commit message.

            See https://bugzilla.kernel.org/show_bug.cgi?id=16461.

svipc.7
    Michael Kerrisk
        SYNOPSIS: Remove include of <sys/types.h> and <sys/ipc.h>
            Including <sys/types.h> and <sys/ipc.h> isn't needed on Linux
            and isn't really relevant for the explanation on this page.

epoll_wait.2
    Michael Kerrisk  [Fredrik Arnerup]
        Describe timeout limitation in kernels < 2.6.37
            As reported by Fredrik (and as far as I can tell the problem
            went back to 2.6.0):

            The timeout argument has an upper limit. Any values above that
            limit are treated the same as -1, i.e. to wait indefinitely.
            The limit is given by:

                #define EP_MAX_MSTIMEO min(1000ULL * MAX_SCHEDULE_TIMEOUT / HZ, \
                (LONG_MAX - 999ULL) / HZ)

            That is, the limit depends on the size of a long and the timer
            frequency.  Assuming the long is never smaller than 32 bits
            and HZ never larger than 1000, the worst case is 35 minutes.
            I think this should be mentioned under "BUGS".

            Although this is likely to be fixed in the future
            (http://lkml.org/lkml/2010/8/8/144), the problem exists in
            at least 2.6.14 - 2.6.35. I don't know if select(2) and poll(2)
            are affected.

            https://bugzilla.kernel.org/show_bug.cgi?id=20762
    Michael Kerrisk
        Add pointer to select(2) for discussion of close in another thread

getitimer.2
    Michael Kerrisk  [Trevor Woerner]
        Note Linux's odd handling of the new_value==NULL case
    Michael Kerrisk  [Trevor Woerner]
        Fix types used to declare fields in timeval struct

keyctl.2
    David Prévot
        Reorder SEE ALSO, without .br

poll.2
    Michael Kerrisk
        Add pointer to select(2) for discussion of close in another thread

select.2
    Michael Kerrisk  [Stephane Fillod]
        Note behavior if monitored file descriptor is closed in another thread
            Executive summary: a sane application can't rely on any
            particular behavior if another thread closes a file descriptor
            being monitored by select().

            See https://bugzilla.kernel.org/show_bug.cgi?id=40852
    Michael Kerrisk
        Clarify equivalent pselect() code in terms of threads
            s/sigprogmask/pthread_sigmask/

semop.2
    Michael Kerrisk
        Recast discussion of blocking behavior in terms of threads
            semop() blocks the calling thread, not the process.
    Michael Kerrisk
        SEE ALSO: Add clone(2)
            Give reader a clue about CLONE_SYSVSEM.

shutdown.2
    Michael Kerrisk  [Eric Dumazet]
        Document EINVAL error (and associated bug)
            Eric Dumazet noted that EINVAL was not documented. Some further
            digging shows that it's also not diagnosed consistently.
            See https://bugzilla.kernel.org/show_bug.cgi?id=47111.

sigaction.2
    Michael Kerrisk
        Tweak SA_RESETHAND description

timer_settime.2
    Michael Kerrisk
        Small rewording around discussion of pointer arguments

wait4.2
    Adrian Bunk
        Note that these functions are nonstandard and recommend alternatives
            Some edits to Adrian's patch by mtk.
    Michael Kerrisk
        CONFORMING TO: Note SUS details for wait3()

gnu_get_libc_version.3
    Michael Kerrisk
        Remove unneeded "#define _GNU_SOURCE" from SYNOPSIS

pthread_kill.3
pthread_sigqueue.3
    Michael Kerrisk
        Remove wording "another"
            Writing "another thread" in these pages implies that these
            functions can't be used to send a signal to the calling thread
            itself, which is of course untrue.

sigvec.3
    Michael Kerrisk
        Add "int" arg to sv_handler definition in sigvec structure
    Michael Kerrisk
        Fix small error in discussion of blocking of signals
            The signal that causes the handler to be invoked is blocked,
            but saying "by default" implies that this can be changed via
            the API. It cannot. (One needs sigaction(2) for that.)

syslog.3
    Simon Josefsson
        Remove (apparently bogus) text claiming LOG_AUTH is deprecated
            LOG_AUTH is in POSIX, and widely available. There
            seems to be no basis to the claim it is deprecated.

            Quoting Simon:
                I cannot find any other source that claim LOG_AUTH is
                deprecated in any way.  LOG_AUTH is distinct from
                LOG_AUTHPRIV.  The GNU C Library manual only documents
                LOG_AUTH.  The header files contains both without any
                comment.  Common systems like Debian appear to refer to
                both auth and authpriv facilities in syslog configurations.
                Popular daemons appear to use both facilities.
                Both facilities are discussed in several RFCs.

            See https://bugzilla.kernel.org/show_bug.cgi?id=46091

ttyname.3
    Michael Kerrisk
        SEE ALSO: Add ctermid(3)

proc.5
    Michael Kerrisk
        Clarify header file related to 'flags' field of /proc/PID/stat
    Michael Kerrisk  [Frédéric Brière]
        Update description of 'starttime' field of /proc/PID/stat
            The unit of measurement changed from jiffies to clock ticks in
            Linux 2.6.

            See http://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=675891

ld.so.8
    Michael Kerrisk
        Describe interpretation of slashes in dependency strings
    Michael Kerrisk
        Repeat note that LD_LIBRARY_PATH is ignored in privileged programs
            This point is already noted when discussing search order for
            libraries, but it's worth repeating under the specific discussion
            of LD_LIBRARY_PATH further down the page.
    Michael Kerrisk
        Add some details for LD_PRELOAD
        Note that LD_PRELOAD list separator can be space or colon

New and rewritten pages
-----------------------

delete_module.2
    Michael Kerrisk
        Rewrite to Linux 2.6+ reality
    Michael Kerrisk
        Change license and copyright
            There is now nothing left of the original FSF-copyrighted
            page. So, change the copyright and license.
    Michael Kerrisk  [Lucas De Marchi, Rusty Russell]
        Substantial reorganization after comments from Rusty Russell
            Rusty notes that O_NONBLOCK is almost always used in
            practice. Therefore, it would be better to reorganize
            the page to consider that "the default".

init_module.2
    Michael Kerrisk
        Rewrite to Linux 2.6+ reality
    Michael Kerrisk
        Change copyright and license
            Little of the original page now remains. Change
            copyright and license
    Michael Kerrisk  [Rusty Russell]
        Changes after review comments from Rusty Russell
    Kees Cook

getauxval.3
    Michael Kerrisk
        Document getauxval() function added in glibc 2.16


Global changes
--------------

Various pages
    Michael Kerrisk
        Global fix: Use consistent capitalization in NAME section
            The line(s) in the NAME section should only use capitals
            where English usage dictates that. Otherwise, use
            lowercase throughout.

Various pages
    Michael Kerrisk
        Global fix: "userspace" ==> "user space" or "user-space"
            Existing pages variously use "userspace or "user space".
            But, "userspace" is not quite an English word.
            So change "userspace" to "user space" or, when used
            attributively, "user-space".

            Info mostly taken from Documentation/filesystems/proc.txt
            and Documentation/vm/hugetlbpage.txt.
    Michael Kerrisk
        Default for /proc/sys/fs/protected_{hardlinks,symlinks} is now 0
            The default setting of 1 in/proc/sys/fs/protected_hardlinks
            and /proc/sys/fs/protected_symlinks caused one too many
            breakages for Linus's taste, so commit 561ec64ae67e changed
            the default for both files to 0.
        Note system call error yielded by /proc/sys/fs/protected_symlinks
            Note that violating 'protected_symlinks' restrictions
            causes system calls to fail with the error EACCES.

Changes to individual pages
---------------------------

clone.2
    Michael Kerrisk
        Since 2.6.30, CLONE_NEWIPC also supports POSIX message queues

delete_module.2
    Michael Kerrisk
        Small rewording of description of effect of O_TRUNC

getrlimit.2
    Michael Kerrisk  [Trevor Woerner]
        Document Linux's nonstandard treatment or RLIMIT_CPU soft limit
            Upon encountering the RLIMIT_CPU soft limit when a SIGXCPU handler
            has been installed, Linux invokes the signal handler *and* raises
            the soft limit by one second. This behavior repeats until the
            limit is encountered.  No other implementation that I tested
            (Solaris 10, FreeBSD 9.0, OpenBSD 5.0) does this, and it seems
            unlikely to be POSIX-conformant. The (Linux-specific)
            RLIMIT_RTTIME soft limit exhibits similar behavior.
    Michael Kerrisk
        Point reader at discussion of /proc/[pid]/limits in proc(5)

io_getevents.2
    Michael Kerrisk
        io_getevents() may cause segfault when called with invalid ctx_id
            For reference see: http://marc.info/?l=linux-aio&m=130089887002435&w=2

recv.2
    Michael Kerrisk  [Eric Dumazet]
        UNIX domain sockets support MSG_TRUNC since 3.4

sendmmsg.2
    Elie De Brauwer
        Add example program for sendmmsg()

stat.2
    Simon Paillard
        Clarify description of EOVERFLOW error
            The EOVERFLOW error is not only for st_size, but also
            inode and block size fields. See glibc source file
            sysdeps/unix/sysv/linux/xstatconv.c and kernel source
            file fs/stat.c. Also, fix bit/byte confusion
            See http://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=604928

syscalls.2
    Michael Kerrisk
        Update various references to "i386" to "x86"

            more readable.
    Michael Kerrisk
        Add kernel symbolic 'type' names
    Michael Kerrisk
        Clarify SYSLOG_ACTION_SIZE_UNREAD semantics
            SYSLOG_ACTION_SIZE_UNREAD returns the number of bytes
            available for reading via SYSLOG_ACTION_READ.
    Michael Kerrisk
        Clarify where SYSLOG_ACTION_READ_ALL places data it reads
    Michael Kerrisk
        Clarify semantics of SYSLOG_ACTION_CLEAR
            The SYSLOG_ACTION_CLEAR command (5) does not really clear
            the ring buffer; rather it affects the semantics of what
            is returned by commands 3 (SYSLOG_ACTION_READ_ALL) and
            4 (SYSLOG_ACTION_READ_CLEAR).
    Michael Kerrisk
        Clarify discussion of privileges for commands 3 and 10
    Michael Kerrisk
        Add mention of CONFIG_LOG_BUF_SHIFT

wait.2
    Michael Kerrisk

            See http://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=526778

memcmp.3
    Michael Kerrisk  [Jon Grant]
        Enhance RETURN VALUE text and remove redundant text from DESCRIPTION
            Note that sign of result equals sign of difference between
            first two bytes that differ (treated as "unsigned char")."

mkstemp.3
    Michael Kerrisk  [Florian Weimer]
        Deemphasize discussion of mode 066 in glibc 2.0.6
            Glibc 2.0.6 is now so ld that the discussion of details
            of that version can be deemphasized placing just under
            NOTES.

            See https://bugzilla.kernel.org/show_bug.cgi?id=51811

strcmp.3
    Michael Kerrisk  [Jon Grant]
        Enhance RETURN VALUE text and remove redundant text from DESCRIPTION
            Note that sign of result equals sign of difference between
            first two bytes that differ (treated as "unsigned char")."

ttyname.3
    Michael Kerrisk
        Fix confused text in ERRORS
            The existing text suggested that the ERRORS applied
            only for ttyname_r(). However, 2 of the 3 errors
            can occur for ttyname().

undocumented.3
    Michael Kerrisk

    Gao Feng
        Add description of getsockopt() for IPV6_MTU
            In IPv4,IP_MTU is only supported by getsockopt.
            In IPv6, we can use IPV6_MTU to set socket's MTU,
            but the return value of getsockopt() is the path MTU.

rtnetlink.7
    Michael Kerrisk  [Julien Cristau]
        Update description of IFLA_STATS to Linux 2.6+ reality
            See http://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=526778

socket.7
    Michael Kerrisk  [YOSHIFUJI Hideaki]
        Document 'sockaddr' and 'sockaddr_storage' types
    Andi Kleen
        Explain effect of SO_SNDTIMEO for connect()
            When SO_SNDTIMEO is set before connect(), then connect()
            may return EWOULDBLOCK when the timeout fires.

Changes to individual pages
---------------------------

clone.2
    Michael Kerrisk
        Add kernel versions for various CLONE_* constants
    Michael Kerrisk
        CLONE_NEWIPC governs mechanisms that don't have filesystem pathnames
    Michael Kerrisk
        CLONE_NEWIPC doesn't mount the POSIX MQ file system
    Michael Kerrisk
        Add an example program (CLONE_NEWUTS)
    Michael Kerrisk
        Some reworking of CLONE_NEWIPC text
            No substantial content changes.
    Michael Kerrisk
        SEE ALSO: add kcmp(2)
        SEE ALSO: add setns(2)

fallocate.2
    Michael Kerrisk
        FALLOC_FL_* flags are defined in glibc only since 2.18

getxattr.2
removexattr.2
setxattr.2
    Michael Kerrisk  [Andrew Perepechko, ]
        Note that ENOATTR is a synonym for ENODATA
            Various people have pointed out that strace(1) shows ENODATA
            for the case where the named attribute does not exist, or
            the process has no access to this attribute. ENODATA
            and ENOATTR are in fact defined as synonyms. Point this out
            in the man page, so that people understand the strace(1) info.

            See https://bugzilla.kernel.org/show_bug.cgi?id=51871

getxattr.2
listxattr.2
removexattr.2
setxattr.2
    Michael Kerrisk
        Put errors under ERRORS section
            The errno values on these pages were listed in a nonstandard
            way under the RETURN VALUE section. Put them in ERRORS sections.

init_module.2
    Michael Kerrisk  [Rusty Russell]
        ERRORS: Add errors for module signatures (EBADMSG, ENOKEY)

link.2
mkdir.2
mknod.2
open.2
rename.2
symlink.2
write.2
mkfifo.3
    Mark Hills
        Document EDQUOT error
            The return error EDQUOT is not documented in open(2), write(2),
            symlink(2) etc.

            Whether inodes or disk blocks are required for each function
            is something I based on received wisdom and BSD documentation,
            rather than tracing the code to the kernel. For symlink(2)
            this certainly depends on the file system type.

listxattr.2
    Michael Kerrisk  [Theodore Ts'o]
        Fix RETURN VALUE description
            On success, 0 may be returned, so change wording from
            "positive number" to "nonnegative number".

outb.2
    Michael Kerrisk
        Add SYNOPSIS

prctl.2
    Kees Cook
        Document PR_SET_PTRACER
            Document the Yama LSM's prctl handler that allows processes to
            declare ptrace restriction exception relationships via
            PR_SET_PTRACER.
    Michael Kerrisk
        Make it explicit that PR_SET_PTRACER replaces previous setting
            The attribute is a scalar, not a list.
    Shawn Landden
        Document EINVAL error for PR_SET_PTRACER
    Michael Kerrisk
        Document PR_GET_TID_ADDRESS

ptrace.2
    Michael Kerrisk
        Document PTRACE_O_EXITKILL
    Michael Kerrisk
        Place PTRACE_SETOPTIONS list in alphabetical order

query_module.2
    Michael Kerrisk
        Must be called using syscall(2)
            Yes, the call is way obsolete, but add this info
            for completeness.

recvmmsg.2
    Elie De Brauwer
        Add/correct kernel version info for recvmmsg() and MSG_WAITFORNONE
            This patch isolates the since/version related fixes as requested.
            This change introduces the following delta:
             * The page states it was added in 2.6.32 but it is only added
                2.6.33 (ref: http://kernelnewbies.org/Linux_2_6_33)
             * The MSG_WAITFORONE flag was in turn only added in 2.6.34

    Michael Kerrisk
        Add finit_module(2)

sysctl.2
    Michael Kerrisk  [Garrett Cooper]
        ERRORS: EACCES as a synonym for EPRM

        Remove crufty text about 'time_t' on "other systems"
            Back in 2006, some text came in via Debian patches that seems
            crufty. Remove it.

    Michael Kerrisk

core.5
proc.5
    Kees Cook
        Clarify suid_dumpable versus core_pattern
            In Linux 3.6, additional requirements were placed on core_pattern
            when suid_dumpable is set to 2. Document this and include commit
            references.
    Justin Lebar
        statm's "shared" field refers to pages backed by files
            I noticed that statm's "shared" field doesn't match the sum of
            all the "shared" entries in smaps [1].

            The kernel docs explain that statm's "shared" field is "number of
            pages that are shared (i.e. backed by a file)" [2].  smaps appears
            to call a page shared if it's mapped by at least two processes,
            which explains this discrepancy.

            I'm not a kernel hacker, but it appears to me they do mean "i.e."
            and not "e.g." in the statm description: In
            fs/proc/task_mmu.c::task_statm, I see

                *shared = get_mm_counter(mm, MM_FILEPAGES);

            Here's a patch which updates the man page to match the (hopefully
            correct) kernel docs.

        SEE ALSO: add fallocate(1)

regex.3
    Reuben Thomas
        Clarify details of matching
            The first is that it's far from clear that the end points of the
            complete string match are stored in the zero'th element of the
            regmatch_t array; secondly, the phrase "next largest substring
            match" is positively misleading, implying some sort of size
            ordering, whereas in fact they are ordered according to their
            appearance in the regex pattern.

        Clarify meaning of "string conversions" for 'm' modifier
    Mike Frysinger

Global changes
--------------

Many pages
    Michael Kerrisk
        Global fix: remove unneeded double quotes in .SH headings

Many pages
    Michael Kerrisk
        Global fix: remove unneeded double quotes in .SS headings

Many pages
    Michael Kerrisk
        Global fix: use consistent capitalization in .SS headings
            Capitalization in .SS sections across pages (and sometimes even
            within a single page) is wildly inconsistent. Make it consistent.
            Capitalize first word in heading, but otherwise use lower case,
            except where English usage (e.g., proper nouns) or programming
            language requirements (e.g., identifier names) dictate otherwise.

Many pages
    Michael Kerrisk  [Denys Vlasenko]
        Remove double blank lines in output

Various pages
    Michael Kerrisk
        Fix order of SH sections


Changes to individual pages
---------------------------

accept.2
    Michael Kerrisk
        NAME: Add "accept4"

access.2
    Colin Walters
        Note that access() may also fail for FUSE
            Since in some cases (e.g. libguestfs's guestmount) it also has the
            semantics where files can appear owned by root, but are actually
            mutable by the user, despite what one might infer from the Unix
            permissions.

getpeername.2
    Michael Kerrisk  [Kai Kunschke]
        Clarify semantics of getpeername() for datagram sockets
            See http://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=674034

getuid.2
    Michael Kerrisk
        Remove duplicate section heading

mmap.2
    Cyril Hrubis
        Add note about partial page in BUGS section
            This adds a note about Linux behavior with partial page at the end
            of the object. The problem here is that a page that contains only
            part of a file (because the file size is not multiple of PAGE_SIZE)
            stays in page cache even after the mapping is unmapped and the file
            is closed. So if some process dirties such page, other mappings
            will see the changes rather than zeroes.
    Michael Kerrisk  [Török Edwin]
        Some 'flags' values require a feature test macro to be defined
            Add text to NOTES noting that some MAP_* constants are
            defined only if a suitable feature test macro is defined.
            See http://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=542601
    Cyril Hrubis
        Document EOVERFLOW error

open.2
    Michael Kerrisk
        Clarify list of file creation flags
            POSIX.1-2008 TC1 clarified this, so that O_CLOEXEC,
            O_DIRECTORY, and O_NOFOLLOW are also in this list.

prctl.2
    Cyrill Gorcunov
        Add some details for PR_GET_TID_ADDRESS

read.2
    Michael Kerrisk  [Zack Weinberg]
        Clarify interaction of count==0 and error checking
            POSIX deliberately leaves this case open, so the man
            page should be less specific about what happens.

            See http://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=533232
    Michael Kerrisk  [Marc Lehmann]
        Remove crufty text about O_NONBLOCK on files
            See http://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=700529
    Michael Kerrisk
        Clarify details for seekable files

unimplemented.2
    Michael Kerrisk  [Peter Schiffer]
        Add various STREAMS interfaces to NAME
            Taken from Red Hat downstream.

            See https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=436407

cexp2.3
    Michael Kerrisk
        Still does not exist in glibc 2.17

exit.3
    Michael Kerrisk
        Note that a call to execve() clears exit handler registrations

getaddrinfo.3
    Michael Kerrisk
        SEE ALSO: Add gai.conf(5)

malloc_trim.3
    Michael Kerrisk
        Remove duplicate section title

printf.3
    Marshel Abraham  [Graham Gower, Graham Gower]
        Fix error handling in example code
            See https://bugzilla.kernel.org/show_bug.cgi?id=23282

pthread_yield.3
    Michael Kerrisk  [Aristeu Rozanski]
        Add _GNU_SOURCE feature test macro to SYNOPSIS

resolver.3
resolv.conf.5
    Michael Kerrisk  [Nathan Stratton Treadway, Simon Heimberg]
        RES_DEBUG is only available if glibc is compiled with debug support
            See http://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=692136
            and https://bugzilla.kernel.org/show_bug.cgi?id=43061

strtol.3
    Michael Kerrisk  [Peter Schiffer]
        Remove crufty text from previous fix

core.5
    Michael Kerrisk
        Document CONFIG_COREDUMP

capabilities.7
    Andrey Vagin
        Nonexistent bits are no longer shown as set in /proc/PID/status Cap*

inotify.7
    Michael Kerrisk
        A monitoring process can't easily distinguish events triggered by itself

ip.7
    Flavio Leitner  [Peter Schiffer]
        Improve explanation about calling listen() or connect()

man-pages.7
    Michael Kerrisk
        Describe rules for capitalization in .SS headings

rtnetlink.7
    Pavel Emelyanov
        Add info about ability to create links with given index
            Since kernel v3.7 the RTM_NEWLINK message now accepts nonzero
            values in ifi_index field. Mention this fact in the respective
            rtnetlink.7 section.

socket.7
    Pavel Emelyanov
        SO_BINDTODEVICE is now readable
            SO_BINDTODEVICE is readable since kernel 3.8.

in the changelog below) reports, notes, and ideas that have been
incorporated in changes in this release:

Michael Kerrisk <mtk.manpages@gmail.com>


Global changes
--------------

The goal of the changes below to consistently format copyright
and license information in the comments in the page source
at the top of each page. This allows for easy scripting to
extract that information. Following these changes the comments
the top of the page source should now consistently have the form:

    .\" <copyright info, possibly spread over several lines>
    .\"
    .\" %%%LICENSE_START(<license-type>)
    .\" <license text>
    .\" %%%LICENSE_END
    .\" <other comments>

Note that the 'license-type' is merely descriptive.  Its purpose is
to simplify scripting for the purpose of gathering statistics on
types of licenses used in man-pages.  It is NOT a statement about
the actual licensing of the page; that license is contain INSIDE the
LICENSE_START...LICENSE_END clause.

All pages
    Michael Kerrisk
        Add a LICENSE_START()...LICENSE_END clause in source at
        top of each page that encapsulates the license text.
    Michael Kerrisk
        Put copyright info at top of page, followed by blank line and LICENSE

Various pages
    Michael Kerrisk
         Update info in source comments on where to get a copy of the GPL

Various pages
    Michael Kerrisk
        Remove "Hey Emacs" comment in page source
            Only certain pages have this; there is no consistency, so
            remove it from all pages
    Michael Kerrisk
        Remove "-*- nroff -*-" comment at top of source

            See http://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=643854

random.4
    Elie De Brauwer
        Document write and document the ioctl interface of /dev/random
            The update consists out of two parts:
             - a minor thing which just documents what happens if a write to
               /dev/(u)random is performed, which is used in the example
               script but not explicitly mentioned.
             - the other (biggest) part is the documentation of the ioctl()
               interface which /dev/(u)random exposes. This ioctl() lives in
               drivers/char/random.c and the primitives can be found in
               include/linux/random.h

            One comment remains, there used to be an RNDGETPOOL ioctl() which
            disappeared in v2.6.9. I found two patches on the net:
            - http://www.kernel.org/pub/linux/kernel/people/akpm/patches/2.6/2.6.8.1/2.6.8.1-mm4/broken-out/dev-random-remove-rndgetpool-ioctl.patch
            - https://lkml.org/lkml/2004/3/25/168

            But as far as I can tell the first one got applied but the 2nd
            one seems more correct. The result is that even today one can
            still find traces of the RNDGETPOOL ioctl() in the header files.
            Is this there for historical reasons or because it might break
            userspace, even though using it will just give an EINVAL.

bootparam.7
    Jose Luis Domingo Lopez
        Document 'rootfstype' option
            See http://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=182014

        Add various pieces under CAP_SYS_RAWIO
            Info obtained by grepping the kernel source.
    Michael Kerrisk
        Add CAP_SYS_RESOURCE /proc/PID/oom_score_adj case

            This directory was added in Linux v3.3 and provides info about
            files being mmap-ed in a way very similar to how /proc/[pid]/fd
            works.

            v2: Added examples of how links look like and noted dependency
            on kernel config option CONFIG_CHECKPOINT_RESTORE.
    Michael Kerrisk
        Document /proc/sys/kernel/shm_rmid_forced

Various System V IPC pages in Section 2
    Michael Kerrisk
        Add "System V" to .TH line and text
            Make it clear that these pages relate to System V IPC,
            not POSIX IPC.


Changes to individual pages
---------------------------

access.2
    Michael Kerrisk  [The Wanderer]
        Clarify RETURN VALUE for F_OK
            See http://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=705293

alarm.2
    Michael Kerrisk
        Correct the description of behavior when 'seconds' is 0

clone.2
    Michael Kerrisk  [Peter Schiffer]
        Add prototype for syscall to SYNOPSIS
            And further clarify the distinction between the system call
            and the wrapper function in the introductory text.
    Michael Kerrisk
        Update feature test macro requirements
            The requirements quietly changed in glibc 2.14

            See also http://www.sourceware.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=4749
    Michael Kerrisk  [Mike Frysinger]
        Clarify differences between clone2() syscall and wrapper function
    Michael Kerrisk  [Mike Frysinger]
        Note those architectures where the sys_clone argument order differs
    Michael Kerrisk  [Mike Frysinger]
        Add short subsection noting that blackfin, m68k, and sparc are different
    Michael Kerrisk
        Move clone2() text to subsection in description
            The description of ia64 clone2() should follow the discussion
            of the raw system call interface.
    Michael Kerrisk
        Change subhead for ia64 discussion

getcpu.2
    Michael Kerrisk
        Recommend that 'tcache' should be specified as NULL nowadays

io_cancel.2
    Jeff Moyer, Michael Kerrisk  [Cyril Hrubis]
        Improve description

io_destroy.2
    Jeff Moyer
        Improve description
            The description was rather vague, citing a "list of I/O contexts"
            and stating that it "can" cancel outstanding requests.  This
            update makes things more concrete so that the reader knows exactly
            what's going on.

io_getevents.2
    Jeff Moyer
        The 'timeout' argument is not updated
            I looked back through the kernel code, and the timeout was
            never updated in any case.  I've submitted a patch upstream
            to change the comment above io_getevents.

io_setup.2
    Jeff Moyer
        Clarify nr_events
            nr_events is technically the number of completion events that can
            be stored in the completion ring.  The wording of the man page:
            "capable of receiving at least nr_events" seems dubious to me,
            only because I worry that folks might interpret that to mean
            'nr_events' total, instead of 'nr_events' concurrently.

            Further, I've added information on where to find the per-user
            limit on 'nr_events', /proc/sys/fs/aio-max-nr.  Let me know if
            you think that is not relevant.

        Add pointers to relevant /proc files described in proc(5)

posix_fadvise.2
pread.2
readahead.2
sync_file_range.2
truncate.2
    Michael Kerrisk
        Refer to syscall(2) for ABI semantics on certain 32-bit architectures
            Also: in sync_file_range.2 and posix_fadvise.2 remove description
            of conventional calling signature as flawed, and in
            posix_fadvise.2, de-emphasize focus on ARM, and rather phrase
            as a more general discussion of certain architectures.

readdir.2
    Michael Kerrisk
        readdir(2) doesn't exist on x86-64

semop.2
    Michael Kerrisk
        Clarify the discussion of 'semadj'

shmctl.2
    Michael Kerrisk
        Refer to proc(5) for description of /proc/sys/kernel/shm_rmid_forced

syscall.2
    Changhee Han
        Add notes that caution users when passing arguments to syscall()
            For example, passing 'long long' on ARM-32 requires special
            treatment.

        Document the exact calling convention for architecture system calls
    Mike Frysinger  [Kyle McMartin]
        Add PA-RISC details under calling conventions

umask.2
    Michael Kerrisk
        SEE ALSO: add acl(5)

unshare.2
    Michael Kerrisk
        Update feature test macro requirements
            The requirements quietly changed in glibc 2.14

            See also http://www.sourceware.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=4749

fopencookie.3
    Michael Kerrisk  [Ralph Loader]
        Correct definition of cookie_io_functions_t

pthread_setname_np.3
    Andrew Clayton
        The thread argument is passed in by value

readir.3
seekdir.3
telldir.3
    Michael Kerrisk
        Eliminate the implication that these functions deal with "offsets"
            The directory position dealt with by the readdir() and
            friends is not a simple file offset in modern file systems.
            Typically, it is some kind of cookie value. Add text and
            make other changes to these pages to eliminate the
            implication that this is an offset, and warn the reader
            that directory positions should be treated strictly as
            opaque values.

            In the process, rename the 'offset' argument of seekdir(3)
            to 'loc', and add some text to readdir(3) to note that
            the 'd_off' field is the same value returned by telldir(3)
            at the current directory position.

        Update feature test macro requirements
            The requirements quietly changed in glibc 2.14

            See also http://www.sourceware.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=4749

ualarm.3
    Michael Kerrisk  [Nicolas Hillegeer]
        Add note on the behavior when 'usecs' is zero
            POSIX.1-2001 does not specify the behavior in this case
            and no other system that I checked documented the behavior.
            Probably, most or all systems do what Linux does in this
            case: cancel any pending alarm, just as alarm(0) does.
            Add that info in NOTES.

elf.5
    Mike Frysinger
        Add byte positions for all EI_xxx fields
            When describing e_ident, most of the EI_xxx defines mention the
            exact byte number.  This is useful when manually hacking an ELF
            with a hex editor.  However, the last few fields don't do this,
            which means you have to count things up yourself.
            Add a single word to each so you don't have to do that.

proc.5
    Michael Kerrisk
        Refer to sched_rr_get_interval(2) for info on sched_rr_timeslice_ms
            Since Linux 3.9, /proc/sys/kernel/sched_rr_timeslice_ms can
            be used to change the SCHED_RR quantum.

    Krzysztof Konopko
        Simplify the example of printing out environ
            The binutils package contains a very handy utility to
            print out null-byte delimited strings from a file.  This
            can replace a rather complex expression with cat(1)
            provided as an example for printing out /proc/[pid]/environ.
    Michael Kerrisk
        Update /proc/PID/maps example
            Update to 64-bit example that includes "[heap]", "[stack],
            and "[vdso]"
    Michael Kerrisk
        Formatting fixes for /proc/PID/maps

        /proc/PID/maps: add a reference to mmap(2)

ip.7
    Radek Pazdera
        Document IP_MULTICAST_ALL
            This commit adds documentation for the IP_MULTICAST_ALL socket
            option.

            The option was added to the Linux kernel in 2.6.31:

                Author Nivedita Singhvi <niv@us.ibm.com>
                Commit f771bef98004d9d141b085d987a77d06669d4f4f

            The description is based on a previous one [3] posted by the
            original author of the code -- Nivedita, but it is slightly
            re-worded.

            I tested it myself and it works as described.

units.7
    Brian M. Carlson
        units should use an actual µ
            The units(7) man page uses an ASCII u in place of the actual Greek
            letter mu.  Since we're in the twenty-first century, with
            UTF-8-compatible terminals and terminal emulators, we should use
            the actual letter µ instead of an ASCII approximation.

Newly documented interfaces in existing pages
---------------------------------------------

perf_event_open.2
    Vince Weaver
        Add PERF_IOC_FLAG_GROUP documentation
            The perf_event_open() ENABLE/DISABLE/RESET ioctls can take an
            argument, PERF_IOC_FLAG_GROUP.  This wasn't documented at all
            until about a year ago (despite the support being there from
            the beginning) so I missed this when initially writing
            the man page.

socket.7
    Pavel Emelyanov, Michael Kerrisk
        Document SO_PEEK_OFF option
            Since Linux 3.4 there appeared an ability to specify the
            offset in bytes from which the data will be MSG_PEEK-ed.
            Describe this socket option in the socket(7) page, where
            all the other socket options are described.


Global changes
--------------

Various pages
    Michael Kerrisk
        Convert inline formatting (\fX...\fP) to dot-directive formatting

readdir.2
asprintf.
getline.3
getlogin.3
pthread_setname_np.3
readdir.3
strerror.3
    Michael Kerrisk  [Jon Grant]
        Clarify that terminating null byte is '\0'


Changes to individual pages
---------------------------

execve.2
    Peter LaDow
       Add envp to the Linux notes about NULL pointers
            During the review of static analysis results, we discovered a
            functional, but non-portable, use of execve().  For example:

                char *cmd[] = { "/path/to/some/file", NULL };
                execve(cmd[0], cmd, NULL);

            The call succeeds.  Yet, the static analysis tool (rightly)
            pointed out that envp could be dereferenced.  But digging into
            glibc and the kernel, it appears that like argv, envp when NULL
            is treated as if it were an empty list.

            So, to clear things up, I'm submitting this patch to update the
            man page to indicate that envp is treated like argv.

fallocate.2
    Michael Kerrisk
        RETURN VALUE: mention that 'errno' is set on error

io_setup.2
    Cyril Hrubis  [Jeff Moyer]
        Clarify the nr_events parameter
            Currently the io_setup.2 man page describes what the kernel really
            does, i.e., that the resulting context may be able to hold more
            than the 'nr_event's operations because the memory allocated in
            kernel is rounded to be multiple of page size.

            It is better not to expose this implementation detail and
            simply state that the resulting context is suitable for
            'nr_events' operations.

perf_event_open.2
    Vince Weaver
        Clarify the perf_event_open() wakeup_events/wakeup_watermark fields
            Clarify the perf_event_open() wakeup_events/wakeup_watermark
            fields a bit, based on info from kernel commit cfeb1d90a1b1.
    Vince Weaver
        Update to match the Linux 3.10 release
            This patch updates the perf_event_open() documentation to include
            new interfaces added in the 3.10 kernel.

            It also documents a few [To be documented] instances left over
            from the 3.7 kernel.
    Vince Weaver
        Small correction to description of 'flags' argument

prctl.2
    Michael Kerrisk
        Note equivalents of PR_SET_NAME
            pthread_setname_np() and pthread_getname_np() and
            /proc/self/task/TID/comm provide access to the same
            attribute.

pread.2

alloca.3
    Adrian Bunk
        Correct information on getting non-inlined version with gcc+glibc

            - add -std=c11 to the list of strict options
            - emphasize more that both the gcc option and not including
              alloca.h are needed

        The inherit-scheduler attribute must be set to PTHREAD_EXPLICIT_SCHED
            In order for the attributes set by these functions to have
            an effect, the caller must use pthread_attr_setinheritsched(3)
            to set the inherit-scheduler attribute of the attributes object
            to PTHREAD_EXPLICIT_SCHED.

            returned by getenv() after calling setenv() on the same
            environment variable. The tz string may be invalid as per
            getenv.3:

                    "The string pointed to by the return value of getenv()
                     may be statically allocated, and can be modified by a

Changes to individual pages
---------------------------

clock_nanosleep.2
futex.2
nanosleep.2
poll.2
sigaction.2
sigreturn.2
signal.7
    Michael Kerrisk
        SEE ALSO: add restart_syscall(2)

open.2
    Michael Kerrisk [Geoffrey Thomas]
        Remove warning that O_DIRECTORY is only for use with opendir(3)
            O_DIRECTORY can also be used with, for example, O_PATH.

perf_event_open.2
    Vince Weaver
        Improve PERF_SAMPLE_BRANCH_STACK documentation
    Vince Weaver
        Fix indentation of the MMAP layout section
            The indentation of the MMAP layout section wasn't quite right.
            I think this improves things but I admit I'm not an expert at the
            low-level indentation directives.
    Vince Weaver
        Update PERF_IOC_FLAG_GROUP info
            It turns out PERF_IOC_FLAG_GROUP was broken from 75f937f24bd9
            (in Linux 2.6.31, the initial perf_event release) until
            724b6daa1 (Linux 3.4).

            I've done some extensive kernel source code digging plus
            running tests of various kernels and I hope the info
            presented is accurate now.

            (Patch edited somewhat by mtk.)
    Vince Weaver
        Improve sysfs files documentation
            This improves the documentation of the various
            perf_event_open()-related sysfs files.

ptrace.2
    Denys Vlasenko  [Oleg Nesterov, Dmitry V. Levin]
        If SEIZE was used, initial auto-attach stop is EVENT_STOP
            For every PTRACE_O_TRACEfoo option, mention that old-style SIGSTOP
            is replaced by PTRACE_EVENT_STOP if PTRACE_SEIZE attach was used.

            Mention the same thing again in the description of
            PTRACE_EVENT_STOP.
    Denys Vlasenko  [Oleg Nesterov, Dmitry V. Levin]
        Mention that PTRACE_PEEK* libc API and kernel API are different
    Denys Vlasenko  [Oleg Nesterov, Dmitry V. Levin]
        Clarify PTRACE_INTERRUPT, PTRACE_LISTEN, and group-stop behavior

readlink.2
    Michael Kerrisk
        Document use of empty 'pathname' argument
    Michael Kerrisk
        Change error check in example program from "< 0" to "== -1"
    Chuck Coffing
        Fix possible race condition in readlink.2 example
            I noticed that the example in the readlink.2 man pages does error
            checking for a race condition that would cause the value of the
            symbolic link to get larger.  However, it doesn't handle the
            opposite case, in which the value gets shorter.  (The NULL
            terminator is always set at the old, longer offset.)  This could
            cause the program to operate on uninitialized data.

setpgid.2
    Michael Kerrisk  [Graud]
        s/SIGTSTP/SIGTTIN/ when discussing reads from terminal
            See https://bugzilla.kernel.org/show_bug.cgi?id=60504

Newly documented interfaces in existing pages
---------------------------------------------

ioctl_list.2
    Zsbán Ambrus
        Document FAT_IOCTL_GET_ATTRIBUTES
            The attached patch adds four ioctls from linux/msdos_fs.h to the
            ioctl_list(2) manpage.

            The ioctl FAT_IOCTL_GET_ATTRIBUTES reads FAT attributes of a
            file a mounted vfat file system.  I tested this on Linux
            2.6.33, an example script can be found at
            http://www.perlmonks.com/?node_id=832623


Global changes
--------------

Various pages
    Michael Kerrisk
        Global fix: s/file system/filesystem/
            Notwithstanding 24d01c530c5a3f75217543d02bf6712395e5f90c,
            "filesystem" is the form used by the great majority of man pages
            outside the man-pages project and in a number of other sources,
            so let's go with that.


Changes to individual pages
---------------------------

access.2
    J. Bruce Fields
        Fix outdated NFS information
            Note that NFS versions since version 3 support an "access" call
            so that the client doesn't have to guess permissions or ID
            mapping on its own.

            (See RFC 1813 sections 1.7 and 3.3.4.)

adjtimex.2
    Michael Kerrisk
        SEE ALSO: Add adjtimex(8)

clock_getres.2
    Michael Kerrisk  [Rodrigo Campos]
        Note circumstances in which "SMP" note applies.
    Michael Kerrisk
        Add kernel version for CLOCK_*_CPUTIME_ID
            CLOCK_PROCESS_CPUTIME_ID and CLOCK_THREAD_CPUTIME_ID
            appeared in 2.6.12.
    Michael Kerrisk
        Add VERSIONS section

futex.2
    Michael Kerrisk
        The 'timeout' can be rounded upwards by clock granularity and also overrun

kill.2
    Michael Kerrisk
        Small improvements to text on historical rules for permissions

nfsservctl.2
    Michael Kerrisk
        Note commands that were only in Linux 2.4.x and earlier

open.2
    Robert Harris
        Add mmap(2) to list of calls that fail when given an O_PATH descriptor
    Doug Goldstein
        Add EINVAL to errors list
            EINVAL can be returned by open(2) when the underlying filesystem
            doesn't support O_DIRECT. It is documented in the NOTES section
            but this patch adds it to the list of possible errors.

perf_event_open.2
    Vince Weaver
        PERF_SAMPLE_BRANCH_STACK updates
            This started out as just adding the new perf_event_open features
            from Linux 3.11 (which was the addition of transactional memory
            defines for PERF_SAMPLE_BRANCH_STACK samples) but turned into a
            general cleanup of the PERF_SAMPLE_BRANCH_STACK documentation.

            The main clarification is that at least one of the non-privilege
            values must be set or else perf_event_open() will return an EINVAL
            error.
    Michael Kerrisk
        Reorder text describing fields of 'perf_event_header' structure
            Place the fields with the shorter descriptions first, to make the
            information easier to read.

poll.2
    Michael Kerrisk
        Clarify wording of 'timeout' as a "minimum" interval

sched_setaffinity.2
    Michael Kerrisk  [Christos Tsopokis]
        Clarify that these system calls affect a per-thread attribute

sched_setparam.2
    Michael Kerrisk
        Clarify that this system call applies to threads (not processes)

sched_setscheduler.2
    Michael Kerrisk
        Clarify that this system call applies to threads (not processes)

select.2
    Michael Kerrisk  [G.raud]

    Michael Kerrisk
        Wording improvements

        Correct header file in SYNOPSIS

sigwaitinfo.2
    Michael Kerrisk

    Johan Erlandsson
        Add missing argument in example
    Johan Erlandsson
        Correct registers for arm/EABI
            Registers was off by one.

drand48_r.3
    Peng Haitao

    Michael Kerrisk  [Will Newton]
        Clarify wording on "return value" when size==0

printf.3
    Christopher Hall
        Correctly describe the meaning of a negative precision
            The printf(3) manpage says that a negative precision is taken to
            be zero, whereas printf(3p) says that a negative precision is
            taken as if the precision were omitted.  glibc agrees with the
            latter (POSIX) specification.

            Test code:

                printf("%f\n",42.0);      // "42.000000"
                printf("%.*f\n",0,42.0);  // "42"
                printf("%.*f\n",-1,42.0); // "42.000000"

            This patch corrects the explanation to match what actually happens.

            Attempt to document fields in the /proc/[pid]/io file, based on
            the Documentation/filesystems/proc.txt. The text will probably
            need some grammar corrections.
    Michael Kerrisk  [Marko Myllynen]
        /proc/sys/fs/inode-max went away in Linux 2.4
            Also, the 'preshrink' field in /proc/sys/fs/inode-state became
            a dummy value in Linux 2.4.

Global changes
--------------

assert.3
assert_perror.3
rexec.3
rpc.3
    Michael Kerrisk  [Jon Grant]
        Reword a sentence to use more gender-neutral language


Changes to individual pages
---------------------------

execve.2
    Michael Kerrisk
        'arg...' for interpreter scripts starts with argv[1]

fallocate.2
    Christoph Hellwig
        Clarify the zeroing behavior
            fallocate() zeroes only space that did not previously contain
            data, but leaves existing data untouched.

futex.2
    Rodrigo Campos
        Fix link to Rusty's futex example library
            When I asked to webmaster@kernel.org, Konstantin Ryabitsev
            answered that the ".nl." is "an obsolete scheme and really
            should be changed to just ftp.kernel.org".

getgroups.2
    Michael Kerrisk
        Note that NGROUPS_MAX is defined in <limits.h>
    Michael Kerrisk
        Clarify that sysconf(_SC_NGROUPS_MAX) is a run-time technique
    Michael Kerrisk
        Document /proc/sys/kernel/ngroups_max

ioctl.2
    Michael Kerrisk  [KOSAKI Motohiro, David Gibson]
        'request' argument is typed as 'unsigned long' in glibc
            See https://bugzilla.kernel.org/show_bug.cgi?id=42705

perf_event_open.2
    Vince Weaver
        Linux 3.12 rdpmc/mmap
            It turns out that the perf_event mmap page rdpmc/time setting was
            broken, dating back to the introduction of the feature.  Due
            to a mistake with a bitfield, two different values mapped to
            the same feature bit.

            A new somewhat backwards compatible interface was introduced
            in Linux 3.12.  A much longer report on the issue can be found
            here:
               https://lwn.net/Articles/567894/
    Vince Weaver
        Linux 3.12 adds PERF_SAMPLE_IDENTIFIER
            A new PERF_SAMPLE_IDENTIFIER sample type was added in Linux 3.12.
    Vince Weaver
        E2BIG documentation
            The following documents the E2BIG error return for
            perf_event_open().

            I actually ran into this error the hard way and it took me
            half a day to figure out why my ->size value was changing.
    Vince Weaver
        Linux 3.12 adds PERF_EVENT_IOC_ID
            A new perf_event related ioctl, PERF_EVENT_IOC_ID, was added
            in Linux 3.12.
    Vince Weaver
        PERF_COUNT_SW_DUMMY support
            Support for the PERF_COUNT_SW_DUMMY event type was added in
            Linux 3.12.
    Vince Weaver  [Andreas Sandberg]
        PERF_EVENT_IOC_PERIOD update
            The PERF_EVENT_IOC_PERIOD ioctl was broken until 2.6.36,
            and it turns out that the ARM architecture has some
            differing behavior too.

pipe.2
    Trevor Bramwell
        Fix error in example program

poll.2
    Michael Kerrisk  [Paolo Bonzini]
        Clarify meaning of events==0
            events==0 does not mean that revents is always returned as
            zero. The "output only" events (POLLHUP, POLLERR, POLLNVAL)
            can still be returned.

            See https://bugzilla.kernel.org/show_bug.cgi?id=61911

readlink.2
    Michael Kerrisk  [Yuanhang Zheng]
        Fix typo in error message in example program

recv.2
    Michael Kerrisk
        Remove out-of-date statement that UNIX domain does not support MSG_TRUNC
            Should have removed that sentence as part of
            commit a25601b48b822eb1882ae336574b8d062a17e564

sched_get_priority_max.2

    Michael Kerrisk
        Note filesystem support for nanosecond timestamps
            Add some detail on which native filesystems do and don't
            support nanosecond timestamps.
    Michael Kerrisk
        Cosmetic reworking of timestamp discussion in NOTES
    Michael Kerrisk  [Yang Yang]
        Update discussion of nanosecond timestamps
            The existing text describes the timestamp fields as 'time_t'
            and delegates discussion of nanosecond timestamps under NOTES.
            Nanosecond timestamps have been around for a while now,
            and are in POSIX.1-2008, so reverse the orientation of the
            discussion, putting the nanosecond fields into DESCRIPTION
            and detailing the historical situation under NOTES.

symlink.2
    Michael Kerrisk
        Further fine tuning of argument names
            Follow-up to f2ae6dde0c68448bec986d12fe32268a2c98bfd9
            See https://sourceware.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=16073

kcmp.3
    Shawn Landden
        Reword slightly awkward section

malloc.3
    Greg Price
        Scale back promises of alignment
            It's not true that the return value is suitably aligned for "any
            variable"; for example, it's unsuitable for a variable like
              float *x __attribute__ ((__vector_size__ (32)));
            which requires 32-byte alignment.  Types like this are defined in
            <avxintrin.h>, and with 16-byte alignment in <emmintrin.h> and
            <xmmintrin.h>, so the application programmer need not even know
            that a vector_size attribute has been applied.

            On an x86 architecture, a program that loads from or stores to a
            pointer with this type derived from malloc can crash because GCC
            generates an aligned load/store, like MOVDQA.

            The C99 standard (TC3, as of N1256) does say the return value is
            suitably aligned for "any type of object".  The C11 standard (as
            of N1570) revises this to any type with "fundamental alignment",
            which means an alignment "supported by the implementation in all
            contexts", which I suppose tautologically includes aligning
            malloc/realloc return values.

            The actual behavior of current glibc malloc is to align to the
            greater of 2 * sizeof(size_t) and __alignof__ (long double),
            which may be one bit greater than this commit promises.

mq_receive.3

New and rewritten pages
-----------------------

fgetc.3
gets.3
    David Malcolm
        Split gets(3) to isolate unsafe gets(3) to a page on its own
            Currently man3/gets.3 documents various safe I/O functions, along
            with the toxic "gets" function.

            At the risk of being melodramatic, this strikes me as akin to
            storing rat poison in a food cabinet, in the same style of
            packaging as the food, but with a post-it note on it saying
            "see warnings below".

            I think such "never use this" functions should be quarantined
            into their own manpages, rather than listing them alongside
            sane functions.

            The attached patch does this for "gets", moving the documentation
            of the good functions from man3/gets.3 into man3/fgetc.3,
            updating the SO links in the relevant functions to point at the
            latter.

            It then rewrites man3/gets.3 to spell out that "gets" is toxic
            and should never be used (with a link to CWE-242 for good
            measure).
    Michael Kerrisk  [Andre Majorel]
        Tweaks to David Malcolm's patch

vdso.7
    Mike Frysinger
        New page documenting the vDSO mapped into each process by the kernel


Newly documented interfaces in existing pages
---------------------------------------------

reboot.2
    Elie De Brauwer
        Document LINUX_REBOOT_SW_SUSPEND


New and changed links
---------------------

fgets.3
getc.3
getchar.3
ungetc.3
    Michael Kerrisk
        Adjust links to gets(3) to point to fgetc(3)


Global changes
--------------

Various pages
    Michael Kerrisk
        Global fix of "NULL pointer"
            Change "NULL pointer" to "NULL" or null pointer".
            POSIX uses the term "null pointer", not "NULL pointer".

Various pages
    Michael Kerrisk
        Stylistic changes to code example
            For ease of reading, don't embed assignments inside if().

Various pages
    Michael Kerrisk
        Replace uses of "i.e.," in main text with "that is" or similar
            Usual man-pages style is to use "i.e." only within
            parenthetical expressions.

Various pages
    Michael Kerrisk
        Replace uses of "e.g." in main text with "for example" or similar
                Usual man-pages style is to use "e.g." only within
                parenthetical expressions.

Various pages
    Michael Kerrisk
        Add "Program source" subheading under EXAMPLE

Various pages
    Michael Kerrisk
        Add "static" to global variables and functions in example program


Changes to individual pages
---------------------------

clock_getres.2
    Michael Kerrisk  [Nadav Har'El]
        Improve description of CLOCK_PROCESS_CPUTIME_ID
            See https://bugzilla.kernel.org/show_bug.cgi?id=67291

close.2
    Michael Kerrisk  [P?draig Brady]
        Note that errors from close() should be used only for diagnosis
            In particular, retrying after EINTR is a bad idea.

            See http://austingroupbugs.net/view.php?id=529

            See http://thread.gmane.org/gmane.comp.lib.glibc.alpha/37702
            Subject: [RFC][BZ #14627] Make linux close errno to EINPROGRESS
                     when interrupted in signal.

execve.2
    Michael Kerrisk  [Marco Dione]
        Add further cases to EFAULT error
            See https://sourceware.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=16402

perf_event_open.2
    Vince Weaver  [Sudhanshu Goswami]
        Clarify issues with the disabled bit
            Clarify the perf_event_open behavior with respect to the disabled
            bit and creating event groups.
    Vince Weaver  [Sudhanshu Goswami]
        Clarify issues with the exclusive bit
            Warn that using the perf_event_open "exclusive" bit, while
            it might seem like a good idea, might lead to all 0 results
            in some common usage cases.

reboot.2
    Elie De Brauwer
        Mention RB_POWER_OFF
            The manpage did not mention RB_POWER_OFF which is the glibc
            symbolic name for LINUX_REBOOT_CMD_POWER_OFF.

            $ cd /usr/include
            $ cat x86_64-linux-gnu/sys/reboot.h | grep POWER_OFF
             define RB_POWER_OFF        0x4321fedc
    Elie De Brauwer
        Add "Linux" to kernel version numbers
    Michael Kerrisk
        Add RB_SW_SUSPEND synonym
    Michael Kerrisk
        Add RB_KEXEC synonym

setpgid.2
    Michael Kerrisk  [Joseph S. Myers]
        BSD getpgrp() and setpgrp() go away in glibc 2.19

socket.2
    Michael Kerrisk  [Dongsheng Song]
        Remove crufty statement that AF_INET does not support SOCK_SEQPACKET
            Linux AF_INET supports SOCK_SEQPACKET via SCTP.

syscall.2
    Mike Frysinger
        Fix ia64 registers
            The original list of registers was created by confusing strace
            source code--this is for parsing legacy 32-bit code (which is
            dead and no one cares). Update the list to reflect native ia64
            syscall interface.

syscall.2
syscalls.2
getauxval.3
    Mike Frysinger
        Add references to new vdso(7) page

utimensat.2
    Michael Kerrisk
        Small wording improvement for times!=NULL case

dlopen.3
    Michael Kerrisk  [Mike Frysinger]
        Update remarks on cast needed when assigning dlsym() return value
            POSIX.1-2013 eases life when casting the dlsym() return value to a
            function pointer
    Michael Kerrisk  [Stephen Kell]
        Fix description of dli_sname
            See https://sourceware.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=16262

getline.3
    Michael Kerrisk  [Luke Hutchison]
        Correct description of how '*n' is used when '*lineptr' == NULL
            See https://sourceware.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=5468
    Michael Kerrisk
        Remove SEE ALSO reference to unsafe gets(3)

mcheck.3
    Simon Paillard  [Raphael Geissert]
        typo in compiler flag
            See http://bugs.debian.org/732464

mkstemp.3
    Michael Kerrisk  [Janne Blomqvist]
        Better describe 'flags' that can be specified for mkostemp()

printf.3
    Michael Kerrisk  [Arif Zaman]
        Fix memory leak in snprintf() example
            See http://stackoverflow.com/questions/19933479/snprintf-man-page-example-memory-leak

pthread_kill.3
    Michael Kerrisk  [Mathieu Desnoyers]
        POSIX.1-2008 removes ESRCH
            POSIX.1-2001 mistakenly documented an ESRCH error, and
            POSIX.1-2008 removes this error. Glibc does return
            this error in cases where it can determine that a thread ID
            is invalid, but equally, the use of an invalid thread ID
            can cause a segmentation fault.

puts.3
    Michael Kerrisk
        SEE ALSO: replace reference to gets(3) with fgets(3)

scanf.3
    Michael Kerrisk  [Ondřej Bílka]

        BSD sigpause() goes away in glibc 2.19
    Michael Kerrisk
        Correct feature text macro requirements
    Peng Haitao
        ATTRIBUTES: Note function that is thread-safe

            The functions sincos(), sincosf() and sincosl() are thread safe.

string.3
    Moritz 'Morty' Strübe
        Add short description of the functions
            It is helpful to have a short description about what the different
            functions in string.h do.
    Michael Kerrisk
        Fixes and enhancements to Moritz Strübe's patch

strptime.3
    Michael Kerrisk  [Mathieu Malaterre, Simon Paillard]
        Add number ranges to comments in 'tm' structure
            See http://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=729570
    Michael Kerrisk

        Some rewording and reorganization

strsep.3
    Michael Kerrisk
        Clarify description
            The use of "symbols" in the existing description is confusing;

strspn.3
    Michael Kerrisk  [Mathieu Malaterre]
        Improve description in NAME
            See http://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=723659

            The descriptions are based on information provided by Andi Kleen,
            both in the e-mail

                [PATCH 1/6] perf, core: Add generic transaction flags v5

            sent to the linux-kernel list as well as an e-mail

                [PATCH] Document transaction flags in perf_event_open manpage

            sent to the linux-man list.

            The implementation is based heavily on the Intel Haswell
            processor.  Documentation can be found at this page:
            http://software.intel.com/en-us/blogs/2013/05/03/intelr-transactional-synchronization-extensions-intelr-tsx-profiling-with-linux-0
            as well as in section 18.11.5.1 of volume 3 of the
            Intel 64 and IA-32 Architecture Software Developer's Manual.

        Add description for PTRACE_PEEKSIGINFO
            Retrieve signals without removing them from a queue.
    Andrey Vagin
        Add description for PTRACE_GETSIGMASK and PTRACE_SETSIGMASK
            These two commands allow to examine and change mask of blocked
            signals.

New and rewritten pages
-----------------------

A note from Christoph Hellwig prompted me to perform a task that has
been queued for a while: merging the text of the man pages for the
*at([23]) ("directory file descriptor") APIs into their corresponding
traditional pages.  When the *at([23]) pages were originally written
(mostly in 2006), the APIs were not part of POSIX and (in most cases)
were not available on other systems. So, it made some sense to wall
them off into their own separate pages. Eight years later, with the
APIs now all in POSIX (except scandirat()), it is much more sensible
to document the newer APIs alongside their traditional counterparts,
so that the newer APIs are not "hidden", and the reader can more
easily see the differences between the APIs.

Thus, the text of 14 pairs of pages has been merged, and the "merged
from" pages have been converted to links to the "merged to" pages.
Along the way, a few other fixes were made to the pages, as noted
below.

One page that did not undergo such a change was utimensat(2), which
is different enough from utime(2) that it warrants a separate page.
Unlike the other *at() pages, the utimensat(2) page was also already
self-contained, rather than defining itself in terms of differences
from utime(2) as the other *at() pages did.

        Make it clearer that glibc and syscall APIs differ for PTRACE_PEEK*
            Thanks to Denys Vlasenko's additions in 78686915aed6bd12
            this page does note that the glibc API for PTRACE_PEEK*
            differs from the raw syscall interface. But, as the report
            at https://bugzilla.kernel.org/show_bug.cgi?id=70801 shows,
            this information could be more obvious. This patch makes its so.

resolv.conf.5
    Carlos O'Donell
        DESCRIPTION: mention that the data is trusted
            In a recent discussion about DNSSEC it was brought to my
            attention that not all system administrators may understand
            that the information in /etc/resolv.conf is fully trusted.
            The resolver implementation in glibc treats /etc/resolv.conf
            as a fully trusted source of DNS information and passes on
            the AD-bit for DNSSEC as trusted.

            This patch adds a clarifying sentence to make it absolutely
            clear that indeed this source of information is trusted.

Removed Pages
-------------

sync.8
    Michael Kerrisk  [Christoph Hellwig, Pádraig Brady]
        Sometime in the 20th century (before my watch), a sync(8)
        page into man-pages. It documents the sync command from
        "fileutils", which long ago become coreutils, and the
        piece under NOTES note some behavior of sync(2)
        that ceased to be true many years ago.  The man-pages
	project generally focuses on only Linux kernel and
        (g)libc interfaces, so this sync(8) page doesn't really
	belong.  Furthermore, coreutils has a sync(1) page which
	covers the same command. After discussions on the
	coreutils list, I've decided to retire this page from
	man-pages.

Changes to individual pages
---------------------------

clone.2
    Michael Kerrisk
        Note that CLONE_THREAD also in effect requires CLONE_VM

stat.2
    Michael Kerrisk  [Marius Gaubas]
        Warn the reader that the 'stat' structure definition is not precise
            Padding fields aren't shown, and the order of fields varies
            somewhat across architectures.

gethostbyname.3
    Michael Kerrisk
        Remove redundant FTM requirements
            _GNU_SOURCE implies _SVID_SOURCE and _BSD_SOURCE, so

                _BSD_SOURCE || _SVID_SOURCE || _GNU_SOURCE

            is the same as

                _BSD_SOURCE || _SVID_SOURCE

getutmp.3

        SEE ALSO: add utmpdump(1)

log1p.3

sem_destroy.3
    Peng Haitao
        ATTRIBUTES: Note function that is thread-safe
            The function sem_destroy() is thread safe.

sem_getvalue.3

        Fix a bug, and improve discussion of forcing termination with strncpy()

strspn.3
    Peng Haitao
        ATTRIBUTES: Note functions that are thread-safe
            The functions strspn() and strcspn() are thread safe.

tmpnam.3
    Michael Kerrisk

feature_test_macros.7
    Michael Kerrisk
        _BSD_SOURCE and _SVID_SOURCE are deprecated in glibc 2.20
    Michael Kerrisk
        _GNU_SOURCE implicitly defines other macros
            Saying that _GNU_SOURCE has the "effects of" other macros is not
            quite precise.
    Michael Kerrisk
        Reword glibc version for _ISOC95_SOURCE
    Michael Kerrisk
        _ISOC99_SOURCE also exposes C95 definitions
    Michael Kerrisk
        _ISOC11_SOURCE implies the effects of _ISOC99_SOURCE
    Michael Kerrisk
        Note version number for _POSIX_C_SOURCE >= 200112L implies C99/C95
            _POSIX_C_SOURCE >= 200112L causes C95 definitions to be
            exposed only since glibc 2.12 and C99 definitions only
            since 2.10.
    Michael Kerrisk
        _XOPEN_SOURCE may implicitly define _POSIX_SOURCE and _POSIX_C_SOURCE

    Michael Kerrisk
        _POSIX_C_SOURCE >= 200112L implies C95 and C95 features

mount.2
    Michael Kerrisk
        SEE ALSO: add blkid(1)

msgop.2
    Michael Kerrisk
        Document two MSG_COPY failure modes
            Since Linux 3.14, the kernel now diagnoses two errors
            when using msgrcv() MSG_COPY:
            * MSG_COPY must be specified with IPC_NOWAIT
            * MSG_COPY can't be specified with MSG_EXCEPT

open.2
    Michael Kerrisk
        Organize some material under additional subheadings in NOTES
            There's an amorphous mass of material under NOTES.  Structure
            it with some subheadings, and do a little reorganizing.
    Michael Kerrisk
        Add other system calls and functions that are like openat()
            fanotify_mark(2), name_to_handle_at(2), and scandirat(3) have a
            directory file descriptor argument for the same reason as openat().
            Also: reword the rationale for the *at() functions somewhat.
    Michael Kerrisk
        Clarify ELOOP error interaction with O_PATH

readahead.2
    Phillip Susi  [Corrado Zoccolo, Gregory P. Smith, Zhu Yanhai, Michael Kerrisk, Christoph Hellwig]
        Don't claim the call blocks until all data has been read
            The readahead(2) man page was claiming that the call blocks until
            all data has been read into the cache.  This is incorrect.

            See https://bugzilla.kernel.org/show_bug.cgi?id=54271

stat.2
    Michael Kerrisk
        SEE ALSO: add ls(1) and stat(1)

fts.3
    Christoph Hellwig  [Michael Kerrisk]
        The fts(3) API does not work with LFS builds
            As pointed out during a recent discussion on libc-hacker the
            fts(3) APIs can't be used with large file offsets:

                https://sourceware.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=15838

toupper.3
    Michael Kerrisk
        Rewrite to more explicitly bring locales into the discussion
    Michael Kerrisk

feature_test_macros.7
    Michael Kerrisk  [Joseph S. Myers]
        Remove mention of bogus _ISOC95_SOURCE macro
            The _ISOC95_SOURCE macro is defined in <features.h>, but it
            does nothing. So remove discussion of it, and move some of
            the discussion of C95 under the _ISOC99_SOURCE subhead.
    Michael Kerrisk  [Carlos O'Donell]
        Add packaging note for _BSD_SOURCE/_SVID_SOURCE/_DEFAULT_SOURCE
            To compile warning-free across glibc < 2.20 and glibc >= 2.20
            code may been to define both _DEFAULT_SOURCE and either
            _BSD_SOURCE or _SVID_SOURCE.

        Reword description of C90

locale.7
    Michael Kerrisk
        Add subsection on POSIX.1-2008 (originally GNU) extensions to locale API
    Michael Kerrisk
        Remove reference to LI18NUX2000
            LI18NUX2000 is difficult to even find these days, and in any case
            this page does not document gettext(), so notes about gettext()
            in the CONFORMING TO section here make no sense.
    Michael Kerrisk

        Fix error in discussion of MIN > 0, TIME == 0 noncanonical mode
            As reported by Peter Hurley, for the MIN > 0, TIME == 0 case:

                read() may unblock when MIN bytes are available but return
                up to the 'count' parameter if more input arrives in between
                waking and copying into the user buffer.
                ...
                read() may also _not_ return until MIN bytes have been
                received, even if 'count' bytes have been received.
    Michael Kerrisk

    Michael Kerrisk
        name_to_handle_at(2) and open_by_handle_at(2) optionally follow symlinks
    Michael Kerrisk
        Mention use of readlink(2) to read contents of a symlink

New and rewritten pages
-----------------------

fanotify_init.2
    Heinrich Schuchardt, Michael Kerrisk
        New page documenting fanotify_init(2)

fanotify_mark.2
    Heinrich Schuchardt, Michael Kerrisk
        New page documenting fanotify_mark(2)

sched_setscheduler.2
    Michael Kerrisk
        Page rewritten
            Stripped out the general scheduling material, which
            moved to sched(7), and rewrote much of the remainder.
            Changed copyright and license since pretty much all
            of the content was or is written by mtk.

fanotify.7
    Heinrich Schuchardt, Michael Kerrisk
        New page providing overview of the fanotify API

sched.7
    Michael Kerrisk
        New page providing an overview of the scheduling APIs
            Most of this content derives from sched_setscheduler(2). In
            preparation for adding a sched_setattr(2) page, it makes
            sense to isolate out this general content to a separate
            page that is referred to by the other scheduling pages.


Newly documented interfaces in existing pages
---------------------------------------------

fallocate.2
    Lukas Czerner [Michael Kerrisk]
        Document FALLOC_FL_ZERO_RANGE
            FALLOC_FL_ZERO_RANGE was added in Linux 3.14,
            for zeroing ranges in the allocated space in a file.

rename.2
    Miklos Szeredi [Michael Kerrisk]
        Document renameat2() system call added in Linux 3.15

shmop.2
    Michael Kerrisk
        Document SHM_EXEC


Changes to individual pages
---------------------------

flock.2
    Michael Kerrisk
        Employ term "open file description" in DESCRIPTION
            And include reference to open(2) for an explanation of the term.

getpriority.2
    Michael Kerrisk
        SEE ALSO: add sched(7)

getsockopt.2
    Carsten Andrich
        SEE ALSO: add packet(7)

link.2
    Michael Kerrisk  [Steven Stewart-Gallus]
        Document ENOENT error for linkat()
            See https://bugzilla.kernel.org/show_bug.cgi?id=73301

msgget.2
    Michael Kerrisk
        Reword EEXIST error

msgop.2
    Michael Kerrisk
        Note capability required to raise MQ size beyond MSGMNB

msync.2
    Michael Kerrisk  [Heinrich Schuchardt]
        s/flushes... back to disk/flushes... back to filesystem/

nice.2
    Michael Kerrisk
        SEE ALSO: add sched(7)

open.2
    Peter Schiffer
        Update note on alignment of user buffer and file offset for O_DIRECT
            The sentence in open(2) man page in notes for O_DIRECT flag:

                "Under Linux 2.6, alignment to 512-byte boundaries suffices."

            is not universally correct. The alignment is a property of the
            storage, for example, 4k-sector drives with no 512 byte sector
            emulation will be unable to perform 512-byte direct I/O.
    Michael Kerrisk
        Note some of the various synonyms for "open file description"
    Michael Kerrisk
        Remove repetitious text on use of fcntl() to change file status flags

open_by_handle_at.2
    Michael Kerrisk
        Mention FreeBSD analogs

posix_fadvise.2
    Michael Kerrisk  [Eric Siegerman]
        Fix wording error under "Architecture-specific variants"
            See https://bugzilla.kernel.org/show_bug.cgi?id=75431

    Michael Kerrisk  [Stijn Hinterding]
        Add feature test macro requirements
            The _GNU_SOURCE FTM must be defined.

read.2
    Michael Kerrisk
        BUGS: detail nonatomicity bug with respect to file offset updates
            This bug was fixed in Linux 3.14, with commit
            9c225f2655e36a470c4f58dbbc99244c5fc7f2d4
            See also http://thread.gmane.org/gmane.linux.kernel/1649458

sched_setparam.2
    Michael Kerrisk
        Small changes consistent with migration of content to sched(7)

sched_yield.2
    Michael Kerrisk
        Small changes consistent with migration of content to sched(7)

semget.2
    Michael Kerrisk
        Consolidate discussion on noninitialization of semaphores
            The fact that semget() does not initialize the semaphores
            in a new set was covered in two places (in DESCRIPTION
            and BUGS). Consolidate these into one place (in NOTES)
            and also point out that POSIX.1-2008 says that a future
            version of the standard may require an implementation to
            initialize the semaphores to 0.
    Michael Kerrisk
        Clarify SEMMNS versus SEMMSL*SEMMNI
    Michael Kerrisk
        Rework EINVAL text a little
    Michael Kerrisk
        Clarify wording for EEXIST error

shmget.2
    Manfred Spraul
        Clarify SHMALL
            The default for SHMALL is a limit of 8 GB, regardless of
            PAGE_SIZE. The current documentation does not mention that
            and is therefore more difficult to understand than necessary.
    Manfred Spraul
        Correct math error
            2097152 is 2^21, not 2^20.
    Michael Kerrisk
        Reword EEXIST error
    Michael Kerrisk
        Clarify one of the EINVAL cases

        Fix kernel version numbers in discussion of SHMALL
    Michael Kerrisk
        Rework EINVAL text
    Michael Kerrisk
        Move and rework discussion of mode bits
    Michael Kerrisk

    Michael Kerrisk
        Add subheads for shmat() and shmdt()
    Michael Kerrisk
        Rework discussion of SHM_RDONLY and SHM_REMAP into list format
    Michael Kerrisk
        Structure the attach cases as a list

sigaction.2
    Alan Curry
        Fix bad cross reference (times(2) not time(2))
            The system call that reports child CPU usage is times(2),
            not time(2).

symlink.2
    Michael Kerrisk  [Steven Stewart-Gallus]
        Document ENOENT error for symlinkat()
            See https://bugzilla.kernel.org/show_bug.cgi?id=73301

syscalls.2
    Michael Kerrisk
        Add renameat2()
            And bump kernel version.

            This bug was fixed in Linux 3.14, with commit
            9c225f2655e36a470c4f58dbbc99244c5fc7f2d4
            See also http://thread.gmane.org/gmane.linux.kernel/1649458

    Peng Haitao
        ATTRIBUTES: Note functions that are thread-safe
            The functions pthread_attr_setschedpolicy() and
            pthread_attr_getschedpolicy() are thread safe.

    Peng Haitao
        ATTRIBUTES: Note functions that are thread-safe
            The functions pthread_attr_setscope() and pthread_attr_getscope()
            are thread safe.

            are thread safe.

sched_getcpu.3
    Michael Kerrisk
        SEE ALSO: add sched(7)

termios.3
    Michael Kerrisk  [Yuri Kozlov]
        Rework intro text for 'c_oflag'
    Michael Kerrisk
        OFDEL is in POSIX.1-2001, so remove "(Not in POSIX)" text

    Jan Moskyto Matejka  [Randy Dunlap]
        Improve description of /proc/stat 'intr' field

    Carsten Andrich  [Neil Horman]
        Improve sockopt documentation for packet sockets
    Carsten Andrich  [Willem de Bruijn]

    Michael Kerrisk
        NOTES: Add some subheadings

connect.2
    Michael Kerrisk  [William Morriss]
        ERRORS: Add EADDRNOTAVAIL for ephemeral port range exhaustion
            Verified from testing and the kernel source.
            See https://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=745775
    Michael Kerrisk
        Remove mention of ip_local_port_range under EAGAIN error

create_module.2
delete_module.2
init_module.2
query_module.2
    Michael Kerrisk  [Lucas De Marchi]
        Clarify glibc header file declaration/ABI wrapper details
            create_module(), delete_module(), init_module(), and
            query_module() are not declared in header files, but
            through an accident of history glibc provides an ABI
            for them that it continues to maintain, for
            compatibility reasons.

execve.2
    Michael Kerrisk  [Steven Stewart-Gallus]
        Note SIGKILL case when execve() fails beyond the point of no return
    Michael Kerrisk
        NOTES: Add a subheading and reorder paragraphs

fanotify_init.2
    Heinrich Schuchardt [Michael Kerrisk]
        Document range of permitted flags for event_f_flags
            With a new patch included in the mm tree, event_f_flags is
            checked for allowable values.

fcntl.2
    Michael Kerrisk
        Add "file locking" subheading under NOTES

fork.2
    Michael Kerrisk
        ERRORS: SCHED_DEADLINE tasks can fail with EAGAIN
            SCHED_DEADLINE tasks can fail with EAGAIN unless the
            reset-on-fork flag is set.

futex.2
    Michael Kerrisk
        Note that there is no glibc wrapper

getpriority.2
    Rasmus Villemoes
        Fix prototypes for getpriority() and setpriority()
            The who argument has type id_t (which happens to be u32 on linux).

get_robust_list.2
    Rasmus Villemoes
        Add <sys/types.h> to synopsis of get_robust_list()
            If one were to implement wrappers for [gs]et_robust_list() using the
            given prototypes, one would also have to include sys/types.h to get
            a definition of size_t.

getrusage.2
    Michael Kerrisk  [Bill Allombert]
        _GNU_SOURCE must be defined to obtain RUSAGE_THREAD definition
            See http://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=746569

link.2

    Michael Kerrisk
        ERRORS: Add EADDRINUSE for ephemeral port range exhaustion

mbind.2
    Rasmus Villemoes
        Fix prototype for mbind(2)
            The nmask argument is const. The return type in numaif.h is long.
            (Well, at least <numaif.h> says nmask is const. The current kernel
            does not define it as a const argument, but sys_mbind() only
            passes it to get_nodes(), which does treat it as const.)

msgop.2
    Davidlohr Bueso [Michael Kerrisk]
        Enhance description of "full queue" criteria

poll.2
    Rasmus Villemoes
        Add <signal.h> to synopsis for ppoll()
            One needs to #include <signal.h> to get the definition of the
            type (sigset_t) of the mask argument to ppoll().

readlink.2
    Rasmus Villemoes
        Fix return type of readlinkat()

recv.2
    Michael Kerrisk
        Clarify details of msg_name and msg_namelen fields

recvmmsg.2
    Michael Kerrisk
        Describe timeout bug
            See https://bugzilla.kernel.org/show_bug.cgi?id=75371
            and http://thread.gmane.org/gmane.linux.man/5677

remap_file_pages.2
    Andy Lutomirski [Christoph Hellwig, Andy Lutomirski]
        remap_file_pages() has no benefit for real files
            Linux commit 3ee6dafc677a68e461a7ddafc94a580ebab80735 caused
            remap_file_pages to be emulated when used on real file.

sched_get_priority_max.2
    Michael Kerrisk
        'policy' can also be SCHED_DEADLINE

sched_setaffinity.2
    Rasmus Villemoes
        Fix prototype for sched_setaffinity()
            The mask argument is const.

sched_setparam.2
    Michael Kerrisk
        ERRORS: mark errors that apply just for sched_setparam()
    Michael Kerrisk
        ERRORS: Add EINVAL for invalid arguments
    Michael Kerrisk
        SEE ALSO: add sched_setattr(2)

sched_setscheduler.2
    Michael Kerrisk
        ERRORS: mark errors that apply just to sched_setscheduler()
    Michael Kerrisk
        ERRORS: add EINVAL case for pid < 0
    Michael Kerrisk
        ERRORS: separate out EINVAL cases

semget.2
    Michael Kerrisk
        NOTES: Add subheadings and reorder paragraphs

semop.2
    Rasmus Villemoes
        Fix prototypes for semop() and semtimedop()
            The nsops arguments have type size_t, not unsigned, and the
            timeout argument of semtimedop() is const.
    Michael Kerrisk
        NOTES: Add a subheading

send.2
    Michael Kerrisk
        Add details on various 'msghdr' fields
    Michael Kerrisk
        ERRORS: Add EAGAIN for ephemeral port range exhaustion
    Michael Kerrisk
        Add some subheadings under DESCRIPTION

shmget.2
    Michael Kerrisk
        NOTES: Add a subheading

stat.2
    Michael Kerrisk  [Aurelien Jarno]

            That ordering is more logical

stime.2
    Rasmus Villemoes
        Fix prototype for stime()
            The argument is const, both according to the actual header files and
            according to <http://www.sco.com/developers/devspecs/vol1a.pdf>.

syscall.2
    Rasmus Villemoes
        Fix prototype for syscall()
            The first argument and the return value of syscall() has type long,
            not int.

getopt.3
    Michael Kerrisk
        EXAMPLE: Add subheadings to distinguish the two example programs

malloc.3
    Michael Kerrisk
        Reword text referring to mallopt(3)

pthreads.7
    Michael Kerrisk
        Change references to "sched_setscheduler(2)" to "sched(7)"

    Peng Haitao
        ATTRIBUTES: Note functions that are thread-safe
            The functions pthread_setschedparam() and pthread_getschedparam()
            are thread safe.

pthread_setschedprio.3
    Peng Haitao
        ATTRIBUTES: Note function that is thread-safe

stpcpy.3
    Ingo Schwarze
        Note some history of stpcpy()
            Quoting Ingo:
            I just noticed that the stpcpy(3) manual contains a speculation
            that appears to be untrue on closer investigation:  That function
            did not originate in MS DOS, but in Lattice C on AmigaDOS.

            Here is a patch against the git master HEAD to fix that, and add
            some more historical information.  To provide some background and
            allow you to more easily verify the correctness of the patch, i'm
            appending my mail to <misc@openbsd.org>, where i'm giving some
            more details about the history and pointing to some primary
            sources.  That mail also contains the (similar, but shorter)
            patch i just committed to the OpenBSD manual page.

strcasecmp.3
    Michael Kerrisk  [Aurelien Jarno, Török Edwin]
        Explain why strcasecmp()+strncasecmp() are also declared in <string.h>
            See http://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=729436

strcpy.3
    Michael Kerrisk
        NOTES: Add a subheading

fd.4
    Michael Kerrisk  [Sam Varshavchik]
        Fix floppy disk device names
            The naming convention shown in the page was ancient.
            Now, the page is consistent with Documentation/devices.txt
            (where it is noted that "The use of the capital letters
            D, H and E for the 3.5" models have been deprecated, since
            the drive type is insignificant for these devices"

proc.5
    Michael Kerrisk
        Document /proc/timer_stats
    Michael Kerrisk
        (Briefly) document /proc/timer_list
    Michael Kerrisk
        Add /proc/sys/kernel/{sched_rt_period_us,sched_rt_runtime_us}
            Reference sched(7) for an explanation of these two files

capabilities.7
    Michael Kerrisk
        Mention sched_setattr(2) under CAP_SYS_NICE

cpuset.7
    Michael Kerrisk
        SEE ALSO: add sched(7)

credentials.7
    Michael Kerrisk
        Mention sched_getattr() as a place where credentials are checked

fanotify.7
    Heinrich Schuchardt  [Jan Kara]
        BUGS: error events can be lost when reading from fanotify FD
    Michael Kerrisk  [Heinrich Schuchardt]
        Fix description of FAN_EVENT_NEXT()
            FAN_EVENT_NEXT() does not update 'meta'; rather, it returns a
            pointer to the next metadata structure. In addition, generally
            rework the description to be a bit clearer and more detailed.
    Heinrich Schuchardt
        Document FAN_EVENT_METADATA_LEN

ip.7
    Michael Kerrisk
        Note cases where an ephemeral port is used
    Michael Kerrisk
        Remove BUGS text on glibc failing to declare in_pktinfo
    Michael Kerrisk
        Clarify 'ip_local_port_range' and mention the term "ephemeral ports"
    Michael Kerrisk
        Note some more details about assignment of ephemeral ports
    Michael Kerrisk
        BUGS: ephemeral port range exhaustion is diagnosed inconsistently
            Different system calls use different 'errno' values to diagnose
            exhaustion of the ephemeral port range.

sched.7
    Michael Kerrisk
        Document sched_rt_period_us and sched_rt_runtime_us /proc files
            And rework and relocate the text on dealing with runaway
            real-time processes.
    Michael Kerrisk
        Mention sched_setattr(2) in list of APIs that can change policies
    Michael Kerrisk
        sched_setattr(2) can also be used to set 'nice' value
    Michael Kerrisk
        Remove mention of sched_setscheduler() when talking about sched_priority
            There are nowadays multiple ways to set sched_priority (and
            in fact there always were, since we also had sched_setparam(2)).
    Michael Kerrisk
        SEE ALSO: Add Documentation/scheduler/sched-design-CFS.txt
    Michael Kerrisk
        Don't mention sched_setscheduler(2) in discussions of setting policies
            In a couple of places, sched_setscheduler(2) is mentioned as the
            way of setting policies. But now there is sched_setattr(2) as
            well, rewrite the text in a more generic way.
    Michael Kerrisk
        Rework summary text describing sched_setattr(2) and sched_getattr(2)
            Note that these APIs are a superset of sched_setscheduler(2)
            and sched_getscheduler(2).
    Michael Kerrisk
        Remove crufty text relating to sched_setscheduler()
            All of the removed text is in sched_setscheduler(2) and
            should have been trimmed from this page.
    Michael Kerrisk
        SEE ALSO: Mention more files in Documentation/scheduler/ directory

New and rewritten pages
-----------------------

localedef.1
    Marko Myllynen, Richard Braakman, Alastair McKinstry, Lars Wirzenius
        New page for localedef(1)
            Add new page based on Debian localedef(1) page.


New and changed links
---------------------

procfs.5
    New link to proc.5
        Since the term "procfs" is widely used, it seems reasonable to have
        a link from that name to proc(5).


Changes to individual pages
---------------------------

locale.1
    Marko Myllynen
        Provide a step-by-step example of how to use a custom locale
    Marko Myllynen
        Use LC_TELEPHONE instead of LC_MESSAGES in the example
            yesstr/nostr in LC_MESSAGES are planned to be changed at some
            point [1], so it's better to provide an example which won't
            be obsoleted by that change.

            [1] https://sourceware.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=16975

adjtimex.2
    Michael Kerrisk
        Add feature test macro requirements

clone.2
    Michael Kerrisk
        ERRORS: add cross-reference to fork(2) for explanation of EAGAIN

fork.2
    Michael Kerrisk
        ERRORS: add pid_max and threads-max to EAGAIN
            And rewrite text to be the same as pthread_create(3).

getrlimit.2
    Michael Kerrisk
        RLIMIT_NPROC is not enforced if CAP_SYS_ADMIN or CAP_SYS_RESOURCE

remap_file_pages.2
    Rasmus Villemoes
        Fix prototype
            The pgoff argument has type size_t, not ssize_t (and in the
            kernel it is unsigned long).

set_mempolicy.2
    Rasmus Villemoes
        Fix prototype for set_mempolicy(2)
            The nodemask argument is const. The return type in numaif.h is long.

swapon.2
    Rasmus Villemoes
        Remove header from synopsis
            The <asm/page.h> header is not readily available, and the comment
            seems to indicate that it is for getting PAGE_SIZE. But it is
            never mentioned why one would need to know that, and it is in any
            case better obtained using sysconf(), provided by <unistd.h>.

a64l.3
    Rasmus Villemoes
        Fix prototype for a64l()
            The argument is const, both according to POSIX and the
            glibc headers.

adjtime.3
    Rasmus Villemoes
        Add required header
            The prototype for adjtime(3) is declared in <sys/time.h>.

argz_add.3
    Rasmus Villemoes
        Fix prototypes
            Update the prototypes of argz_{delete,extract,next} to agree with
            glibc headers and manual.

bstring.3
    Rasmus Villemoes
        Fix prototypes
            The length parameter n has type size_t in bcmp(), bcopy() and
            bzero().

envz_add.3
    Rasmus Villemoes
        Fix prototypes
            The envz_len parameters for envz_entry() and envz_get() are not
            passed by reference.

fpathconf.3
    Rasmus Villemoes
        Fix prototype
            The path argument to pathconf() is const.

fseek.3
    Rasmus Villemoes
        Fix prototype
            The pos argument to fsetpos() is const.

gcvt.3
    Rasmus Villemoes
        Fix prototype
            The ndigit parameter to gcvt() has type int.

getaddrinfo_a.3
    Rasmus Villemoes
        Fix prototype
            The pointer arguments to gai_suspend() are const.

getauxval.3
    Rasmus Villemoes
        Fix permissions
            There doesn't seem to be any reason for getauxval.3 to be
            executable...

getnameinfo.3
    Rasmus Villemoes
        Fix prototype
            The hostlen and servlen parameters have type socklen_t.
            (The types changed in glibc 2.2)
    Michael Kerrisk
        Note types of 'hostlen'; and 'servlen' in glibc < 2.2

getrpcent.3
    Rasmus Villemoes
        Fix prototype
            The argument to getrpcbyname() is const.

getrpcport.3
    Rasmus Villemoes
        Add #include and fix prototype
            The prototype for getrpcport() is obtained by #include'ing
            <rpc/rpc.h>. Also, update its prototype.

getspnam.3
    Rasmus Villemoes
        Fix prototype
            The struct spwd argument to putspent() is const.

getutent.3
    Rasmus Villemoes
        Fix prototypes
            The arguments to getutid(), getutline(), and pututline()
            are const.

inet.3
    Rasmus Villemoes

            The parameters to inet_makeaddr have type in_addr_t.

inet_net_pton.3
    Rasmus Villemoes
        srcfix, cfix
            Use a consistent style throughout the man-pages.

key_setsecret.3
    Rasmus Villemoes
        Fix prototypes
            Remove const qualifiers from arguments to key_decryptsession,
            key_encryptsession, and key_setsecret.

makecontext.3
    Rasmus Villemoes
        Fix prototype
            The second argument to swapcontext() is const.

makedev.3
    Rasmus Villemoes
        Fix prototype
            gnu_dev_makedev, and hence its trivial macro wrapper makedev, takes
            two unsigned int parameters; this is consistent with it being the
            inverse of (gnu_dev_)major/minor, which return unsigned int.

malloc_trim.3
    Rasmus Villemoes
        Fix prototype
            As mentioned further down, malloc_trim returns an integer.

mq_getattr.3
    Rasmus Villemoes
        Fix prototype
            The newattr parameter to mq_setattr is const.

newlocale.3
    Marko Myllynen
        List all available category masks
    Michael Kerrisk
        Add LC_ALL_MASK description

nl_langinfo.3
    Marko Myllynen

            Better illustrate querying elements from different categories.

perror.3
    Rasmus Villemoes
        Fix declaration
            The elements of the array sys_errlist are also const.

pthread_attr_setaffinity_np.3
pthread_attr_setdetachstate.3
pthread_attr_setguardsize.3
pthread_attr_setinheritsched.3
pthread_attr_setschedparam.3
pthread_attr_setschedpolicy.3
pthread_attr_setscope.3
pthread_attr_setstack.3
pthread_attr_setstackaddr.3
pthread_attr_setstacksize.3
    Rasmus Villemoes
        Constify parameters
            Each of the pthread_attr_get* functions extract some piece of
            information from a pthread_attr_t, which is passed by const
            reference. Add the const keyword to the prototypes of these
            functions.

pthread_cleanup_push_defer_np.3
    Michael Kerrisk  [Rasmus Villemoes]
        Add feature test macro requirements

pthread_create.3
    Michael Kerrisk  [Carsten Grohmann]
        Add pid_max limit to EAGAIN error cases

pthread_equal.3
    Peng Haitao
        ATTRIBUTES: Note function that is thread-safe
            The function pthread_equal() is thread safe.

pthread_exit.3
    Peng Haitao
        ATTRIBUTES: Note function that is thread-safe
            The function pthread_exit() is thread safe.

pthread_getcpuclockid.3
    Peng Haitao
        ATTRIBUTES: Note function that is thread-safe
            The function pthread_getcpuclockid() is thread safe.

pthread_setaffinity_np.3
    Peng Haitao
        ATTRIBUTES: Note functions that are thread-safe
            The functions pthread_setaffinity_np() and
            pthread_getaffinity_np() are thread safe.

pthread_setconcurrency.3
    Peng Haitao
        ATTRIBUTES: Note functions that are thread-safe
            The functions pthread_setconcurrency() and
            pthread_getconcurrency() are thread safe.

pthread_setname_np.3
    Rasmus Villemoes
        Fix prototype
            The name parameter of pthread_getname_np is an output parameter and
            hence not const.

pthread_setschedparam.3
    Rasmus Villemoes
        Fix prototypes
            Add return type for pthread_{s,g}etschedparam.

pthread_setschedprio.3
    Rasmus Villemoes
        Fix prototype
            Add return type for pthread_setschedprio.

pthread_sigqueue.3
    Rasmus Villemoes
        Add missing #include <signal.h>

rcmd.3
    Rasmus Villemoes
        Fix prototypes
            Unlike the BSDs, the second argument of rcmd() and rcmd_af() has
            type unsigned short.
            The first argument of iruserok_af() has type const void*.

re_comp.3
    Rasmus Villemoes
        Fix prototypes
            re_comp and re_exec take const char* arguments.

resolver.3
    Rasmus Villemoes
        Fix prototypes and extern-declaration
            Fix const- and signedness of various char* parameters.

            Also, there is no "struct state", but _res is a struct
            __res_state. (Actually, _res is errno-like in that it is really a
            macro expanding to (*__res_state()).)

rexec.3
    Rasmus Villemoes
        Fix prototypes
            The user, passwd and cmd arguments to rexec and rexec_af are all
            const.

rtime.3
    Rasmus Villemoes
        Replace header
            The header <rpc/des_crypt.h> does not provide rtime();
            <rpc/auth_des.h> does, as is also implied in both the NOTES and
            EXAMPLE sections.

scandir.3
    Rasmus Villemoes
        Fix prototypes
            The alphasort and versionsort functions take arguments of type
            const struct dirent **, not const void *.

setlocale.3
    Michael Kerrisk  [Marko Myllynen]
        Simplify locale category listing and add GNU-specific locale categories
            Some information that was here will move to locale(7).
    Marko Myllynen
        Remove now obsolete NOTES section

setnetgrent.3
    Rasmus Villemoes
        Fix prototype
            The buflen argument to getnetgrent_r has type size_t.

sigvec.3
    Rasmus Villemoes
        Fix prototype
            The vec argument to sigvec is const.

tsearch.3
    Rasmus Villemoes
        Fix prototype
            The rootp argument to tfind is "void * const *",
            not "const void **".

core.5
    Michael Kerrisk
        Core dump files are nowadays core.pid by default

locale.5
    Marko Myllynen
        Document mon_grouping and grouping properly
    Michael Kerrisk
        Note default value for 'first_workday'
    Michael Kerrisk  [Marko Myllynen]
        Add brief descriptions of collating-element and collating-symbol
    Marko Myllynen
        t_fmt_ampm is needed only for locales that employ AM/PM convention
    Michael Kerrisk  [Marko Myllynen]
        Remove crufty reference to /usr/lib/nls/src
            That file is nowhere to be found
    Marko Myllynen
        Clarify LC_TIME/am_pm and LC_NAME keywords usage
            am_pm should be defined only if AM/PM convention is used to signal
            applications they should not try to print them when using them in
            unwanted.

            Same for all LC_NAME keywords expect for name_fmt which should be
            always defined.
    Marko Myllynen
        Clarify lang_term / lang_lib
            As noted by Keld Simonsen in the lib-locales@sourceware mailing
            list:

                https://sourceware.org/ml/libc-locales/2014-q2/msg00008.html
                From: Keld Simonsen <keld at rap dot rap dot dk>
                To: Marko Myllynen <myllynen at redhat dot com>
                Date: Tue, 29 Apr 2014 17:02:09 +0200

                lang_term reflects ISO 639-2/T (terminology) codes, while
                lang_lib reflects ISO 639-2/B (bibliographic) codes.
                lang_term is preferred over lang_lib codes for locale names.
                There are 20 specific ISO 639-2/B codes.
    Marko Myllynen
        Correct the FILES section

proc.5
    Michael Kerrisk
        'pid_max' is a system-wide limit on number of threads and processes
            Since PIDs > /proc/sys/kernel/pid_max are not allocated, this
            file thus also imposes a system-wide limit on the number of
            threads and processes.

capabilities.7
    Michael Kerrisk
        CAP_SYS_ADMIN allows overriding RLIMIT_NPROC
    Michael Kerrisk
        CAP_SYS_PTRACE allows process_vm_readv(2) and process_vm_writev(2)

charsets.7
    Michael Kerrisk  [Marko Myllynen]
        Remove crufty statement that Romanian may be switching to ISO 8859-16
    Michael Kerrisk
        Remove ancient paragraph on charsets supported in glibc 2.3.2
            That test is rather ancient, and probably of little use.

fanotify.7
    Heinrich Schuchardt
        Fix to example program: fanotify read() should use aligned buffer

inotify.7
    Heinrich Schuchardt
        Add example program
            This example of the usage of the inotify API shows the
            usage of inotify_init1(2) and inotify_add_watch(2) as well
            as polling and reading from the inotify file descriptor.
    Heinrich Schuchardt
        munmap() does not generate inotify events

locale.7
    Marko Myllynen [Michael Kerrisk]
        Document the LOCPATH environment variable
    Michael Kerrisk
        Add further details on various categories

    Marko Myllynen
        Clarify AM/PM settings a bit
            localedef(1) complains if really undefined, should be empty instead.

Changes to individual pages
---------------------------

iconv.1
iconvconfig.8
    Marko Myllynen
        Clarify gconv file terminology a bit

ldd.1
    Michael Kerrisk
        SEE ALSO: add sprof(1)

connect.2
    Michael Kerrisk
        ERRORS: add EPROTOTYPE
            See https://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=708394

dup.2
    Michael Kerrisk  [Rich Felker]
        Fix erroneous discussion regarding closing 'newfd' before calling dup2()
            And propose a workaround if the caller cares about catching
            close() time errors.

            See http://stackoverflow.com/questions/23440216/race-condition-when-using-dup2#comment36888604_23444465
            and http://austingroupbugs.net/view.php?id=411
    Michael Kerrisk
        Rework and enhance discussion of dup2()
            In particular, note that dup2() performs the steps of closing
            and reusing 'newfd' atomically.
    Michael Kerrisk
        Add subhead for dup3()

epoll_ctl.2
    Michael Kerrisk
        BUGS: EPOLLWAKEUP is silently ignored without CAP_BLOCK_SUSPEND
            If the caller does not have CAP_BLOCK_SUSPEND, then EPOLLWAKEUP
            is silently ignored.

fcntl.2
    Michael Kerrisk  [Tomi Salminen]
        The return value for F_SETPIPE_SZ is the pipe capacity
    Michael Kerrisk
        ERRORS: Document ENOTDIR error for F_NOTIFY

    Michael Kerrisk
        Suggest the use of real-time signals with F_NOTIFY

getitimer.2
    Michael Kerrisk
        Rewrite a few pieces to clarify some details

inotify_add_watch.2
    Michael Kerrisk
        Clarify that the target of a watch is an i-node
            The target of a watch is an i-node, not a pathname. Clarify
            the text to prevent the reader possibly misunderstanding
            that establishing watches by two different links to the same
            file might create different watch descriptors.

open.2
    Michael Kerrisk  [Кирилл]
        O_CLOEXEC is also one the flags not ignored when O_PATH is specified

pipe.2
    Elie De Brauwer
        PIPE_BUF is defined in limits.h
            To make use of PIPE_BUF in an application one should include
            <limits.h>.  Adding a reference to this inclusion.

poll.2
    Michael Kerrisk  [Nadav Har'El]
        The negate-fd-to-ignore technique does not work for file descriptor 0
            See https://bugzilla.kernel.org/show_bug.cgi?id=79411

set_tid_address.2
    Michael Kerrisk  [Rich Felker]
        Use "thread" rather than "process" in DESCRIPTION
    Michael Kerrisk
        SEE ALSO: add gettid(2)

shmop.2
    Michael Kerrisk
        Explain SHMLBA in much more detail

splice.2
    Michael Kerrisk
        Document EAGAIN error
            See https://bugzilla.kernel.org/show_bug.cgi?id=48641

syscalls.2
    Carlos O'Donell
        Add prlimit64(2)
            While trying to reconcile the new features in glibc with the
            documented entries in the linux kernel man pages I noticed that
            glibc exports prlimit64 for use by 32-bit applications (as does
            the linux kernel), but that prlimit64 was not defined in the
            syscalls list or in the prlimit-related page.

            This is not the complete fix for this, but I don't have the time
            to explain why and when prlimit64 should be used (or how it should
            be used safely). Therefore I'm just patching the syscalls.2 list
            to show that prlimit64 exists and was added in 2.6.36 (verified
            with git by checking out the tags before and after).

syslog.2
    Michael Kerrisk
        Rework introductory paragraph
    Michael Kerrisk  [Robert P. J. Day]
        Rework text describing loglevels
            The kernel header file mentioned in the discussion of the KERN_*
            constants has morphed and is no longer exported inside glibc.
            And the definitions of the constants themselves changed subtly
            with kernel commit 04d2c8c83d0e3ac5f78aeede51babb3236200112.
            So, rewrite the description of the constants to be a bit more
            abstract.
    Michael Kerrisk
        Rewrite parts of the page, and import /proc/sys/kernel/printk
            * Move /proc/sys/kernel/printk from proc(5) to this page,
              and correct various details in the discussion of that file.
            * Rewrite and correct various other details on the page.
            * Clean out some crufty text.
            * Miscellaneous minor fixes.
    Michael Kerrisk
        Update SYSLOG_ACTION_CONSOLE_OFF + SYSLOG_ACTION_CONSOLE_ON description
            Details changed in Linux 2.6.32

tee.2

    Michael Kerrisk
        Make description of ether_line() bug a little more informative

mallopt.3
    Michael Kerrisk  [Florian Weimer]
        MALLOC_MMAP_THRESHOLD_ and MALLOC_MMAP_MAX_ *do* work in setgid programs
            My testing on this point was bogus, overlooking details of
            strace(1)'s behavior with setuid programs.

            See https://sourceware.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=12155

printf.3
    Michael Kerrisk  [Rich Felker]
        Remove libc4 and libc5 details
            Rich Felker noted that "scare text" in the man page warned about
            the use of snprintf() on libc, and that some people had cited
            this as a reason not to use snprintf().  Linux libc is now
            ancient history, so there is no real need to keep that text.
            But, while we're at it, we may as well clear out all of the
            other ancient libc4 and libc5 pieces in the page. They are
            nowadays more clutter than help.
    Michael Kerrisk
        SUSv3 and later agree with C99 for the snprintf() return value
            Determined by inspection of the SUSv3 and SUSv4 specifications.
    Michael Kerrisk
        Remove some old text about glibc 2.0 changes
            We probably don't now need such ancient info.
    Michael Kerrisk
        Update references to standards for C and S conversion specifiers

charmap.5
    Marko Myllynen
        Various minor updates and improvements
            - more precise title
            - extend description a bit
            - document previously omitted WIDTH_DEFAULT
    Marko Myllynen
        Remove accidental ISO C compliance reference
            glibc refers in locale/programs/charmap.c to ISO C 99 section
            7.17.(2) and ISO C 99 section 5.2.1.(3) that if a character map
            is not ASCII compatible then the locale using it is not ISO C
            compliant. This does not state anything about the character set
            itself.

proc.5
    Michael Kerrisk
        Replace /proc/sys/kernel/printk discussion with reference to syslog(2)
            It makes more sense to have the /proc/sys/kernel/printk with
            the related material in syslog(2).
    Michael Kerrisk
        Rewrite /proc/sys/kernel/printk description

inotify.7
    Michael Kerrisk
        Clarify which events are generated for watched directories
            Really, with respect to watched directories, events fall into
            three classes (not two, as was shown):

            * Events that can be generated only for the watched directory.
            * Events that can be generated only for objects that are inside
              the watched directory.
            * Events that can be generated both for the watched directory
              and for objects inside the directory.

            So, mark these three classes more clearly in the list of inotify
            events.
    Heinrich Schuchardt  [Michael Kerrisk]
        BUGS: Note possible bug triggered by watch descriptor reuse
            Watch descriptor IDs are returned by inotify_add_watch().
            When calling inotify_rm_watch() an IN_IGNORED is placed on the
            inotify queue pointing to the ID of the removed watch.

            inotify_add_watch() should not return a watch descriptor ID for
            which events are still on the queue but should return an
            unused ID.

            Unfortunately, the existing Kernel code does not provide such a
            guarantee.

            Actually, in rare cases watch descriptor IDs are returned by
            inotify_add_watch() for which events are still on the inotify
            queue.

            See https://bugzilla.kernel.org/show_bug.cgi?id=77111
    Michael Kerrisk
        Add further detail to the watch descriptor reuse bug
            As well as inotify_rm_watch(), file deletion and unmounting a
            filesystem can also cause a watch descriptor to be deleted.
    Michael Kerrisk
        The watch descriptor reuse bug may be hard to hit in practice
            Explain the circumstances in detail, indicating that the
            bug may be very unlikely to occur in practice.
    Michael Kerrisk
        Clarify description of IN_EXCL_UNLINK
            Clarify the text a little, in particular making it clearer
            that the target of a watch is an i-node (not a pathname).
    Michael Kerrisk
        Clarify IN_ONESHOT explanation
            Make it clearer that the target of monitoring is an i-node,
            not a pathname.
    Michael Kerrisk
        Make comment on 'mask' field more accurate

libc.7
    Michael Kerrisk
        Clarify man-pages policy on documenting C libraries other than glibc
    Michael Kerrisk
        Use absolute dates in discussion of libc vs glibc

pipe.7
    Elie De Brauwer
        Add reference that the pipe capacity can be changed
            In fcntl(2) F_SETPIPE_SZ, F_GETPIPE_SZ and
            /proc/sys/fs/pipe-max-size are defined, however
            pipe(7) still defines the pipe capacity as being
            a static entity. Adding a reference to fcntl(2).
    Michael Kerrisk  [Walter Harms]
        Clarify that since 2.6.35, 65535 bytes is the default pipe capacity

ld.so.8
    Michael Kerrisk
        Clarify that LD_PROFILE can specify just a single shared object
    Michael Kerrisk
        Clarify that LD_PROFILE output is appended to target file
            The LD_PROFILE output is appended to any existing
            contents of the target file.

Changes to individual pages
---------------------------

access.2
    Michael Kerrisk
        Glibc falls back to using access() on kernels that lack faccessat()

bdflush.2
fsync.2
sync.2
proc.5
    Adrian Bunk
        Change "sync(1)" to "sync(8)"

bind.2
    Michael Kerrisk  [Ryan Hammonds]
        Correct EINVAL error description
            As pointed out by Ryan:

                My application is trying to bind an IPv4 UDP socket to an
                address. I've found that passing an invalid address length
                to bind() causes bind to return EINVAL. According to the
                bind(2) manpage, this should only occur when using unix
                domain sockets (which I am not).

chmod.2
    Michael Kerrisk
        Glibc falls back to chmod() on kernels that don't support fchmodat()
    Michael Kerrisk
        Glibc falls back to chown()/lchown() on kernels that lack fchownat()

epoll_wait.2
    Michael Kerrisk
        NOTES: describe raw epoll_pwait() system call differences

getgroups.2
    Michael Kerrisk
        SEE ALSO: add group_member(3)

getpriority.2
    Michael Kerrisk
        Enhance discussion of kernel nice range versus user-space nice range
    Michael Kerrisk
        Move text describing nice range on other systems

getrlimit.2
    Michael Kerrisk
        Add cross reference to core(5) in discussion of RLIMIT_CORE
    Michael Kerrisk
        Describe the "large" resource limit bug on 32-bit platforms
            See https://bugzilla.kernel.org/show_bug.cgi?id=5042.
    Michael Kerrisk
        Glibc's setrlimit() and getrlimit() are implemented using prlimit()

kexec_load.2
    Michael Kerrisk
        Note limit of 16 for 'nr_segments'
    Michael Kerrisk
        Clarify the 'flags' bits that contain the architecture
    Michael Kerrisk
        Add KEXEC_ARCH_68K to list of architectures for 'flags'
    Michael Kerrisk
        Reword description of 'flags' a little

link.2
    Michael Kerrisk
        Glibc falls back to link() on kernels that lack linkat()
            Unless 'flags' contains AT_SYMLINK_FOLLOW.

mkdir.2
    Michael Kerrisk
        Glibc falls back to mkdir() on kernels that don't support mkdirat()

perf_event_open.2
    Vince Weaver
        Clarify PERF_SAMPLE_STACK_USER usage
            This clarifies the PERF_SAMPLE_STACK_USER section.
            I found these issue while implementing some code that uses
            the option.  The important change is fixing the name of the
            sample_stack_user parameter, the rest is just some wording
            fixes and minor clarifications.
    Vince Weaver
        Clarify PERF_SAMPLE_DATA_SRC usage
            When checking the fields in the PERF_SAMPLE_DATA_SRC type samples
            you need to shift the masks before doing the compare.

            Although the value you are checking (perf_mem_data_src) is
            specified as a bitfield so this might all fall apart if trying
            to access the field in a cross-endian way.  The Power people
            were working on this issue, not sure if they resolved it.

poll.2
    Michael Kerrisk
        Describe fifth argument (sigsetsize) of raw ppoll() system call

process_vm_readv.2
    Michael Kerrisk  [Ville Ylenius]
        Fix typo in example program

    Michael Kerrisk
        Glibc falls back to readlink() on kernels that lack readlinkat()

recv.2
    Michael Kerrisk
        'addrlen' should be NULL (not 0) if we don't need sender address

rename.2
    Michael Kerrisk
        Glibc falls back to rename() when the kernel doesn't have renameat()

sigwaitinfo.2
    Michael Kerrisk
        The raw sigtimedwait() system call has a fifth argument

symlink.2
    Michael Kerrisk
        Glibc falls back to symlink() on kernels that lack symlinkat()

sysinfo.2
    Michael Kerrisk
        Add VERSIONS section

unlink.2
    Michael Kerrisk
        Glibc falls back to unlink() or rmdir() on kernels that lack unlinkat()

atoi.3
    Michael Kerrisk
        Downgrade discussion of atoq()
            Remove most references to atoq() in this page, since this function
            was present only in Linux libc (not glibc).

    Michael Kerrisk  [Jakub Wilk]
        Note use of 'j', 'z', and 't' length modifiers for '%n'
            See http://bugs.debian.org/756602
    Michael Kerrisk

setbuf.3
    Michael Kerrisk
        Remove ancient Linux libc and 4.x BSD details

strstr.3
    Michael Kerrisk
        Remove discussion of Linux libc bugs
            Linux libc is old enough that we needn't care any longer.

strtod.3
    Michael Kerrisk
        Explain NAN(n-char-sequence)

strtod.3
    Michael Kerrisk
        SEE ALSO: add nan(3), nanf(3), NANL(3)

Changes to individual pages
---------------------------

connect.2
    Michael Haardt
        Note that a new socket should be used if connect() fails

fcntl.2
    Michael Kerrisk
        One must define _GNU_SOURCE to get the F_OFD_* definitions

poll.2, select.2
    Rusty Russell
        Fix erroneous description of "available for write".
            POSIX says: "POLLOUT Normal data may be written without
            blocking.".  This "may" is misleading, see the POSIX
            write page:

                Write requests to a pipe or FIFO shall be handled in the
                same way as a regular file with the following exceptions:
                ...
                If the O_NONBLOCK flag is clear, a write request may cause
                the thread to block, but on normal completion it shall
                return nbyte.
                ...
                When attempting to write to a file descriptor (other than a
                pipe or FIFO) that supports non-blocking writes and cannot
                accept the data immediately:

                If the O_NONBLOCK flag is clear, write() shall block the
                calling thread until the data can be accepted.

                If the O_NONBLOCK flag is set, write() shall not block the
                thread. If some data can be written without blocking the
                thread, write() shall write what it can and return the
                number of bytes written. Otherwise, it shall return -1 and
                set errno to [EAGAIN].

            The net result is that write() of more than 1 byte on a
            socket, pipe or FIFO which is "ready" may block: write()
            (unlike read!) will attempt to write the entire buffer and
            only return a short write under exceptional circumstances.

            Indeed, this is the behaviour we see in Linux:

        IN_OPEN and IN_CLOSE_NOWRITE can also occur for directories
    Michael Kerrisk
        IN_CLOSE_WRITE occurs only for files (not monitored directory)
    Michael Kerrisk

packet.7
    Sorin Dumitru
        Fix include file
            It looks like most of the socket options from this man pages
            are not defined in <netpacket/packet.h>. They are defined in
            <linux/if_packet.h> so we should include that one.

                      Serge Hallyn]
        New page describing PID namespaces

user_namespaces.7
    Michael Kerrisk  [Eric W. Biederman, Andy Lutomirski, Serge Hallyn]

    Michael Kerrisk
        Move some CLONE_NEWUTS text 2 to namespaces.7

flock.2
    Michael Kerrisk  [J. Bruce Fields]
        Don't mention "classical BSD" in discussion of fcntl()/flock interaction
            The noninteraction of flock(2) and fcntl(2) locks does
            not seem to be classical BSD semantics (at least, checking
            the 4.4BSD sources suggest that the lock types do interact,
            although there have been other systems also where fcntl()
            and flock() locks do not interact). So, fix the text
            discussing "classical BSD" lock semantics.

            s/size of unwind table/size of the unwind data/

        Clarify capabilities required for reassociating with a mount namespace
    Michael Kerrisk
        Specify kernel version on each CLONE_NEW* flag
            And remove text on flags from VERSIONS.

unshare.2
    Michael Kerrisk
        Add an example program
    Michael Kerrisk
        Clarify semantics of CLONE_SYSVSEM
    Michael Kerrisk
        CLONE_SYSVSEM does not require CAP_SYS_ADMIN
    Michael Kerrisk
        Note flags implied by CLONE_THREAD and CLONE_VM

clock.3
    Michael Kerrisk  [Vincent Lefevre]
        The implementation uses clock_gettime() was to improve *accuracy*
            (The man page text mistakenly used the word "precision".)

drand48.3
    Michael Kerrisk  [Lorenzo Beretta]

    Michael Kerrisk
        Document CAP_SETUID and CAP_SETGID for user namespace mappings
    Michael Kerrisk
        setns() needs CAP_SYS_ADMIN in the *target* namespace
    Michael Kerrisk
        Since Linux 3.8, user namespaces no longer require CAP_SYS_ADMIN

mq_overview.7
    Michael Kerrisk
        Refer to namespaces(7) for info on POSIX MQs and IPC namespaces

svipc.7
    Michael Kerrisk
        Refer to namespaces(7) for info on System V IPC and IPC namespaces

            This and [the related *.7] patches will provide unification of
            charset pages, minor cleanups, and some unifying cosmetic
            changes. References are adjusted so that all pages include
            a reference to charsets(7), which contains a description of
            these sets, stray comments are removed, some obsolete
            statements (like ISO 8859-1 being the de-facto ASCII
            replacement) are removed, and some minor reformatting
            to minimize diff's between the pages are done.

            The actual substance, the character tables, remain unchanged.

            This series changes the following pages (under man7): ascii,
            armscii, cp1251, koi8-r, koi8-u, and all of iso_8859-*.

        Regular files and directories can't be monitored with epoll_ctl()

ioctl.2
    Heinrich Schuchardt
        Rename 'd' argument to 'fd' in text
            In most other manpages file descriptors are called 'fd'.
            This patches renames attribute 'd' to 'fd'.

madvise.2
    Michael Kerrisk
        VERSIONS: Support for madvise() is now configurable
            Support for this system call now depends on the
            CONFIG_ADVISE_SYSCALLS configuration option.

open.2
    Michael Kerrisk
        Enhance rationale discussion for openat() and friends

posix_fadvise.2
    Mel Gorman
        Document the behavior of partial page discard requests
            It is not obvious from the interface that "partial page discard"
            requests are ignored. It should be spelled out.
    Michael Kerrisk  [Weijie Yang]
        ERRORS: Since 2.6.16, the kernel correctly deals with the ESPIPE case
    Michael Kerrisk
        Support for fadvise64() is now configurable
            Support for this system call now depends on the
            CONFIG_ADVISE_SYSCALLS configuration option.

prctl.2
    Andreas Schwab
        Correct description of null-termination in PR_GET_NAME and PR_SET_NAME
            The size of the process name has always been at most 16 byte
            _including_ the null terminator.  This also means that the
            name returned by PR_GET_NAME is always null-terminated.
    Michael Kerrisk
        PR_SET_NAME silently truncates strings that exceed 16 bytes

restart_syscall.2
    Michael Kerrisk
        Add some text explaining why restart_syscall() exists

sched_setaffinity.2
    Michael Kerrisk
        NOTES: Add paragraph on how to discover set of CPUs available on system
    Michael Kerrisk
        SEE ALSO: add nproc(1) and lscpu(1)

select.2
    Michael Kerrisk
        SEE ALSO: add restart_syscall(2)

semop.2
    Michael Kerrisk

    Michael Kerrisk
        Remove information about semtimedop() EAGAIN that is repeated elsewhere
    Michael Kerrisk
        Add subsection head for semtimedop()

setsid.2
    Michael Kerrisk
        Rewrite some pieces and add some details
            Among other changes, add an explanation of why setsid() can't
            be called from a process group leader

sgetmask.2
    Michael Kerrisk
        Since 3.16, support for these system calls is configurable
            Support for these calls is now dependent on the setting of the
            CONFIG_SGETMASK_SYSCALL option.

sigaction.2
    Michael Kerrisk
        Document SA_RESTORER
    Michael Kerrisk
        Add some detail on the sa_restorer field
    Michael Kerrisk
        SEE ALSO: add sigreturn(2)

splice.2
    Michael Kerrisk
        Reformat description of 'fd_in' and 'off_in' to improve readability

syscall.2
    Michael Kerrisk
        SEE ALSO: add errno(3)

syscalls.2
    Michael Kerrisk
        SEE ALSO: add errno(3)
    Michael Kerrisk
        3.19 adds execveat()
    Michael Kerrisk
        Add bpf(2) to list

tee.2
    Michael Kerrisk
        Add shell session demonstrating use of the example program

tkill.2
    Michael Kerrisk  [Rich Felker]
        Remove bogus text saying tgid==-1 makes tgkill() equivalent to tkill()

abort.3
    Michael Kerrisk
        Note that SIGABRT is raised as though raise(3) is called
            Also note that abort() is POSIX.1-2008 compliant.

cmsg.3
    David Wragg
        Ensure buf is suitably aligned in sending example
            Inspection of the definition of CMSG_FIRSTHDR (both in glibc and
            the suggested definition in RFC3542) shows that it yields the
            msg_control field.  So when sending, the pointer placed in
            msg_control should be suitably aligned as a struct cmsghdr.
            In the sending example, buf was declared as a bare char array,
            and so is not necessarily suitably aligned.

            The solution here involves placing buf inside a union, and is
            based on the sockets/scm_rights_send.c sample from The Linux
            Programming Interface "dist" source code collection.

exp10.3
    Michael Kerrisk
        Before glibc 2.19, exp() did not give ERANGE error on underflow
            http://sources.redhat.com/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=6787

ftw.3
    Michael Kerrisk
        FTW_CHDIR has no effect on the 'fpath' argument passed to fn()

getopt.3
    Michael Kerrisk  [Jonny Grant]
        Ensure that 'nsecs' is used

ilogb.3
    Michael Kerrisk  [Will Newton]
        Since glibc 2.16, ilogb() does correctly diagnose domain errors

memcmp.3
    Michael Haardt
        Document return value for n==0 case
    Michael Haardt
        Warn against use of memcmp() for comparing security-critical data

mq_open.3
    Michael Kerrisk
        Document the O_CLOEXEC flag
    Michael Kerrisk
        Place 'flags' constants in alphabetical order

pow.3
    Manuel López-Ibáñez
        Add note on performance characteristics of pow()

pthread_setschedparam.3
    Simon Newton
        Fix logic error in example program
            The example program will crash if -A is used, since 'attr'
            is uninitialized.

                $ ./a.out  -A
                *** Error in `./a.out': free(): invalid pointer: 0xb779c3c4 ***
                Aborted (core dumped)
    刘湃
        Small fixes to example program

sigvec.3
    Michael Kerrisk
        Starting with version 2.21, glibc no longer exports sigvec()

sysconf.3
    Josh Triplett
        Document _SC_NGROUPS_MAX
            Already documented in getgroups(2), but not in sysconf(3).

termios.3
    Michael Kerrisk
        SEE ALSO: add tset(1)

tgamma.3
    Michael Kerrisk
        Since glibc 2.18, errno is correctly set to EDOM when (x == -infinity))

wordexp.3
    Carlos O'Donell
        Make it clear that WRDE_NOCMD prevents command substitution
            The use of WRDE_NOCMD prevents command substitution. If the flag
            WRDE_NOCMD is set then no command substitution shall occur and
            the error WRDE_CMDSUB will be returned if such substitution is
            requested when processing the words.

            The manual page as-is makes it seem like the command substitution
            occurs, and an error is returned *after* the substitution.
            This patch clarifies that.

locale.5
    Marko Myllynen
        Describe the formats of values
            locale(5) describes what a locale should define but doesn't
            spell out how (in what format). The patch attempts to address
            this, it also has few trivial additional enhancements.

            * Reference to locale(7) for category descriptions.
            * Clarify first_workday in NOTES a bit.
            * Add upstream BZ reference for two missing LC_ADDRESS fields.
    Marko Myllynen
        Fix miscoded character

resolv.conf.5
    Jan Chaloupka
        Add missing no-tld-query option
            Based on commit [1], the no-tld-query option exists for
            resolv.conf configuration file.  Description of this option
            is provided in [2]. This patch just copies this option
            into resolv.conf.5 man page. Plus changes 'a' member
            into 'an' before 'unqualified name as if it ...'
            on the third line of [2]. Based on [3], this option
            was added in glibc 2.14 as solving [4] bug.

            [4] https://sourceware.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=12734

credentials.7
    Josh Triplett
        Cross-reference getgroups(2)
            Since credentials.7 discusses supplementary GIDs, it should
            reference getgroups(2).

fanotify.7
    Heinrich Schuchardt
        Allow relative paths in example
            The current example code requires passing an absolute
            path to the mount to be watched.

            By passing AT_FDCWD to fanotify_mark it can use both
            absolute and relative paths.
    Heinrich Schuchardt
        fallocate(2) creates no events
            fallocate(2) should create FAN_MODIFY events but does not.
    Heinrich Schuchardt [Michael Kerrisk]
        fanotify notifies only events generated on the same mount
            Unfortunately, fanotify does not inform listeners for all paths
            under which a touched filesystem object is visible, but only the
            listener using the same path as the process touching the
            filesystem object.
    Heinrich Schuchardt
        Update BUGS to note bugs still not fixed in 3.17
            I bumped the Linux version number in the BUGS section to 3.17.

inotify.7
    Heinrich Schuchardt
        fallocate(2) does not trigger inotify events
            Calling fallocate(2) does not result in inotify events.

locale.7
    Marko Myllynen
        Improve LOCPATH description
            LOCPATH is ignored by privileged programs.

            Add locale archive references.

            Add FILES section.

man-pages.7
    Michael Kerrisk  [Laurent Georget]
        Clarify that SEE ALSO entries may refer to pages from other projects

signal.7
    Michael Kerrisk
        Mention other "slow devices"
            Reads from eventfd(2), signalfd(2), timerfd(2), inotify(7),
            and fanotify(7) file descriptors are also slow operations
            that are restartable.
    Michael Kerrisk
        Fix SO_RECVTIMEO/ SO_SENDTIMEO confusion in text
    Michael Kerrisk
        Since Linux 3.8, reads on inotify(7) file descriptors are restartable
    Michael Kerrisk
        inotify(7) reads no longer show the odd EINTR error after SIGCONT
            Since kernel 3.7, reads from inotify(7) file descriptors no longer
            show the (Linux oddity) behavior of failing with EINTR when the
            process resumes after a stop signal + SIGCONT.
    Michael Kerrisk
        SEE ALSO: add sigreturn(2)

unix.7
    Michael Kerrisk  [Scott Harvey]
        Fix buglet in code snippet in BUGS section

ld.so.8
    Carlos O'Donell
        Add --inhibit-cache option
            The dynamic loader has 6 options, only 5 are documented.
            This patch documents the sixth option i.e. `--inhibit-cache`.
    Jonathan Wakely  [Siddhesh Poyarekar]
        Correct documentation of $ORIGIN
            As noted by Siddhesh:

                The ld.so man page says:

                    $ORIGIN (or equivalently ${ORIGIN})
                        This expands to the directory containing the
                        application executable.  Thus, an application located
                        in somedir/app could be compiled with

                This is incorrect since it expands to the directory containing
                the DSO and not the application executable.  This seems like
                deliberate behaviour in dl-object.c, so it needs to be fixed in
                the man page.

            See http://stackoverflow.com/questions/26280738/what-is-the-equivalent-of-loader-path-for-rpath-specification-on-linux/26281226#26281226

Apologies if I missed anyone!


New and rewritten pages
-----------------------

seccomp.2
    Kees Cook, Michael Kerrisk, Will Drewry  [Andy Lutomirski]
        New page documenting seccomp(2)
            Combines documentation from prctl, in-kernel seccomp_filter.txt
            and dropper.c, along with details specific to the new system call.


Newly documented interfaces in existing pages
---------------------------------------------

netlink.7
    Stephan Mueller  [Michael Kerrisk]
        Add NETLINK_CRYPTO


Changes to individual pages
---------------------------

adjtimex.2
    Laurent Georget  [Richard Cochran, Jeff Epler]
        Clarify the 'ppm scaling' used in struct timex
            This patch makes explicit and clarifies the unit used for
            the fields "freq", "ppsfreq" and "stabil" in struct timex.
    Michael Kerrisk  [Masanari Iida]
        Note that TIME_ERROR is the modern synonym for TIME_BAD

perf_event_open.2
    Vince Weaver
        Clarify the PERF_FLAG_FD_* flags
            This change clarifies the behavior of the PERF_FLAG_FD_OUTPUT and
            PERF_FLAG_FD_NO_GROUP flags to perf_event_open(), and removes
            the related FIXME comments.

            While writing tests to validate the behavior of these flags I
            discovered that PERF_FLAG_FD_OUTPUT has been broken since the
            2.6.35 kernel release.

prctl.2
    Dave Hansen [Michael Kerrisk]
        Add description of Intel MPX calls
            The 3.19 kernel will have support for Intel MPX, including
            a pair of new prctl() calls (PR_MPX_ENABLE_MANAGEMENT and
            PR_MPX_DISABLE_MANAGEMENT) for enabling and disabling the
            kernel's management of the "bounds tables".  Add a
            descriptions of the interface.
    Michael Kerrisk
        Add mention of seccomp(2) under PR_SET_SECCOMP
    Michael Kerrisk
        Suggest /proc/PID/status "Seccomp" as alternative to PR_GET_SECCOMP
    Michael Kerrisk
        SIGKILL can also occur PR_GET_SECCOMP in SECCOMP_MODE_FILTER mode
    Kees Cook  [Andy Lutomirski]
        Document SECCOMP_MODE_FILTER vs EFAULT
            This notes the distinction made between EINVAL and EFAULT when
            attempting to use SECCOMP_MODE_FILTER with PR_SET_SECCOMP.

setns.2
pid_namespaces.7
    Mike Frysinger
        Elaborate discussion of the PID namespace descendant limitation
            The setns(2) man page already mentions that CLONE_NEWPID may only
            be used with descendant namespaces, but this nuance could be
            listed in a few more places so it is not missed.

shmget.2
    Michael Kerrisk  [Akihiro Motoki]
        Make wording of SHMALL description a little clearer

sigaction.2
    Michael Kerrisk
        Add siginfo_t fields for SECCOMP_RET_TRAP

memchr.3
strstr.3
    Alexandre Bique
        Reference memmem(3) in SEE ALSO section

memcmp.3
    Michael Kerrisk  [Michael Haardt]
        NOTES: add some detail on avoiding memcmp() of cryptographic data
            Wording largely based on comments from Michael Haardt.

pthread_tryjoin_np.3
    Jérôme Pouiller  [Michael Kerrisk]
        Document EINVAL error for pthread_timedjoin_np()

mem.4
    Elie De Brauwer
        /dev/kmem depends on CONFIG_DEVKMEM
    Elie De Brauwer
        Correct /dev/port group in example
            mem.4 mentions that group for /dev/port should be set to 'mem'
            However, all other files (/dev/mem and /dev/kmem) use the kmem
            group in their examples and on my system /dev/port belongs to
            kmem. Hence the 'mem' group was probably a typo:
    Elie De Brauwer
        Add CONFIG_STRICT_DEVMEM
            Since 2.6.26 the CONFIG_NONPROMISC_DEVMEM options limits the
            physical addresses which can be accessed through /dev/mem.

random.4
    Heinrich Schuchardt
        Describe handling of O_NONBLOCK
            /dev/random and /dev/urandom treat O_NONBLOCK differently.
            This should be described in the manpage.
    Heinrich Schuchardt
        Mention PRNG used by urandom
            /dev/urandom uses a pseudo-random number generator to replace
            missing entropy.

proc.5
    Michael Kerrisk
        Document "Seccomp" field of /proc/PID/status

epoll.7
    Michael Kerrisk  [Ignat Loskutov]
        Use epoll_create1() rather than epoll_create() in the code example
            epoll_create1() is more or less the preferred API for new
            applications, since it allows for some flags and avoids the
            misdesigned epoll_create() argument, and so it seems sensible
            to use that in the example, rather than epoll_create().

tcp.7
    Troy Davis
        Clarify tcp_tw_recycle on Internet-facing hosts
            Clarify that tcp_tw_recycle will break communication with many
            general-purpose remote Internet hosts (namely, remote NAT devices)
            even when the Linux device itself is not behind NAT.

        SEE ALSO: add memfd_create(2)

open.2
    Michael Kerrisk
        Refer to RLIMIT_NOFILE for explanation of EMFILE error
    Michael Kerrisk
        Add execveat(2) in system call list under "Rationale for openat()"

perf_event_open.2
    Vince Weaver
        Clarify description of overflow events
            Update the perf_event_open manpage to be more consistent when
            discussing overflow events.  It merges the discussion of
            poll-type notifications with those generated by SIGIO
            signal handlers.
            This addresses the remaining FIXMEs is the document.
    Vince Weaver
        Remove inaccurate paragraph describing attr.config
            Remove an inaccurate paragraph about values in the attr.config
            field.  This information was never true in any released kernel;
            it somehow snuck into the manpage because it is still described
            this way in tools/perf/design.txt in the kernel source tree.
    Michael Kerrisk
        Correct the kernel version number for PERF_COUNT_HW_CACHE_NODE
    Michael Kerrisk
        Add some kernel version numbers to various fields and constants

ptrace.2
sigaction.2
seccomp.2
    Kees Cook
        Ptrace and siginfo details
            While writing some additional seccomp tests, I realized
            PTRACE_EVENT_SECCOMP wasn't documented yet. Fixed this, and added
            additional notes related to ptrace events SIGTRAP details.

readv.2
    Michael Kerrisk
        Update details on glibc readv()/writev() wrapper behavior
            And add a historical detail about Linux 2.0.

select.2
    Michael Kerrisk
        Mention RLIMIT_NOFILE as a possible cause of EINVAL error

syscall.2
    Kees Cook
        Add arm64 and mips
            Add mips and arm64 to tables, along with some further
            details on these architectures,

syscalls.2
    Michael Kerrisk
        Add s390_pci_mmio_read(2) and s390_pci_mmio_write(2)
    Michael Kerrisk
        Note kernel() version that introduced get_kernel_syms()
        Note kernel version that introduced ppc_rtas()
        Note kernel version that introduced create_module()
        Note kernel version that added setup()
    Michael Kerrisk
        Remove some details for sync_file_range2()
            Make the table a bit simpler. The details can anyway be
            found in the system call man page.

utimensat.2
    Michael Kerrisk  [Elliot Hughes]
        If both tv_sec fields are UTIME_OMIT, the file need not exist
            As noted by Elliot, if both tv_sec fields are UTIME_OMIT,
            utimensat() will return success even if the file does not exist.

errno.3
    Michael Kerrisk
        The RLIMIT_NOFILE resource limit is a common cause of EMFILE

exec.3
    Michael Kerrisk
        SEE ALSO: add execveat(2)

fclose.3
    Carlos O'Donell
        Consistency fix: use "stream" as name for "FILE *" argument
            Harmonize all the manual pages to use "stream" for FILE*
            instead of randomly using "fp" or "stream." Choosing something
            and being consistent helps users scan the man pages quickly
            and understand what they are looking at.

fexecve.3
    Michael Kerrisk
        Rewrite the script+close-on-exec problem as a BUG
            Also, add one or two details about this scenario.
    Michael Kerrisk
        The natural idiom when using fexecve() is to use the close-on-exec flag

fmemopen.3
    Michael Kerrisk
        Consistency fix: use "stream" as name for "FILE *" argument

fopencookie.3
    Michael Kerrisk
        Consistency fix: use "stream" as name for "FILE *" argument

        Consistency fix: use "stream" as name for "FILE *" argument

getspnam.3
    Carlos O'Donell
        Consistency fix: use "stream" as name for "FILE *" argument

malloc_info.3
    Carlos O'Donell
        Consistency fix: use "stream" as name for "FILE *" argument

posix_fallocate.3
    Michael Kerrisk
        Note that posix_fallocate() is implemented using fallocate(2)

putgrent.3
    Carlos O'Donell
        Consistency fix: use "stream" as name for "FILE *" argument
            Harmonize all the manual pages to use "stream" for FILE*
            instead of randomly using "fp" or "stream." Choosing something
            and being consistent helps users scan the man pages quickly
            and understand what they are looking at.

locale.5
    Akihiro Motoki
        Correct variable name

proc.5
    Michael Kerrisk
        Remove bogus statement about NR_OPEN being a ceiling for file-max

fflush.3
    Michael Kerrisk  [Sergey V. Zubkov]
        Clarify that flushing of input streams occurs only for seekable files
            See https://bugzilla.kernel.org/show_bug.cgi?id=91931
    Michael Kerrisk  [Sergey V. Zubkov]
        POSIX.1-2008 specifies the behavior when flushing input streams
            POSIX.1-2001 did not have a specification for input streams,
            but POSIX.1-2008 added one.

getopt.3

termios.3

        SEE ALSO: add reset(1), setterm(1), tput(1)

tzset.3
    J William Piggott
        Document behavior when TZ filespec omits the colon
            If the TZ filespec omits the leading colon, glibc will parse
            it for any valid format, i.e., it will still work.
    J William Piggott
        Add description for posixrules file
    J William Piggott
        Correct system timezone file path
    J William Piggott
        There are only two TZ formats
            tzset(3) currently states that there are three TZ formats. The
            first two it lists are actually variations of the POSIX-style
            TZ format, of which there are at least five variations.

            This patch corrects this to match the POSIX specification of
            TZ having only two formats.
    J William Piggott
        Filespec omitted incorrect
            Paragraph three of the DESCRIPTION section says
            that when TZ is set, but empty, then UTC is used.

            Later it says if the TZ filespec is omitted then the file
            /usr/share/zoneinfo/localtime is used.  This is incorrect,
            it will use UTC in that case as well.
    J William Piggott
        Fix incorrect TZ string representation
            The TZ string representation indicates that the start/end
            rules are required; this is incorrect.
    J William Piggott
        Add ENVIRONMENT section + other rearrangements
            FILES section was overly verbose and included
            environment variables.  Added ENVIRONMENT section,
            removing ENV VARS from the FILES section.

New and rewritten pages
-----------------------

ioctl_fat.2
    Heinrich Schuchardt  [Michael Kerrisk]
        New man page for the ioctl(2) FAT API
            The ioctl(2) system call may be used to retrieve information about
            the FAT file system and to set file attributes.

madvise.2
    Michael Kerrisk
         Summary: this page has been significantly reorganised and rewritten
    Michael Kerrisk
        Recast discussion of 'advice' into two groups of values
            madvise() is one of those system calls that has congealed over
            time, as has the man page. It's helpful to split the discussion
            of 'advice' into those flags into two groups:

            * Those flags that are (1) widespread across implementations;
              (2) have counterparts in posix_madvise(3); and (3) were present
              in the initial Linux madvise implementation.
            * The rest, which are values that (1) may not have counterparts
              in other implementations; (2) have no counterparts in
              posix_madvise(3); and (3) were added to Linux in more recent
              times.
    Michael Kerrisk
        Explicitly list the five flags provided by posix_fadvise()
            Over time, bit rot has afflicted this page. Since the original
            text was written many new Linux-specific flags have been added.
            So, now it's better to explicitly list the flags that
            correspond to the POSIX analog of madvise().
    Jan Chaloupka  [Hugh Dickins, Michael Kerrisk]
        Starting with Linux 3.5, more file systems support MADV_REMOVE
    Michael Kerrisk
        Split EINVAL error into separate cases
    Michael Kerrisk
        Explain MADV_REMOVE in terms of file hole punching
    Michael Kerrisk
        MADV_REMOVE can be applied only to shared writable mappings
    Michael Kerrisk
        MADV_REMOVE cannot be applied to locked or Huge TLB pages
    Michael Kerrisk  [Vlastimil Babka]
        Clarify that MADV_DONTNEED has effect on pages only if it succeeds
    Michael Kerrisk  [Vlastimil Babka]
        Clarifications for MADV_DONTNEED
    Michael Kerrisk  [Michal Hocko]
        Improve MADV_DONTNEED description
    Michael Kerrisk
        MADV_DONTNEED cannot be applied to Huge TLB or locked pages
    Michael Kerrisk  [Vlastimil Babka]
        Remove mention of "shared pages" as a cause of EINVAL for MADV_DONTNEED
    Michael Kerrisk  [Vlastimil Babka]
        Note Huge TLB as a cause of EINVAL for MADV_DONTNEED
    Michael Kerrisk  [Minchan Kim]
        Add mention of VM_PFNMAP in discussion of MADV_DONTNEED and MADV_REMOVE
    Michael Kerrisk
        Drop sentence saying that kernel may ignore 'advice'
            The sentence creates misunderstandings, and does not really
            add information.
    Michael Kerrisk
        Note that some Linux-specific 'advice' change memory-access semantics
    Michael Kerrisk
        NOTES: Remove crufty text about "command" versus "advice"
            The point made in this fairly ancient text is more or less evident
            from the DESCRIPTION, and it's not clear what "standard" is being
            referred to.
    Michael Kerrisk
        Mention POSIX.1-2008 addition of POSIX_MADV_NOREUSE
    Michael Kerrisk
        Remove "POSIX.1b" from CONFORMING TO
    Michael Kerrisk
        Move mention of posix_fadvise() from CONFORMING TO to SEE ALSO
    Michael Kerrisk
        ERRORS: add EPERM error case for MADV_HWPOISON
    Michael Kerrisk
        Note that madvise() is nonstandard, but widespread


Newly documented interfaces in existing pages

    Michael Kerrisk
        Document /proc/sys/kernel/auto_msgmni

socket.7
    David Wilson  [Michael Kerrisk]
        Document SO_REUSEPORT socket option


New and changed links
---------------------

get_thread_area.2
    Andy Lutomirski
        Make get_thread_area.2 a link to rewritten set_thread_area.2 page


Changes to individual pages
---------------------------

time.1
    Michael Kerrisk
        Make option argument formatting consistent with other pages

access.2
    Denys Vlasenko
        Explain how access() check treats capabilities
            We have users who are terribly confused why their binaries
            with CAP_DAC_OVERRIDE capability see EACCESS from access() calls,
            but are able to read the file.

            The reason is access() isn't the "can I read/write/execute this
            file?" question, it is the "(assuming that I'm a setuid binary,)
            can *the user who invoked me* read/write/execute this file?"
            question.

            That's why it uses real UIDs as documented, and why it ignores
            capabilities when capability-endorsed binaries are run by non-root
            (this patch adds this information).

            To make users more likely to notice this less-known detail,
            the patch expands the explanation with rationale for this logic
            into a separate paragraph.

arch_prctl.2
set_thread_area.2
get_thread_area.2
    Andy Lutomirski
        Improve TLS documentation
            The documentation for set_thread_area was very vague.  This
            improves it, accounts for recent kernel changes, and merges
            it with get_thread_area.2.

            get_thread_area.2 now becomes a link.

            While I'm at it, clarify the related arch_prctl.2 man page.

cacheflush.2
    Ralf Baechle
        Update some portability details and bugs
    Michael Kerrisk
        Refer reader to BUGS in discussion of EINVAL error

capget.2
    Michael Kerrisk
        Document V3 capabilities constants
    Michael Kerrisk
        Rewrite discussion of kernel versions that support file capabilities
            File capabilities ceased to be optional in Linux 2.6.33.

clone.2
    Peng Haitao
        Fix description of CLONE_PARENT_SETTID
            CLONE_PARENT_SETTID only stores child thread ID in parent memory.

clone.2
execve.2
    Kevin Easton
        Document interaction of execve(2) with CLONE_FILES
            This patch the fact that a successful execve(2) in a process that
            is sharing a file descriptor table results in unsharing the table.

            I discovered this through testing and verified it by source
            inspection - there is a call to unshare_files() early in
            do_execve_common().

fcntl.2
    Michael Kerrisk  [Jeff Layton]
        Clarify cases of conflict between traditional record and OFD locks
            Verified by experiment on Linux 3.15 and 3.19rc4.

fork.2
    Michal Hocko
        EAGAIN is not reported when task allocation fails
            I am not sure why we have:

               "EAGAIN fork() cannot allocate sufficient memory to copy
                the parent's page tables and allocate a task structure
                or the child."

            The text seems to be there from the time when man-pages
            were moved to git so there is no history for it.

            And it doesn't reflect reality: the kernel reports both
            dup_task_struct and dup_mm failures as ENOMEM to the
            userspace. This seems to be the case from early 2.x times
            so let's simply remove this part.
    Heinrich Schuchardt
        Child and parent run in separate memory spaces
            fork.2 should clearly point out that child and parent
            process run in separate memory spaces.
    Michael Kerrisk
        NOTES: add "C library/kernel ABI differences" subheading

getpid.2
    Michael Kerrisk
        NOTES: add "C library/kernel ABI differences" subheading

getxattr.2
    Michael Kerrisk
        Various rewordings plus one or two details clarified
    Michael Kerrisk
        Add pointer to example in listxattr(2)

killpg.2
    Michael Kerrisk
        NOTES: add "C library/kernel ABI differences" subheading

listxattr.2
    Heinrich Schuchardt
        Provide example program
    Michael Kerrisk
        Reword discussion of size==0 case
    Michael Kerrisk
        Add note on handling increases in sizes of keys or values
    Michael Kerrisk
        Remove mention of which filesystems implement ACLs
            Such a list will only become outdated (as it already was).

migrate_pages.2
    Jan Stancek
        Document EFAULT and EINVAL errors
            I encountered these errors while writing testcase for migrate_pages
            syscall for LTP (Linux test project).

            I checked stable kernel tree 3.5 to see which paths return these.
            Both can be returned from get_nodes(), which is called from:
            SYSCALL_DEFINE4(migrate_pages, pid_t, pid, unsigned long, maxnode,
                            const unsigned long __user *, old_nodes,
                            const unsigned long __user *, new_nodes)

            The testcase does following:
            EFAULT
            a) old_nodes/new_nodes is area mmaped with PROT_NONE
            b) old_nodes/new_nodes is area not mmapped in process address
               space, -1 or area that has been just munmmaped

            EINVAL
            a) maxnodes overflows kernel limit
            b) new_nodes contain node, which has no memory or does not exist
               or is not returned for get_mempolicy(MPOL_F_MEMS_ALLOWED).

modify_ldt.2
    Andy Lutomirski
        Overhaul the documentation
            This clarifies the behavior and documents all four functions.
    Andy Lutomirski
        Clarify the lm bit's behavior
            The lm bit should never have existed in the first place.  Sigh.

mprotect.2
    Mark Seaborn
        Mention effect of READ_IMPLIES_EXEC personality flag
            I puzzled over mprotect()'s effect on /proc/*/maps for a while
            yesterday -- it was setting "x" without PROT_EXEC being specified.
            Here is a patch to add some explanation.

msgget.2
    Michael Kerrisk
        Add details of MSGMNI default value

msgop.2
    Michael Kerrisk
        Clarify wording of MSGMAX and MSGMNB limits

perf_event_open.2
    Vince Weaver
        Clarify PERF_EVENT_IOC_REFRESH behavior
            Currently the PERF_EVENT_IOC_REFRESH ioctl, when applied to a group
            leader, will refresh all children.  Also if a refresh value of 0
            is chosen then the refresh becomes infinite (never runs out).
            Back in 2011 PAPI was relying on these behaviors but I was told
            that both were unsupported and subject to being removed at any time.
            (See https://lkml.org/lkml/2011/5/24/337 )
            However the behavior has not been changed.

            This patch updates the manpage to still list the behavior as
            unsupported, but removes the inaccurate description of it
            only being a problem with 2.6 kernels.

prctl.2
    Michael Kerrisk  [Bill McConnaughey]
        Mention file capabilities in discussion of PR_SET_DUMPABLE
    Michael Kerrisk
        Greatly expand discussion of "dumpable" flag
            In particular, detail the interactions with
            /proc/sys/fs/suid_dumpable.
    Michael Kerrisk
        Reorder paragraphs describing PR_SET_DUMPABLE
    Michael Kerrisk
        Mention SUID_DUMP_DISABLE and SUID_DUMP_USER under PR_SET_DUMPABLE
    Michael Kerrisk
        Executing a file with capabilities also resets the parent death signal

ptrace.2
    James Hunt
        Explain behaviour should ptrace tracer call execve(2)
            This behaviour was verified by reading the kernel source and
            confirming the behaviour using a test program.
    Denys Vlasenko
        Add information on PTRACE_SEIZE versus PTRACE_ATTACH differences
            Extend description of PTRACE_SEIZE with the short summary of its
            differences from PTRACE_ATTACH.

            The following paragraph:

            PTRACE_EVENT_STOP
                   Stop induced by PTRACE_INTERRUPT command, or group-stop, or ini-
                   tial  ptrace-stop when a new child is attached (only if attached
                   using PTRACE_SEIZE), or PTRACE_EVENT_STOP if PTRACE_SEIZE was used.

            has an editing error (the part after last comma makes no sense).
            Removing it.

            Mention that legacy post-execve SIGTRAP is disabled by PTRACE_SEIZE.

sched_setattr.2
    Michael Kerrisk  [Christophe Blaess]
        SYNOPSIS: remove 'const' from 'attr' sched_getattr() argument

semget.2
    Michael Kerrisk
        Note default value for SEMMNI and SEMMSL

    Michael Kerrisk
        Note that zero-length attribute values are permitted
    Michael Kerrisk
        Rework text describing 'flags' argument

stat.2
    Michael Kerrisk
        NOTES: add "C library/kernel ABI differences" subheading

statfs.2
    Michael Kerrisk  [Jan Chaloupka]
        Document the 'f_flags' field added in Linux 2.6.36
    Michael Kerrisk
        Clarify that 'statfs' structure has some padding bytes
            The number of padding bytes has changed over time, as some
            bytes are used, so describe this aspect of the structure
            less explicitly.
    Tao Ma
        Add OCFS2_SUPER_MAGIC
    Michael Kerrisk
        Use __fsword_t in statfs structure definition
            This more closely matches modern glibc reality.
    Michael Kerrisk
        Add a note on the __fsword_t type
    Michael Kerrisk
        Document 'f_spare' more vaguely

wait.2
    Michael Kerrisk
        Note that waitpid() is a wrapper for wait4()
    Michael Kerrisk
        Note that wait() is a library function implemented via wait4()

wait4.2
    Michael Kerrisk
        NOTES: add "C library/kernel ABI differences" subheading

encrypt.3
    Rob Somers
        Improve code example
            I (and some others) found that the original example code
            did not seem to work as advertised.  The new code (used by
            permission of the original author, Jens Thoms Toerring)
            was found on comp.os.linux.development.

mktemp.3
    Luke Faraone
        DESCRIPTION reference to BUGS corrected
            mktemp(3)'s DESCRIPTION referenced NOTES, but no such
            section exists. Corrected to refer to BUGS.

pthread_attr_setschedparam.3
    Tobias Herzke
        Describe EINVAL in ERRORS

resolver.3
host.conf.5
    Simon Paillard
        host.conf 'order' option deprecated, replaced by nsswitch.conf(5)
            http://www.sourceware.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=2389
            http://repo.or.cz/w/glibc.git/commit/b9c65d0902e5890c4f025b574725154032f8120a

            Reported at http://bugs.debian.org/270368,
            http://bugs.debian.org/396633, and http://bugs.debian.org/344233.

statvfs.3
    Michael Kerrisk
        Document missing 'f_flag' bit values
            And reorganize information relating to which flags are in
            POSIX.1.
    Michael Kerrisk  [Jan Chaloupka]
        statvfs() now populates 'f_flag' from  statfs()'s f_flag field
            These changes came with glibc 2.13, and the kernel's addition of
            a 'f_flags' field in Linux 2.6.36.

syslog.3
    Michael Kerrisk  [Doug Goldstein]
        Remove unneeded <stdarg.h>
            vsyslog() does not need this.

tzset.3
    J William Piggott
        Add offset format
            tzset.3 does not illustrate the POSIX offset format.
            Specifically, there is no indication in the manual
            what the optional components of it are.

random.4
    Michael Kerrisk
        Note maximum number of bytes returned by read(2) on /dev/random
    Michael Kerrisk  [Mathieu Malaterre]
        Since Linux 3.16, reads from /dev/urandom return at most 32 MB
            See https://bugs.debian.org/775328 and
            https://bugzilla.kernel.org/show_bug.cgi?id=80981#c9

core.5
    Michael Kerrisk  [Bill McConnaughey]
        Executing a file that has capabilities also prevents core dumps
    Michael Kerrisk
        Document "%i" and "%I" core_pattern specifiers

intro.5
    Michael Kerrisk
        Remove words "and protocols"
            There are no protocol descriptions in Section 5. Protocols are
            in Section 7.

proc.5
    Michael Kerrisk
        Add reference to prctl(2) in discussion of /proc/sys/fs/suid_dumpable
            And note that /proc/sys/fs/suid_dumpable defines the
            value assigned to the process "dumpable" flag in certain
            circumstances.
    Michael Kerrisk
        Note that CAP_SYS_ADMIN is required to list /proc/PID/map_files
            This might however change in the future; see the Jan 2015 LKML thread:

                    Re: [RFC][PATCH v2] procfs: Always expose /proc/<pid>/map_files/
                                        and make it readable

resolv.conf.5
    Michael Kerrisk
        SEE ALSO: add nsswitch.conf(5)

capabilities.7
    Michael Kerrisk
        Mention SECBIT_KEEP_CAPS as an alternative to prctl() PR_SET_KEEPCAPS
    Chris Mayo
        NOTES: add last kernel versions for obsolete options
            The CONFIG_SECURITY_CAPABILITIES option was removed by
            commit 5915eb53861c5776cfec33ca4fcc1fd20d66dd27

            The CONFIG_SECURITY_FILE_CAPABILITIES option removed in
            Linux 2.6.33 as already mentioned in DESCRIPTION.

pthreads.7
    Michael Kerrisk
        SEE ALSO: add fork(2)

unix.7
    Jan Chaloupka
        Mention SOCK_STREAM socket for ioctl_type of ioctl()
            from https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1110401.

            unix.7 is not clear about socket type of ioctl_type argument of
            ioctl() function. The description of SIOCINQ is applicable only
            for SOCK_STREAM socket. For SOCK_DGRAM, udp(7) man page gives
            correct description of SIOCINQ

ldconfig.8
    Michael Kerrisk
        Place options in alphabetical order
    Michael Kerrisk
        Note glibc version number for '-l' option
    Michael Kerrisk
        Document -c/--format option
    Michael Kerrisk
        Add long form of some options
    Michael Kerrisk  [Patrick Horgan]
        ld.so.conf uses only newlines as delimiters
            mtk: confirmed by reading source of parse_conf() in
            elf/ldconfig.c.
    Michael Kerrisk
        Document -V/--version option
    Michael Kerrisk
        Document -i/--ignore-aux-cache option

ld.so.8
    Michael Kerrisk
        Relocate "Hardware capabilities" to be a subsection under notes
            This is more consistent with standard man-pages headings
            and layout.
    Michael Kerrisk
        (Briefly) document LD_TRACE_PRELINKING
    Michael Kerrisk
        Remove duplicate description of LD_BIND_NOT

clone.2
    Josh Triplett
        Document that clone() silently ignores CLONE_PID and CLONE_STOPPED
            Normally, system calls return EINVAL for flags they don't support.
            Explicitly document that clone does *not* produce an error for
            these two obsolete flags.
    Michael Kerrisk
        Small rewording of explanation of clone() wrt threads
            Clone has so many effects that it's an oversimplification to say
            that the *main* use of clone is to create a thread.  (In fact,
            the use of clone() to create new processes may well be more
            common, since glibc's fork() is a wrapper that calls clone().)

getgroups.2
    Michael Kerrisk  [Shawn Landden]
        Add discussion of NPTL credential-changing mechanism
            At the kernel level, credentials (UIDs and GIDs) are a per-thread
            attribute. NPTL uses a signal-based mechanism to ensure that
            when one thread changes its credentials, all other threads change
            credentials to the same values. By this means, the NPTL
            implementation conforms to the POSIX requirement that the threads

            when one thread changes its credentials, all other threads change
            credentials to the same values. By this means, the NPTL

            I recently realized that I had been reasoning improperly about
            what umount(MNT_DETACH) did based on an insufficient description
            in the umount.2 man page, that matched my intuition but not the
            implementation.

            When there are no submounts, MNT_DETACH is essentially harmless to
            applications.  Where there are submounts, MNT_DETACH changes what
            is visible to applications using the detach directories.

            are using symbols in this library*. That latter text has
            been there since man-pages-1.29, but it seems rather dubious.
            How could the implementation know whether other libraries
            are still using symbols in this library? Furthermore, no
            other implementation's man page mentions this point.
            Seems best to drop this point.

user_namespaces.7
    Eric W. Biederman
        Update the documentation to reflect the fixes for negative groups
            Files with access permissions such as rwx---rwx give fewer
            permissions to their group then they do to everyone else.  Which
            means dropping groups with setgroups(0, NULL) actually grants a
            process privileges.

            The unprivileged setting of gid_map turned out not to be safe
            after this change.  Privileged setting of gid_map can be
            interpreted as meaning yes it is ok to drop groups. [ Eric
            additionally noted: Setting of gid_map with privilege has been
            clarified to mean that dropping groups is ok.  This allows
            existing programs that set gid_map with privilege to work
            without changes.  That is, newgidmap(1) continues to work
            unchanged.]

            To prevent this problem and future problems, user namespaces were
            changed in such a way as to guarantee a user can not obtain
            credentials without privilege that they could not obtain without
            the help of user namespaces.

            This meant testing the effective user ID and not the filesystem
            user ID, as setresuid(2) and setregid(2) allow setting any process
            UID or GID (except the supplementary groups) to the effective ID.

            Furthermore, to preserve in some form the useful applications
            that have been setting gid_map without privilege, the file
            /proc/[pid]/setgroups was added to allow disabling setgroups(2).
            With setgroups(2) permanently disabled in a user namespace, it
            again becomes safe to allow writes to gid_map without privilege.
    Michael Kerrisk
        Rework some text describing permission rules for updating map files
            No (intentional) change to the facts, but this restructuring
            should make the meaning easier to grasp.
    Michael Kerrisk
        Update kernel version associated with 5-line limit for map files
            As at Linux 3.18, the limit is still five lines, so mention the
            more recent kernel version in the text.
    Michael Kerrisk  [Alban Crequy]
        Handle /proc/PID/setgroups in the example program
    Michael Kerrisk
        Rework text describing restrictions on updating /proc/PID/setgroups
            No (intentional) changes to factual description, but the
            restructured text is hopefully easier to grasp.
    Michael Kerrisk
        Explain why the /proc/PID/setgroups file was added

ldconfig.8
    Michael Kerrisk
        Note use of /lib64 and /usr/lib64 on some 64-bit architectures

ld.so.8
    Michael Kerrisk
        Note the use of /lib64 and /usr/lib64 on some 64-bit architectures

New and rewritten pages
-----------------------

posix_madvise.3
    Michael Kerrisk
        New page documenting posix_madvise(3)

ftw.3
    Michael Kerrisk
        Reorganize the page to give primacy to nftw()
            nftw() is the better API, and POSIX.1-2008 marks ftw() obsolete.

Newly documented interfaces in existing pages
---------------------------------------------

getdents.2
    Michael Kerrisk  [Dima Tisnek]
        Document getdents64()
            See https://bugzilla.kernel.org/show_bug.cgi?id=14795

    Michael Kerrisk
        New link to getrlimit.2


Global changes
--------------

Various section 3 math pages
    Michael Kerrisk
        Note that these functions are also in POSIX.1-2001 and POSIX.1-2008


Changes to individual pages
---------------------------

getent.1
    Robin H. Johnson
        Document options
            The options to getent are now documented, after being around for
            nearly a decade without changes.
    Michael Kerrisk
        Document help and version options

fallocate.2
    Michael Kerrisk
        Fix kernel version number for FALLOC_FL_ZERO_RANGE
            FALLOC_FL_ZERO_RANGE was added in 3.15, not 3.14.
    Michael Kerrisk
        Note that SMB3 added FALLOC_FL_ZERO_RANGE support in Linux 3.17

getrlimit.2
    Michael Kerrisk
        Note that the underlying system call for prlimit() is prlimit64()
    Michael Kerrisk
        Remove "_FILE_OFFSET_BITS == 64" from prlimit() FTM requirements
            "_FILE_OFFSET_BITS == 64" is not needed to get the prlimit()
            declaration.

ioctl_list.2
    Nikos Mavrogiannopoulos
        SIOCADDRT accepts in6_rtmsg in INET6 protocol
    Heinrich Schuchardt
        TFD_IOC_SET_TICKS
            timerfd_create.2 mentions TFD_IOC_SET_TICKS. We should add it to
            ioctl_list.2, too.

llseek.2
    Michael Kerrisk
        Advise reader to use lseek(2) instead
    Michael Kerrisk
        llseek() exists on 32-bit platforms to support seeking to large offsets

madvise.2
    David Rientjes
        Specify MADV_REMOVE returns EINVAL for hugetlbfs
            madvise(2) actually returns with error EINVAL for MADV_REMOVE
            when used for hugetlb VMAs, not EOPNOTSUPP, and this has been
            the case since MADV_REMOVE was introduced in commit f6b3ec238d12
            ("madvise(MADV_REMOVE): remove pages from tmpfs shm backing
            store"). Specify the exact behavior.
    Michael Kerrisk
        SEE ALSO: add posix_madvise(2)

poll.2
    Michael Kerrisk  [Andreas Baak]
        SEE ALSO: add epoll(7)

        Add "C library/kernel ABI differences" subsection

pread.2
    Michael Kerrisk
        Add "C library/kernel ABI differences" subsection

seccomp.2
    Michael Kerrisk  [Pierre Chifflier, Kees Cook]
        Note that seccomp_data is read-only

stat.2
    Michael Kerrisk
        Add some details on various "stat" versions
            Three versions of "stat" appeared on 32-bit systems,
            dealing with structures of different (increasing) sizes.
            Explain some of the details, and also note that the
            situation is simpler on modern 64-bit architectures.
    Michael Kerrisk
        Add mention of newfstatat()
            The underlying system call for fstatat() is newfstatat()
            on some architectures.

symlink.2
    Michael Kerrisk  [Jonny Grant]
        ERRORS: add linkpath=="" case for ENOENT

syscalls.2
    Michael Kerrisk
        Remove prlimit()
            There really is only the prlimit64() system call.
    Michael Kerrisk
        Add some details about the "multiple versions of system calls"
            The multiple-system-call-version phenomenon is particularly a
            feature of older 32-bit platforms. Hint at that fact in the text.

timerfd_create.2
    Cyrill Gorcunov  [Michael Kerrisk]
        Document TFD_IOC_SET_TICKS ioctl() operation
    Michael Kerrisk
        Add some details to C library/kernel ABI differences

unshare.2
    Michael Kerrisk  [Fabien Pichot]

        Correct prototype for execle()
            Make the prototype shown into correct C.

ftw.3
    Michael Kerrisk  [Felix Sedlmeier]
        ftw() and nftw() differ for the non-stat-able symlink case
            The POSIX specification of ftw() says that an un-stat-able
            symlink may yield either FTW_NS or FTW_SL. The specification
            of nftw() does not carry this statement.
    Michael Kerrisk

    Walter Harms  [Michael Kerrisk]
        Simplify the example code

qsort.3
    Michael Kerrisk  [Rob Landley]
        alphasort() and versionsort() are not suitable for 'compar'
            In glibc 2.10, the prototypes of alphasort() and versionsort()
            were changed so that the arguments switched from 'const void *' to
            'const struct dirent **', to match the POSIX.1-2008 specification
            of alphasort(). As such, compiler warnings will result if
            these functions are used as the arguments of qsort().

                warning: passing argument 4 of 'qsort' from incompatible
                pointer type
                expected '__compar_fn_t' but argument is of type
                'int (*)(const struct dirent **, const struct dirent **)'

            Therefore, remove the ancient NOTES text suggesting that
            alphasort() and versionsort() can be used as suitable
            'compar' arguments for qsort().

realpath.3
    Michael Kerrisk  [Jon Grant]
        Add ENOMEM error

scandir.3
    Michael Kerrisk
        glibc 2.10 changed the argument types for alphasort() and versionsort()
    Zeng Linggang

strcasecmp.3
    Michael Kerrisk  [Jonny Grant]
        Clarify that strcasecmp() does a byte-wise comparison
    Michael Kerrisk

    Michael Kerrisk
        Describe "mnt_id" field of /proc/PID/fdinfo
    Michael Kerrisk
        Note that abstract sockets are included in /proc/net/unix
    Michael Kerrisk
        Update description /proc/sys/unix 'Type' field
            The existing text was very crufty. UNIX domain sockets
            support more than SOCK_STREAM for a _very_ long time now.
    Michael Kerrisk
        Add some detail to /proc/PID/timers
    Michael Kerrisk  [Vlastimil Babka]
        Enhance discussion of /proc/PID/status 'VmSwap' field

New and rewritten pages
-----------------------

get_phys_pages.3
    William Woodruff
        Document get_phys_pages() and get_avphys_pages()

loop.4
    Urs Thuermann, Michael Kerrisk
        New page documenting the loop device

xattr.7
    Andreas Gruenbacher
        Import attr(5) man page from the 'attr' project
            After discussions with Andreas Gruenbacher, it makes sense to
            move this page into man-pages, since it mostly relates to
            kernel details. Since this is an overview page,
            we'll move it to Section 7.
    Michael Kerrisk
         Rename page
            "xattr" is a more meaningful name than "attr" (it resonates
            with the names of the system calls), so as long as we are
            moving the page to a new section, we'll change the name as well,
            and retain an acl(5) link so that old references remain valid.

mknod.2
    Michael Kerrisk
        Rewordings + point reader at stat(2) for details of mode bits

mmap.2
    Michael Kerrisk
        Remove text that implies that munmap() syncs MAP_SHARED mapping to file
            The existing text in this page:

                   MAP_SHARED Share  this  mapping.   Updates to the mapping
                              are visible to other processes that  map  this
                              file,  and are carried through to the underly‐
                              ing  file.   The  file  may  not  actually  be
                              updated until msync(2) or munmap() is called.

            implies that munmap() will sync the mapping to the underlying
            file. POSIX doesn't require this, and some light reading of the
            code and some light testing (fsync() after munmap() of a large
            file) also indicates that Linux doesn't do this.

msync.2
    Michael Kerrisk
        Rework text of DESCRIPTION
            Rewrite the text somewhat, for easier comprehension.
            No (intentional) changes to factual content

    Michael Kerrisk
        Add text on POSIX terms "file mode bits" and "file permission bits"
            Recent changes to various pages employ this distinction.
    Michael Kerrisk
        Tighten wording: use 'mode bit' rather than 'permission bit'
            According to POSIX, the 9 UGO*RWX bits are permissions, and
            'mode' is used to refer to collectively to those bits plus sticky,
            set-UID, and set_GID bits.

            See https://bugzilla.kernel.org/show_bug.cgi?id=15952

CPU_SET.3
    Chris Metcalf
        Clarify language about "available" cpus
            The CPU_SET.3 man page uses the adjective "available" when
            explaining what the argument to CPU_SET() means.  This is
            confusing, since "available" isn't well-defined.  The kernel
            has a set of adjectives (possible, present, online, and active)
            that qualify cpus, but normally none of these are what the
            cpu_set_t bit index means: it's just "which cpu", using the
            kernel's internal numbering system, even if that cpu isn't
            possible or present.

            This change removes the word "available" and adds a sentence
            warning that cpu sets may not be contiguous due to dynamic
            cpu hotplug, etc.

        Update discussion of 'debug' option
            See https://bugzilla.kernel.org/show_bug.cgi?id=97161
    Michael Kerrisk
        Summary of multiple changes: remove cruft from this page.
            Much of the detail on hardware specifics in this page dates
            from the 20th century. (The last major update to this page was in
            man-pages-1.14!) It's hugely out of date now (many of these
            devices disappeared from the kernel years ago.) So, I've taken
            a large scythe to the page to remove anything that looks
            seriously dated. In the process, the page has shrunk to less
            than 50% of its previous size.
    Michael Kerrisk
        Remove "buff=" details
            This seems to have gone away in Linux 2.2.
    Michael Kerrisk
        Remove crufty "Mouse drivers" options
    Michael Kerrisk
        Remove crufty "General non-device-specific boot arguments" options
    Michael Kerrisk
        Remove crufty "Hard disks" options
    Michael Kerrisk
        Remove crufty "mem=" details
    Michael Kerrisk
        Remove crufty details on IBM MCA bus devices
    Michael Kerrisk
        Remove 'swap=" details
            This seems to have gone away in Linux 2.2,
    Michael Kerrisk
        Remove crufty floppy disk driver options
            In the specific case of floppy drives: the drivers still
            exist, but it's been a while since most of saw these devices
            in the wild. So, just refer the reader to the kernel source
            file for details. (The detail in this man page was after all
            originally drawn from that file.)
        Remove crufty "ISDN drivers" options
    Michael Kerrisk
        Remove crufty "line printer driver" options
    Michael Kerrisk
        Remove crufty "Serial port drivers" options
    Michael Kerrisk
        Remove crufty reference to CONFIG_BUGi386
            That option disappeared in Linux 2.4.
    Michael Kerrisk
        Remove crufty text
            "bootsetups array" dates from Linux 2.0.
    Michael Kerrisk
        Remove crufty "Video hardware" options
    Michael Kerrisk
        Remove crufty SCSI device driver options

inotify.7
    Michael Kerrisk  [Heinrich Schuchardt]
        Since Linux 3.19, fallocate(2) generates IN_MODIFY events

    Michael Kerrisk  [Jiri Pirko, Magnus REFTEL]
        Clarify details of the IP_MULTICAST_IF socket option
    Michael Kerrisk  [Advait Dixi]

            See https://bugzilla.kernel.org/show_bug.cgi?id=35852
    Michael Kerrisk
        Relocate misplaced text describing ENOPROTOOPT error

packet.7
    Graham Shaw
        Add sll_protocol to list of required fields for outbound packets

pthreads.7
    Michael Kerrisk  [KOSAKI Motohiro]
        Using thread IDs whose lifetime has expired gives undefined behavior
            See https://bugzilla.kernel.org/show_bug.cgi?id=53061

raw.7
    Michael Kerrisk  [Tetsuo Handa]
        For incoming datagrams, sin_port is set to zero
    Michael Kerrisk
        Mention sendto(), recvfrom(), and so on when discussing address format
            This gives the reader a little context for the following
            discussion of 'sin_port'.
    Michael Kerrisk
        Remove crufty reference to <netinet/in.h>
    Michael Kerrisk
        Replace reference to RFC 1700 with pointer to IANA protocol number list

signal.7
    Michael Kerrisk  [Steinar H. Gunderson]
        Clarify that I/O operations on disks are not interrupted by signals
            See https://bugzilla.kernel.org/show_bug.cgi?id=97721

unix.7
    Michael Kerrisk  [Christophe Lohr]
        Remove mention of UNIX_PATH_MAX
            This kernel constant is not exposed to user space.
    Michael Kerrisk
        Note the 108 bytes for sun_path is how things are done on Linux
            And refer the reader to NOTES for discussion of portability.

xattr.7
    Michael Kerrisk
        Document EA limits for Btrfs
    Michael Kerrisk
        Document VFS-imposed limits on EAs
            VFS imposes a 255-byte limit on EA names, and a 64kB limit on
            EA values.
    Michael Kerrisk
        The ext[234] block limitation applies to sum of all EAs
            It is not a per-EA limit.
    Michael Kerrisk
        Clarify permissions required to work with 'user' EAs
    Michael Kerrisk
        ext2 and ext3 no longer need mounting with 'user_xattr' for user EAs
    Michael Kerrisk
        Add various relevant pages to SEE ALSO
    Michael Kerrisk
        Add CONFORMING TO section
    Michael Kerrisk
        Modify headings to man-pages norms
    Michael Kerrisk
        Btrfs also supports extended attributes
    Michael Kerrisk
        File capabilities are implemented using *security* attributes
            Not *system* attributes
    Michael Kerrisk
        Describe limit on EA values for JFS, XFS, and Reiserfs
    Michael Kerrisk
        Explicitly mention some of the xattr system calls in DESCRIPTION
            Naming the system calls helps to orient the reader

nscd.8
    Michael Kerrisk
        Add mention of 'services' and 'netgroup' databases
            This makes the page consistent with nscd.conf(5).

-----------------------

bpf.2
    Alexei Starovoitov, Michael Kerrisk  [Daniel Borkmann]
        New page documenting bpf(2)

__ppc_get_timebase.3
    Tulio Magno Quites Machado Filho
        New page documenting __ppc_get_timebase() and __ppc_get_timebase_freq()
            Glibc 2.16 was released with a new function for the Power
            architecture that can read its Time Base Register.
            Glibc 2.17 adds a function to read the frequency at which the Time
            Base Register of Power processors is updated.

queue.3
    Michael Kerrisk  [David Leppik, Doug Klima]
        Reimport from latest FreeBSD page
            Long ago, Doug Klima noted that many macros were not
            documented in the queue(3) page. Fix by reimporting from
            latest [1] FreeBSD man page.

            [1] Revision 263142, Modified Fri Mar 14 03:07:51 2014 UTC

Global changes
--------------

Various pages
    Michael Kerrisk  [Andries E. Brouwer]
        Remove "ABI" from "C library/kernel ABI differences" subheadings
            The "ABI" doesn't really convey anything significant in
            the title. These subsections are about describing differences
            between the kernel and (g)libc interfaces.


Changes to individual pages
---------------------------

intro.1
    Michael Kerrisk  [Andries E. Brouwer]
        Drop intro paragraph on '$?' shell variable
            As Andries notes, this piece of text is rather out of place in
            a page that was intended to provide a tutorial introduction for
            beginners logging in on a Linux system.

locale.1
    Marko Myllynen
        A minor output format clarification
            A minor clarification for the locale output format which was
            brought up at
            https://sourceware.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=18516.

            For reference, see
            https://sourceware.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=18516
            http://pubs.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/9699919799/utilities/locale.html

        Add CONFORMING TO section

capget.2
    Julian Orth
        Clarify that hdrp->pid==0 is equivalent gettid() not getpid()

chroot.2
    Jann Horn
        chroot() is not intended for security; document attack
            It is unfortunate that this discourages this use of chroot(2)
            without pointing out alternative solutions - for example,
            OpenSSH and vsftpd both still rely on chroot(2) for security.

            Bind mounts should theoretically be usable as a replacement, but
            currently, they have a similar problem (CVE-2015-2925) that hasn't
            been fixed in ~6 months, so I'd rather not add it to the manpage
            as a solution before a fix lands.

clock_getres.2

execve.2
    Michael Kerrisk

_exit.2
    Michael Kerrisk
        Open stdio frames are not flushed, temporary files are deleted
            Many years ago, text was added to the page saying that it is
            implementation-dependent whether stdio streams are flushed and
            whether temporary are removed. In part, this change appears to
            be because POSIX.1-2001 added text related to this point.
            However, that seems to have been an error in POSIX, and the
            text was subsequently removed for POSIX.1-2008. See
            https://collaboration.opengroup.org/austin/interps/documents/9984/AI-085.txt

iopl.2

            These details are ancient, and long ago ceased to be relevant.

ioprio_set.2
    Michael Kerrisk  [Jens Axboe]
        Document meaning of ioprio==0

mlock.2
    Michael Kerrisk  [Mehdi Aqadjani Memar]
        Document another ENOMEM error case
            ENOMEM can occur if locking/unlocking in the middle of a region
            would increase the number of VMAs beyond the system limit (64k).

mmap.2
    Michal Hocko  [Eric B Munson]
        Clarify MAP_POPULATE
            David Rientjes has noticed that MAP_POPULATE wording might promise
            much more than the kernel actually provides and intends to provide.
            The primary usage of the flag is to pre-fault the range. There is
            no guarantee that no major faults will happen later on. The pages
            might have been reclaimed by the time the process tries to access
            them.
    Michal Hocko  [Eric B Munson]
        Clarify MAP_LOCKED semantics
            MAP_LOCKED had a subtly different semantic from mmap(2)+mlock(2)
            since it has been introduced.
            mlock(2) fails if the memory range cannot get populated to
            guarantee that no future major faults will happen on the range.
            mmap(MAP_LOCKED) on the other hand silently succeeds even if
            the range was populated only partially.

            Fixing this subtle difference in the kernel is rather awkward
            because the memory population happens after mm locks have been
            dropped and so the cleanup before returning failure (munlock)
            could operate on something else than the originally mapped area.

            E.g. speculative userspace page fault handler catching SEGV and
            doing mmap(fault_addr, MAP_FIXED|MAP_LOCKED) might discard portion
            of a racing mmap and lead to lost data. Although it is not clear
            whether such a usage would be valid, mmap page doesn't explicitly
            describe requirements for threaded applications so we cannot
            exclude this possibility.

            This patch makes the semantic of MAP_LOCKED explicit and suggests
            using mmap + mlock as the only way to guarantee no later major
            page faults.
    Michael Kerrisk
        ERRORS: point out that ENOMEM can occur even for munmap()

mprotect.2
    Michael Kerrisk
        Note ENOMEM error that can occur when we reach limit on maximum VMAs

open.2
read.2
write.2
    Michael Kerrisk  [Mike Hayward]

perf_event_open.2
    Vince Weaver  [Joerg Roedel]
        Exclude_host/exclude_guest clarification
            This patch relates to the exclude_host and exclude_guest bits added
            by the following commit:

               exclude_host, exclude_guest; Linux 3.2
                    commit a240f76165e6255384d4bdb8139895fac7988799
                    Author: Joerg Roedel <joerg.roedel@amd.com>
                    Date:   Wed Oct 5 14:01:16 2011 +0200

                        perf, core: Introduce attrs to count in either host or guest mode

            The updated manpage text clarifies that the "exclude_host" and
            "exclude_guest" perf_event_open() attr bits only apply in the
            context of a KVM environment and are currently x86 only.
    Vince Weaver
        Document PERF_SAMPLE_REGS_INTR
            This patch relates to the addition of PERF_SAMPLE_REGS_INTR
            support added in the following commit:

                perf_sample_regs_intr; Linux 3.19
                commit 60e2364e60e86e81bc6377f49779779e6120977f
                Author: Stephane Eranian <eranian@google.com>

                        perf: Add ability to sample machine state on interrupt

            The primary difference between PERF_SAMPLE_REGS_INTR and the
            existing PERF_SAMPLE_REGS_USER is that the new support will
            return kernel register values.  Also if precise_ip is
            set higher than 0 then the PEBS register state will be returned
            rather than the saved interrupt state.

            This patch incorporates feedback from Stephane Eranian and
            Andi Kleen.

prctl.2
seccomp.2
    Michael Kerrisk
        Clarify that SECCOMP_SET_MODE_STRICT disallows exit_group(2)
            These days, glibc implements _exit() as a wrapper around
            exit_group(2). (When seccomp was originally introduced, this was
            not the case.) Give the reader a clue that, despite what glibc is
            doing, what SECCOMP_SET_MODE_STRICT permits is the true _exit(2)
            system call, and not exit_group(2).

pread.2
read.2
readv.2
sendfile.2
write.2
    Michael Kerrisk
        Clarify that Linux limits transfers to a maximum of 0x7ffff000 bytes

            https://bugs.debian.org/630029.

    Michael Kerrisk
        Mention the use of the 'isolcpus' kernel boot option

sched_setattr.2
    Julian Orth
        Remove a const attribute
            The attr argument of sched_setattr was documented as const but the
            kernel will modify the size field of this struct if it contains an
            invalid value. See the documentation of the size field for details.

        Remove mention of IPv6 addresses, which are not supported
            As reported by Laszlo Ersek:

                gethostbyname(3) fails to resolve the IPv6 address "::1",
                but the manual page says: "If name is an IPv4 or IPv6 address,
                no lookup is performed and gethostbyname() simply copies name
                into the h_name field [...]".

            API which are used to implement rlogin and rsh.

            It came to my attention after working with QE on some automated
            internal testing that there were no good examples in the hosts.equiv
            manual page showing how the format was supposed to work for this
            file and for ~/.rhosts, worse the "format" line showed that there
            should be spaces between arguments when that would clearly lead
            to incorrect behaviour. In addition some things that the format
            allows you to write are just wrong like "-host -user" which makes
            no sense since the host is already rejected, and should be written
            as "host -user" instead. I added notes in the example to make it
            clear that "-host -user" is invalid.

            I fixed three things:

            (a) The format line.
            - Either +, or [-]hostname, or +@netgrp or -@netgrp.
            - Either +, or [-]username, or +@netgrp or -@netgrp.
            - You must specify something in the hostname portion so remove
              optional brackets.

            (b) Clarify language around credentials
            - If the host is not trusted you must provide credentials to
              the login system and that could be anything really and it
              depends on your configuration e.g. PAM or whatever IdM you have.

            (c) Provide real-world examples
            - Provide several real world examples and some corner case
              examples for how you would write something. Hopefully others
              can add examples as they see fit.

            It's probably a good idea to refer to locale(7) so that a reader

            detail.

        Remove the FIXME for timezone
            The timezone of LC_TIME is not in POSIX, only 6 (out of ~300)
            glibc locales define it, the glibc code comment below from
            glibc.git/programs/ld-time.c seems to suggest it's not a good
            idea, and there's been a proposal in upstream [1] to remove the
            existing timezone definitions from glibc locales so I think
            it's actually better to leave this one undocumented:

            /* XXX We don't perform any tests on the timezone value since this is
               simply useless, stupid $&$!@...  */

            1) https://sourceware.org/ml/libc-alpha/2015-06/msg00098.html

            Move the remaining LC_COLLATE FIXMEs together while at it.
    Marko Myllynen
        Fix country_isbn format
            Both plain numbers and Unicode code points are used in
            glibc locales but checking the code reveals that country_isbn
            is handled like the rest of its category expect for country_num
            which was clarified earlier.
    Marko Myllynen
        Sort according to the standard
            Sort the options so that those defined in POSIX are listed first,
            then followed by those defined in ISO/IEC TR 14652 in the order
            of common convention in many widely used glibc locales.

            Actual descriptions are unchanged.

            http://pubs.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/9699919799/basedefs/V1_chap07.html
    Marko Myllynen
        Refer to strftime(3) where appropriate
            The relationship between the locale time format syntax
            and strftime() cannot be considered as obvious.
    Marko Myllynen
        Document map "totitle"
            See e.g. locales/i18n for reference.
    Michael Kerrisk  [Marko Myllynen]
        Remove BUGS section saying man page is not complete
            To some degree, this is true of many pages. And anyway, this
            page is much better after recent work by Marko.

repertoiremap.5
    Marko Myllynen
        Symbolic names AKA mnemonics
            A long time ago in glibc, repertoire maps were used (but they
            were removed already in 2000), those mapping files were named
            as mnemonics, so "mnemonic" is a term that would almost
            certainly come up if somebody studies glibc side (perhaps even
            the related standards like ISO 9945 [which I don't have access
            to]) so I thought it's worth to mention to term in the man page
            to make sure we're talking about the same thing, otherwise
            someone might wonder is that something different or not.

            IOW, symbolic names and mnemonics are often used interchangeably,
            let's mention the other often used term in the page, too.

capabilities.7
    Michael Kerrisk
        CAP_SYS_ADMIN allows calling bpf(2)

packet.7

pty.7
    NeilBrown  [Peter Hurley]
        Clarify asynchronous nature of PTY I/O
            A PTY is not like a pipe - there may be delayed between data
            being written at one end and it being available at the other.

            This became particularly apparent after
                 commit f95499c3030f
                ("n_tty: Don't wait for buffer work in read() loop")

                Subject Re: [PATCH bisected regression] input_available_p()

rtld-audit.7
    Ben Woodard
        Use correct printf() specifier for pointer types
            In the example code you used %x rather than %p in the example
            code for an audit library. The problem is that it truncates the
            pointers on 64b platforms. So you get something like:

            la_symbind64(): symname = strrchr sym->st_value = 0x7f4b8a3f8960
            ndx = 222 flags = 0x0 refcook = 8b53e5c8 defcook = 8b537e30

            rather than:

            la_symbind64(): symname = fclose sym->st_value = 0x7fa452dd49b0
            ndx = 1135 flags = 0x0 refcook = 0x7fa453f395c8 defcook = 0x7fa453f32e30

            This has bitten me a handful of times when playing around with
            audit test libraries to investigate its behavior.

sched.7
    Michael Kerrisk
        Remove ancient, wildly optimistic prediction about future of RT patches
            It seems the patches were not merged by 2.6.30...

Global changes
--------------

Very many pages
    Michael Kerrisk
        Update CONFORMING TO section to reflect POSIX.1-2001 and POSIX.1-2008
        details. (By now, I believe all pages should be up to date with
        respect to appropriately mentioning POSIX.1-2001 and POSIX.1-2008.)

ldd.1
sprof.1
execve.2
dlopen.3
ld.so.8
    Michael Kerrisk
        Prefer "shared object" over "shared library"
            The man pages variously use "shared library" or "shared object".
            Try to more consistently use one term ("shared object"), while
            also pointing out on a few pages that the terms are synonymous.


Changes to individual pages
---------------------------

accept.2
    Michael Kerrisk
        Add mention of POSIX.1-2008 regarding EAGAIN vs EWOULDBLOCK

bpf.2
    Daniel Borkmann
        Various updates/follow-ups to address some fixmes
            A couple of follow-ups to the bpf(2) man-page, besides others:

             * Description of map data types
             * Explanation on eBPF tail calls and program arrays
             * Paragraph on tc holding ref of the eBPF program in the kernel
             * Updated ASCII image with tc ingress and egress invocations
             * __sync_fetch_and_add() and example usage mentioned on arrays
             * minor reword on the licensing and other minor fixups

execve.2
    Michael Kerrisk
        Reword text on POSIX and #!

io_getevents.2
    Michael Kerrisk
        Note return value on interruption by a signal handler
    Michael Kerrisk
        Clarify details of return value for timeout-expired case
    Michael Kerrisk

mmap.2
    Michael Kerrisk
        Note that 'length' need not be a page-size multiple for munmap()
    Michael Kerrisk  [David Rientjes, David Rientjes, Mike Kravetz]
        Describe mmap()/munmap() argument requirements for huge-page mappings
    Michael Kerrisk
        Move discussion of timestamps to NOTES
            A straight move; no changes to the content.
            This content is better placed in NOTES.

seccomp.2
    Michael Kerrisk
        SEE ALSO: mention libseccomp pages
        SEE ALSO: add scmp_sys_resolver(1)

sigaction.2
    Michael Kerrisk
        Correct the list of flags that were added in POSIX.1-2001

socketpair.2
    Michael Kerrisk  [Goswin von Brederlow]
        Clarify use of SOCK_* flags in 'type' argument
            See http://bugs.debian.org/794217

atexit.3
    Michael Kerrisk
        SEE ALSO: add dlopen(3)

clock_getcpuclockid.3
    Michael Kerrisk
        Improve wording of EPERM error
            It's imprecise to say that this is an "optional" error
            in POSIX.1.

dl_iterate_phdr.3
    Michael Kerrisk
        Note that 'size' allows callback() to discover structure extensions
    Michael Kerrisk
        SEE ALSO: add dladdr(3)
    Michael Kerrisk
        CONFORMING TO: note that this function appears on some other systems

fseeko.3
    Michael Kerrisk
        Remove crufty NOTES section
            This ancient System V detail is unneeded.

getutent.3
    Michael Kerrisk
        Mention POSIX.1-2008 for the "utmpx" functions

iconv_close.3
iconv_open.3
    Michael Kerrisk
        CONFORMING TO: change "UNIX98" to "SUSv2"

malloc.3
    Michael Kerrisk
        Change "UNIX 98" to "SUSv2"

mktemp.3
    Gleb Fotengauer-Malinovskiy
        Reference mkdtemp(3) in addition to mkstemp(3)
            Mention mkdtemp(3) as another secure alternative to mktemp(3).

            See also https://sourceware.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=2898.

mq_receive.3
mq_send.3
    Michael Kerrisk
        Clarify discussion of 'timeout'
            In particular, remove the word 'ceiling', which falsely
            suggests that the call might return prematurely.

nl_langinfo.3
    Michael Kerrisk
        Explicitly describe the return value on success
    Michael Kerrisk
        POSIX specifies that the caller may not modify the returned string
    Michael Kerrisk
        Enhance RETURN VALUE description
            Note some further cases where returned string may be
            invalidated or overwritten.

perror.3
    Michael Kerrisk
        Reformat CONFORMING to information
    Michael Kerrisk
        Note that 'sys_errlist' and 'sys_nerr' are not in POSIX.1

posix_openpt.3
    Michael Kerrisk
        Reword text regarding systems that don't have posix_openpt()

printf.3
    Michael Kerrisk
        CONFORMING TO: update details for dprintf() and vdprintf()

setlogmask.3
    Michael Kerrisk
        Remove useless statement in CONFORMING TO
            Saying that the description in PSOX.1-2001 is flawed,
            without saying what the fla is, is not helpful.
            (And no, I don't know what the flaw is.)

shm_open.3
    Michael Kerrisk
        Add POSIX.1-2008 details regarding group ID of new shared memory object

strfmon.3
    Michael Kerrisk
        Fix erroneous CONFORMING to
            strfmon() is in POSIX.1.

fanotify.7
    Heinrich Schuchardt
        Clarify effects of file moves
            If files or directories are moved to other mounts, the inode is
            deleted. Fanotify marks are lost.

mq_overview.7
    Michael Kerrisk
        Remove unneeded CONFORMING TO section

nptl.7
    Michael Kerrisk  [Nicholas Miell]
        Note that i386 and x86-64 binaries can't share mutexes

Changes to individual pages
---------------------------

mremap.2
    Eric B Munson  [Michal Hocko]
        Add note about mremap() with locked areas
            When mremap() is used to move or expand a mapping that is locked
            with mlock() or equivalent it will attempt to populate the new
            area.  However, like mmap(MAP_LOCKED), mremap() will not fail if
            the area cannot be populated.  Also like mmap(MAP_LOCKED) this
            might come as a surprise to users and should be noted.
open.2
    Michael Kerrisk  [David Drysdale]
        Remove accidental mention of O_TTY_INIT
            An earlier edit mentioned O_TTY_INIT as a file creation flag.
            That's true, according POSIX, but Linux does not implement
            this flag, so remove mention of it.

pipe.2
    Michael Kerrisk
        SEE ALSO: add splice(2)

prctl.2
    Michael Kerrisk
        Reorder options alphabetically
            Employ a pseudo-alphabetical order, ordering options after removal
            of any "PR_", "PR_SET_", or "PR_GET" prefix.
    Michael Kerrisk
        Fix alphabetical misplacements in ERRORS

ptrace.2
    Tycho Andersen
        Document PTRACE_O_SUSPEND_SECCOMP flag
    Michael Kerrisk
        Document /proc/sys/kernel/yama/ptrace_scope
    Michael Kerrisk
        Note that PTRACE_ATTACH cannot be applied to nondumpable processes
    Michael Kerrisk
        SEE ALSO: add prctl(2)

reboot.2
    Casper Ti. Vector
        1-argument reboot() is also provided by alternative libc

seccomp.2
    Michael Kerrisk
        Describe use of 'instruction_pointer' data field
    Michael Kerrisk  [Kees Cook]
        Note why all filters in a set are executed even after SECCOMP_RET_KILL

signalfd.2
    Michael Kerrisk
        Describe semantics with respect to SCM_RIGHTS

syscalls.2
    Michael Kerrisk
        Add mlock(2)
    Michael Kerrisk
        Add userfaultfd()

daemon.3
    Michael Kerrisk  [Johannes Stüttgen]
        Note that daemon() is buggy with respect to controlling tty acquisition

dirfd.3
    Jonathan Wakely
        Remove outdated NOTES
            As stated in the SYNOPSIS, since glibc 2.10 this function is also
            declared by the relevant X/Open and POSIX macros.

dlopen.3
    Michael Kerrisk
        Make it more explicit that LD_BIND_NOW overrides RTLD_LAZY
    Michael Kerrisk  [Florian Weimer]
        Correct the pathname used in EXAMPLE
            Quoting Florian:

                This does not work because libm.so can be a linker script:

                       handle = dlopen("libm.so", RTLD_LAZY);

                The proper way to do this is to include <gnu/lib-names.h>
                and use LIBM_SO.

            See https://bugzilla.kernel.org/show_bug.cgi?id=108821
    Michael Kerrisk
        Include a shell session showing build/run in EXAMPLE
    Michael Kerrisk
        Change arguments to main() to "void" in EXAMPLE

fgetgrent.3
    Zeng Linggang
        ATTRIBUTES: Note function that is not thread-safe

fgetpwent.3
    Zeng Linggang
        ATTRIBUTES: Note function that is not thread-safe

getauxval.3
    Michael Kerrisk
        Add some details for AT_SECURE

getspnam.3
    Zeng Linggang
        ATTRIBUTES: Note functions that are/aren't thread-safe

mallinfo.3
    Zeng Linggang
        ATTRIBUTES: Note function that is not thread-safe

mallopt.3
    Carlos O'Donell
        Document M_ARENA_TEST and M_ARENA_MAX

posix_fallocate.3
    Michael Kerrisk
        Clarify text relating to MT-safety
    Carlos O'Donell
        Mention glibc emulation caveats

termios.3
    Olivier TARTROU
        Add missing details on behaviour of PARMRK
            For a serial terminal, with a specific configuration, input bytes
            with value 0377 are passed to the program as two bytes, 0377 0377.

tty_ioctl.4
    Michael Kerrisk  [Peter Hurley]
        Note that TIOCTTYGSTRUCT went away in Linux 2.5.67

core.5
    Ross Zwisler
        Add info about DAX coredump filtering flags
            Kernel 4.4 added two new core dump filtering flags,
            MMF_DUMP_DAX_PRIVATE and MMF_DUMP_DAX_SHARED.

            These flags allow us to explicitly filter DAX mappings.
            This is desirable because DAX mappings, like hugetlb
            mappings, have the potential to be very large.

nsswitch.conf.5
    Nikola Forró
        Add list of files being read when "files" service is used
            This is not mentioned anywhere. Users can assume that the file
            being read is something like /etc/$DATABASE, but that's not
            always the case. It's better to explicitly specify which
            file is read for each respective database.  The list of
            files was acquired from glibc source code.

proc.5
    Heinrich Schuchardt  [Michael Kerrisk]
        Add details for threads-max
            Add detail information for threads-max.
            The checks for minimum and maximum values exist since kernel 4.1.
            https://lkml.org/lkml/2015/3/15/96
    Heinrich Schuchardt
        /proc/sys: Describe whitespace characters
    Michael Kerrisk
        Document 'CapAmb' in /proc/PID/status
    Michael Kerrisk
        Add reference to ptrace(2) for /proc/sys/kernel/yama/ptrace_scope

aio.7
    Michael Kerrisk  [Meikun Wang]
        Add missing include file, <fcntl.h>, to example program

mq_overview.7
    Michael Kerrisk  [Arto Bendiken]
        Document QSIZE bug that appeared in 3.5 and was fixed in 4.2

path_resolution.7
    Michael Kerrisk
        Clarify recursive resolution of symlinks and note limits

pipe.7
    Michael Kerrisk
        SEE ALSO: add splice(2)

rtld-audit.7
    Namhyung Kim
        Fix (typo) error in la_pltenter() description
            s/la_pltenter()/la_pltexit()/

            la_pltenter() is called regardless of the value of
            framesizep but la_pltexit() is called only if la_pltenter()
            returns with non-zero framesizep set.  I spent long time to
            figure out why la_pltexit() is not called at all.

signal.7
    Michael Kerrisk  [Michael Hocko]
        Note async-signal-safe functions added by POSIX.1-2008 TC1

tcp.7
    Daniel Borkmann  [Michael Kerrisk]
        Improve paragraphs on tcp_ecn and add tcp_ecn_fallback bullet
            Improve description of tcp_ecn, fix the RFC number and it's
            not a boolean anymore since long time, and add a description
            for tcp_ecn_fallback.

            See also kernel doc under Documentation/networking/ip-sysctl.txt
            on tcp_ecn and tcp_ecn_fallback.

ld.so.8
    Michael Kerrisk
        LD_POINTER_GUARD has been removed in glibc 2.23
    Michael Kerrisk
        Describe secure-execution mode
    Michael Kerrisk  [Maria Guseva]
        Replace mentions of set-UID/set-GID programs with secure-execution mode
            Inspired by a patch from Maria Guseva.
    Maria Guseva  [Silvan Jegen]
        LD_DEBUG is effective in secure-execution mode if /etc/suid-debug exists
