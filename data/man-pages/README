This package contains Linux man pages for sections
2, 3, 4, 5, and 7. Some more information is given in the
`Announce' file.

Install by copying to your favourite location.
"make install" will just copy them to /usr/share/man/man[1-8].
To install to a path different from /usr use
"make install prefix=/install/path".
"make" will move the pages from this package that are older than
the already installed ones to a subdirectory `not_installed',
then remove old versions (compressed or not),
compress the pages, and copy them to /usr/share/man/man[1-8].


Note that you may have to remove preformatted pages.

Note that sometimes these pages are duplicates of pages
also distributed in other packages. This has been reported
about dlclose.3, dlerror.3, dlopen.3, dlsym.3 (found in ld.so),
about resolver.3, resolv.conf.5 (found in bind-utils),
and about passwd.5, and mailaddr.7. Be careful not to
overwrite more up-to-date versions.
Reports on further duplicates are welcome.
Formerly present and now removed duplicates:
 exports.5 (found in nfs-server-2.2*),
 fstab.5, nfs.5 (found in util-linux-2.12*),
 lilo.8, lilo.conf.5 (found in lilo-21.6*).

Copyrights: These man pages come under various copyrights.
All pages are freely distributable when the nroff source is included.
