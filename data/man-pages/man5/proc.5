.TH PROC 5 2015-12-05 "Linux" "Linux Programmer's Manual"
.SH NAME
proc \- process information pseudo-filesystem
.SH DESCRIPTION
The
.I proc
filesystem is a pseudo-filesystem which provides an interface to
kernel data structures.
It is commonly mounted at
.IR /proc .
Most of it is read-only, but some files allow kernel variables to be
changed.
.SS Mount options
The
.I proc
filesystem supports the following mount options:
.TP
.BR hidepid "=\fIn\fP (since Linux 3.3)"
.\" commit 0499680a42141d86417a8fbaa8c8db806bea1201
This option controls who can access the information in
.IR /proc/[pid]
directories.
The argument,
.IR n ,
is one of the following values:
.RS
.TP 4
0
Everybody may access all
.IR /proc/[pid]
directories.
This is the traditional behavior,
and the default if this mount option is not specified.
.TP
1
Users may not access files and subdirectories inside any
.IR /proc/[pid]
directories but their own (the
.IR /proc/[pid]
directories themselves remain visible).
Sensitive files such as
.IR /proc/[pid]/cmdline
and
.IR /proc/[pid]/status
are now protected against other users.
This makes it impossible to learn whether any user is running a
specific program
(so long as the program doesn't otherwise reveal itself by its behavior).
.\" As an additional bonus, since
.\" .IR /proc/[pid]/cmdline
.\" is unaccessible for other users,
.\" poorly written programs passing sensitive information via
.\" program arguments are now protected against local eavesdroppers.
.TP
2
As for mode 1, but in addition the
.IR /proc/[pid]
directories belonging to other users become invisible.
This means that
.IR /proc/[pid]
entries can no longer be used to discover the PIDs on the system.
This doesn't hide the fact that a process with a specific PID value exists
(it can be learned by other means, for example, by "kill -0 $PID"),
but it hides a process's UID and GID,
which could otherwise be learned by employing
.BR stat (2)
on a
.IR /proc/[pid]
directory.
This greatly complicates an attacker's task of gathering
information about running processes (e.g., discovering whether
some daemon is running with elevated privileges,
whether another user is running some sensitive program,
whether other users are running any program at all, and so on).
.RE
.TP
.BR gid "=\fIgid\fP (since Linux 3.3)"
.\" commit 0499680a42141d86417a8fbaa8c8db806bea1201
Specifies the ID of a group whose members are authorized to
learn process information otherwise prohibited by
.BR hidepid
(ie/e/, users in this group behave as though
.I /proc
was mounted with
.IR hidepid=0 .
This group should be used instead of approaches such as putting
nonroot users into the
.BR sudoers (5)
file.
.SS Files and directories
The following list describes many of the files and directories under the
.I /proc
hierarchy.
.PD 1
.TP
.I /proc/[pid]
There is a numerical subdirectory for each running process; the
subdirectory is named by the process ID.
Each such subdirectory contains the following
pseudo-files and directories.
.TP
.I /proc/[pid]/attr

.\" Subject: [RFC][PATCH] Process Attribute API for Security Modules
.\" Date:    08 Apr 2003 16:17:52 -0400
.\"
.\"	http://www.nsa.gov/research/_files/selinux/papers/module/x362.shtml
.\"
The files in this directory provide an API for security modules.
The contents of this directory are files that can be read and written
in order to set security-related attributes.
This directory was added to support SELinux,
but the intention was that the API be general enough to support
other security modules.
For the purpose of explanation,
examples of how SELinux uses these files are provided below.

This directory is present only if the kernel was configured with
.BR CONFIG_SECURITY .
.TP
.IR /proc/[pid]/attr/current " (since Linux 2.6.0)"
The contents of this file represent the current
security attributes of the process.

In SELinux, this file is used to get the security context of a process.
Prior to Linux 2.6.11, this file could not be used to set the security
context (a write was always denied), since SELinux limited process security
transitions to
.BR execve (2)
(see the description of
.IR /proc/[pid]/attr/exec ,
below).
Since Linux 2.6.11, SELinux lifted this restriction and began supporting
"set" operations via writes to this node if authorized by policy,
although use of this operation is only suitable for applications that are
trusted to maintain any desired separation between the old and new security
contexts.
Prior to Linux 2.6.28, SELinux did not allow threads within a
multi-threaded process to set their security context via this node
as it would yield an inconsistency among the security contexts of the
threads sharing the same memory space.
Since Linux 2.6.28, SELinux lifted
this restriction and began supporting "set" operations for threads within
a multithreaded process if the new security context is bounded by the old
security context, where the bounded relation is defined in policy and
guarantees that the new security context has a subset of the permissions
of the old security context.
Other security modules may choose to support "set" operations via
writes to this node.
.TP
.IR /proc/[pid]/attr/exec " (since Linux 2.6.0)"
This file represents the attributes to assign to the
process upon a subsequent
.BR execve (2).

In SELinux,
this is needed to support role/domain transitions, and
.BR execve (2)
is the preferred point to make such transitions because it offers better
control over the initialization of the process in the new security label
and the inheritance of state.
In SELinux, this attribute is reset on
.BR execve (2)
so that the new program reverts to the default behavior for any
.BR execve (2)
calls that it may make.
In SELinux, a process can set
only its own
.I /proc/[pid]/attr/exec
attribute.
.TP
.IR /proc/[pid]/attr/fscreate " (since Linux 2.6.0)"
This file represents the attributes to assign to files
created by subsequent calls to
.BR open (2),
.BR mkdir (2),
.BR symlink (2),
and
.BR mknod (2)

SELinux employs this file to support creation of a file
(using the aforementioned system calls)
in a secure state,
so that there is no risk of inappropriate access being obtained
between the time of creation and the time that attributes are set.
In SELinux, this attribute is reset on
.BR execve (2),
so that the new program reverts to the default behavior for
any file creation calls it may make, but the attribute will persist
across multiple file creation calls within a program unless it is
explicitly reset.
In SELinux, a process can set only its own
.IR /proc/[pid]/attr/fscreate
attribute.
.TP
.IR /proc/[pid]/attr/prev " (since Linux 2.6.0)"
This file contains the security context of the process before the last
.BR execve (2);
that is, the previous value of
.IR /proc/[pid]/attr/current .
.TP
.IR /proc/[pid]/attr/keycreate " (since Linux 2.6.18)"
.\" commit 4eb582cf1fbd7b9e5f466e3718a59c957e75254e
.\" /Documentation/keys.txt
If a process writes a security context into this file,
all subsequently created keys
.RB ( add_key (2))
will be labeled with this context.
For further information, see the kernel source file
.IR Documentation/keys.txt .
.TP
.IR /proc/[pid]/attr/socketcreate " (since Linux 2.6.18)"
.\" commit 42c3e03ef6b298813557cdb997bd6db619cd65a2

This is a write-only file, writable only by owner of the process.

The following values may be written to the file:
.RS
.TP
1 (since Linux 2.6.22)
.\" Internally: CLEAR_REFS_ALL
Reset the PG_Referenced and ACCESSED/YOUNG

(Before kernel 2.6.32, writing any nonzero value to this file
had this effect.)
.TP

.\" Internally: CLEAR_REFS_ANON
Reset the PG_Referenced and ACCESSED/YOUNG

.TP
3 (since Linux 2.6.32)
.\" Internally: CLEAR_REFS_MAPPED
Reset the PG_Referenced and ACCESSED/YOUNG
bits for all file-mapped pages associated with the process.
.RE
.IP
Clearing the PG_Referenced and ACCESSED/YOUNG bits provides a method
to measure approximately how much memory a process is using.
One first inspects the values in the "Referenced" fields
for the VMAs shown in
.IR /proc/[pid]/smaps
to get an idea of the memory footprint of the
process.
One then clears the PG_Referenced and ACCESSED/YOUNG bits
and, after some measured time interval,
once again inspects the values in the "Referenced" fields
to get an idea of the change in memory footprint of the
process during the measured interval.
If one is interested only in inspecting the selected mapping types,
then the value 2 or 3 can be used instead of 1.

A further value can be written to affect a different bit:
.RS
.TP
4 (since Linux 3.11)
Clear the soft-dirty bit for all the pages associated with the process.
.\" Internally: CLEAR_REFS_SOFT_DIRTY
This is used (in conjunction with
.IR /proc/[pid]/pagemap )
by the check-point restore system to discover which pages of a process
have been dirtied since the file
.IR /proc/[pid]/clear_refs
was written to.
.RE
.IP
Writing any value to
.IR /proc/[pid]/clear_refs
other than those listed above has no effect.

The
.IR /proc/[pid]/clear_refs
file is present only if the
.B CONFIG_PROC_PAGE_MONITOR
kernel configuration option is enabled.
.TP
.I /proc/[pid]/cmdline
This read-only file holds the complete command line for the process,
unless the process is a zombie.
.\" In 2.3.26, this also used to be true if the process was swapped out.
In the latter case, there is nothing in this file:
that is, a read on this file will return 0 characters.
The command-line arguments appear in this file as a set of
strings separated by null bytes (\(aq\\0\(aq),
with a further null byte after the last string.
.TP

.\" commit 4614a696bd1c3a9af3a08f0e5874830a85b889d4
This file exposes the process's
.I comm
value\(emthat is, the command name associated with the process.
Different threads in the same process may have different
.I comm
values, accessible via
.IR /proc/[pid]/task/[tid]/comm .
A thread may modify its
.I comm
value, or that of any of other thread in the same thread group (see
the discussion of
.B CLONE_THREAD
in
.BR clone (2)),
by writing to the file
.IR /proc/self/task/[tid]/comm .
Strings longer than
.B TASK_COMM_LEN
(16) characters are silently truncated.

This file provides a superset of the
.BR prctl (2)
.B PR_SET_NAME
and
.B PR_GET_NAME
operations, and is employed by
.BR pthread_setname_np (3)
when used to rename threads other than the caller.
.TP
.IR /proc/[pid]/coredump_filter " (since Linux 2.6.23)"
See
.BR core (5).

.\" and/proc/[pid]/task/[tid]/cpuset
See
.BR cpuset (7).
.TP
.I /proc/[pid]/cwd
This is a symbolic link to the current working directory of the process.
To find out the current working directory of process 20,
for instance, you can do this:

.in +4n
.nf
.RB "$" " cd /proc/20/cwd; /bin/pwd"
.fi
.in

Note that the
.I pwd
command is often a shell built-in, and might
not work properly.
In
.BR bash (1),
you may use
.IR "pwd\ \-P" .

.\" The following was still true as at kernel 2.6.13
In a multithreaded process, the contents of this symbolic link
are not available if the main thread has already terminated
(typically by calling
.BR pthread_exit (3)).
.TP
.I /proc/[pid]/environ
This file contains the environment for the process.
The entries are separated by null bytes (\(aq\\0\(aq),
and there may be a null byte at the end.
Thus, to print out the environment of process 1, you would do:
.in +4n
.nf

.ft CW
.RB "$" " strings /proc/1/environ"
.fi
.ft P
.in
.TP
.I /proc/[pid]/exe
Under Linux 2.2 and later, this file is a symbolic link
containing the actual pathname of the executed command.
This symbolic link can be dereferenced normally; attempting to open
it will open the executable.
You can even type
.I /proc/[pid]/exe
to run another copy of the same executable that is being run by
process [pid].
If the pathname has been unlinked, the symbolic link will contain the
string \(aq(deleted)\(aq appended to the original pathname.
.\" The following was still true as at kernel 2.6.13
In a multithreaded process, the contents of this symbolic link
are not available if the main thread has already terminated
(typically by calling
.BR pthread_exit (3)).

Under Linux 2.0 and earlier,
.I /proc/[pid]/exe
is a pointer to the binary which was executed,
and appears as a symbolic link.
A
.BR readlink (2)
call on this file under Linux 2.0 returns a string in the format:

    [device]:inode

For example, [0301]:1502 would be inode 1502 on device major 03 (IDE,
MFM, etc. drives) minor 01 (first partition on the first drive).

.BR find (1)
with the
.I \-inum
option can be used to locate the file.
.TP
.I /proc/[pid]/fd/
This is a subdirectory containing one entry for each file which the
process has open, named by its file descriptor, and which is a
symbolic link to the actual file.
Thus, 0 is standard input, 1 standard output, 2 standard error, and so on.

For file descriptors for pipes and sockets,
the entries will be symbolic links whose content is the
file type with the inode.
A
.BR readlink (2)
call on this file returns a string in the format:

    type:[inode]

For example,
.I socket:[2248868]
will be a socket and its inode is 2248868.
For sockets, that inode can be used to find more information
in one of the files under
.IR /proc/net/ .

For file descriptors that have no corresponding inode
(e.g., file descriptors produced by
.BR epoll_create (2),
.BR eventfd (2),
.BR inotify_init (2),
.BR signalfd (2),
and
.BR timerfd (2)),
the entry will be a symbolic link with contents of the form

    anon_inode:<file-type>

In some cases, the
.I file-type
is surrounded by square brackets.

For example, an epoll file descriptor will have a symbolic link
whose content is the string
.IR "anon_inode:[eventpoll]" .

.\"The following was still true as at kernel 2.6.13
In a multithreaded process, the contents of this directory
are not available if the main thread has already terminated
(typically by calling
.BR pthread_exit (3)).

Programs that will take a filename as a command-line argument,
but will not take input from standard input if no argument is supplied,
or that write to a file named as a command-line argument,
but will not send their output to standard output
if no argument is supplied, can nevertheless be made to use
standard input or standard out using
.IR /proc/[pid]/fd .
For example, assuming that
.I \-i
is the flag designating an input file and
.I \-o
is the flag designating an output file:
.in +4n
.nf

.RB "$" " foobar \-i /proc/self/fd/0 \-o /proc/self/fd/1 ..."
.fi
.in

and you have a working filter.
.\" The following is not true in my tests (MTK):
.\" Note that this will not work for
.\" programs that seek on their files, as the files in the fd directory
.\" are not seekable.

.I /proc/self/fd/N
is approximately the same as
.I /dev/fd/N
in some UNIX and UNIX-like systems.
Most Linux MAKEDEV scripts symbolically link
.I /dev/fd
to
.IR /proc/self/fd ,
in fact.

Most systems provide symbolic links
.IR /dev/stdin ,
.IR /dev/stdout ,
and
.IR /dev/stderr ,
which respectively link to the files
.IR 0 ,
.IR 1 ,
and
.IR 2
in
.IR /proc/self/fd .
Thus the example command above could be written as:

.IR /proc/[pid]/fdinfo/ " (since Linux 2.6.22)"
This is a subdirectory containing one entry for each file which the
process has open, named by its file descriptor.
The files in this directory are readable only by the owner of the process.
The contents of each file can be read to obtain information
about the corresponding file descriptor.
The content depends on the type of file referred to by the
corresponding file descriptor.

For regular files and directories, we see something like:
.in +4n

pos:    1000
flags:  01002002
mnt_id: 21
.fi
.in

The
.I pos
field is a decimal number showing the file offset.
The
.I flags
field is an octal number that displays the
file access mode and file status flags (see
.BR open (2)).
The
.I mnt_id
field, present since Linux 3.15,
.\" commit 49d063cb353265c3af701bab215ac438ca7df36d
is the ID of the mount point containing this file.
See the description of
.IR /proc/[pid]/mountinfo .

For eventfd file descriptors (see
.BR eventfd (2)),
we see the following fields:

.in +4n
.nf
pos:	0
flags:	02
mnt_id:	10
eventfd-count:               40
.fi
.in

.I eventfd-count
is the current value of the eventfd counter, in hexadecimal.

For epoll file descriptors (see
.BR epoll (7)),
we see the following fields:

.in +4n
.nf
pos:	0

tfd:        7 events:       19 data: 74253d2500000007
.fi
.in

Each of the lines beginning
.I tfd
describes one of the file descriptors being monitored via
the epoll file descriptor (see
.BR epoll_ctl (2)
for some details).
The
.IR tfd
field is the number of the file descriptor.
The
.I events
field is a hexadecimal mask of the events being monitored for this file
descriptor.
The
.I data
field is the data value associated with this file descriptor.

For signalfd file descriptors (see
.BR signalfd (2)),
we see the following fields:

.in +4n
.nf
pos:	0

.RS
.TP
.IR rchar ": characters read"
The number of bytes which this task has caused to be read from storage.
This is simply the sum of bytes which this process passed to
.BR read (2)
and similar system calls.
It includes things such as terminal I/O and
is unaffected by whether or not actual
physical disk I/O was required (the read might have been satisfied from
pagecache).
.TP
.IR wchar ": characters written"
The number of bytes which this task has caused, or shall cause to be written
to disk.
Similar caveats apply here as with
.IR rchar .
.TP
.IR syscr ": read syscalls"
Attempt to count the number of read I/O operations\(emthat is,
system calls such as
.BR read (2)
and
.BR pread (2).
.TP
.IR syscw ": write syscalls"
Attempt to count the number of write I/O operations\(emthat is,
system calls such as
.BR write (2)
and
.BR pwrite (2).
.TP
.IR read_bytes ": bytes read"
Attempt to count the number of bytes which this process really did cause to
be fetched from the storage layer.
This is accurate for block-backed filesystems.
.TP
.IR write_bytes ": bytes written"
Attempt to count the number of bytes which this process caused to be sent to
the storage layer.
.TP
.IR cancelled_write_bytes :
The big inaccuracy here is truncate.
If a process writes 1MB to a file and then deletes the file,
it will in fact perform no writeout.
But it will have been accounted as having caused 1MB of write.
In other words: this field represents the number of bytes which this process
caused to not happen, by truncating pagecache.
A task can cause "negative" I/O too.
If this task truncates some dirty pagecache,
some I/O which another task has been accounted for
(in its
.IR write_bytes )
will not be happening.

This subdirectory contains entries corresponding to memory-mapped
files (see
.BR mmap (2)).
Entries are named by memory region start and end
address pair (expressed as hexadecimal numbers),
and are symbolic links to the mapped files themselves.
Here is an example, with the output wrapped and reformatted to fit on an 80-column display:
.in +4n

Although these entries are present for memory regions that were
mapped with the
.BR MAP_FILE
flag, the way anonymous shared memory (regions created with the

is implemented in Linux
means that such regions also appear on this directory.

The
.I address
field is the address space in the process that the mapping occupies.
The
.I perms
field is a set of permissions:

.nf
.in +5
r = read
w = write
x = execute
s = shared
p = private (copy on write)
.fi
.in

The
.I offset
field is the offset into the file/whatever;
.I dev
is the device

.I inode
is the inode on that device.
0 indicates that no inode is associated with the memory region,
as would be the case with BSS (uninitialized data).

The
.I pathname
field will usually be the file that is backing the mapping.
For ELF files,
you can easily coordinate with the
.I offset

.RI ( "readelf\ \-l" ).

.TP
.IR /proc/[pid]/oom_score_adj " (since Linux 2.6.36)"
.\" Text taken from 3.7 Documentation/filesystems/proc.txt
This file can be used to adjust the badness heuristic used to select which
process gets killed in out-of-memory conditions.

The badness heuristic assigns a value to each candidate task ranging from 0
(never kill) to 1000 (always kill) to determine which process is targeted.
The units are roughly a proportion along that range of
allowed memory the process may allocate from,
based on an estimation of its current memory and swap use.
For example, if a task is using all allowed memory,
its badness score will be 1000.
If it is using half of its allowed memory, its score will be 500.

There is an additional factor included in the badness score: root
processes are given 3% extra memory over other tasks.

The amount of "allowed" memory depends on the context
in which the OOM-killer was called.
If it is due to the memory assigned to the allocating task's cpuset
being exhausted,
the allowed memory represents the set of mems assigned to that
cpuset (see
.BR cpuset (7)).
If it is due to a mempolicy's node(s) being exhausted,
the allowed memory represents the set of mempolicy nodes.
If it is due to a memory limit (or swap limit) being reached,
the allowed memory is that configured limit.
Finally, if it is due to the entire system being out of memory, the
allowed memory represents all allocatable resources.

The value of
.I oom_score_adj
is added to the badness score before it
is used to determine which task to kill.
Acceptable values range from \-1000
(OOM_SCORE_ADJ_MIN) to +1000 (OOM_SCORE_ADJ_MAX).
This allows user space to control the preference for OOM-killing,
ranging from always preferring a certain
task or completely disabling it from OOM killing.
The lowest possible value, \-1000, is
equivalent to disabling OOM-killing entirely for that task,
since it will always report a badness score of 0.

Consequently, it is very simple for user space to define
the amount of memory to consider for each task.
Setting a
.I oom_score_adj
value of +500, for example,
is roughly equivalent to allowing the remainder of tasks sharing the
same system, cpuset, mempolicy, or memory controller resources
to use at least 50% more memory.
A value of \-500, on the other hand, would be roughly
equivalent to discounting 50% of the task's
allowed memory from being considered as scoring against the task.

For backward compatibility with previous kernels,
.I /proc/[pid]/oom_adj
can still be used to tune the badness score.
Its value is
scaled linearly with
.IR oom_score_adj .

Writing to
.IR /proc/[pid]/oom_score_adj
or
.IR /proc/[pid]/oom_adj
will change the other with its scaled value.

The first of these lines shows the same information as is displayed
for the mapping in
.IR /proc/[pid]/maps .
The remaining lines show the size of the mapping,
the amount of the mapping that is currently resident in RAM ("Rss"),
the process' proportional share of this mapping ("Pss"),
the number of clean and dirty shared pages in the mapping,
and the number of clean and dirty private pages in the mapping.
"Referenced" indicates the amount of memory currently marked as
referenced or accessed.
"Anonymous" shows the amount of memory
that does not belong to any file.
"Swap" shows how much
would-be-anonymous memory is also used, but out on swap.

The "KernelPageSize" entry is the page size used by the kernel to back a VMA.
This matches the size used by the MMU in the majority of cases.
However, one counter-example occurs on PPC64 kernels
whereby a kernel using 64K as a base page size may still use 4K
pages for the MMU on older processors.
To distinguish, this
patch reports "MMUPageSize" as the page size used by the MMU.

The "Locked" indicates whether the mapping is locked in memory
or not.

"VmFlags" field represents the kernel flags associated with
the particular virtual memory area in two letter encoded manner.
The codes are the following:

    rd  - readable
    wr  - writable
    ex  - executable
    sh  - shared
    mr  - may read
    mw  - may write

(18) \fIpriority\fP \ %ld
(Explanation for Linux 2.6)
For processes running a real-time scheduling policy
.RI ( policy
below; see
.BR sched_setscheduler (2)),
this is the negated scheduling priority, minus one;
that is, a number in the range \-2 to \-100,
corresponding to real-time priorities 1 to 99.
For processes running under a non-real-time scheduling policy,
this is the raw nice value
.RB ( setpriority (2))
as represented in the kernel.
The kernel stores nice values as numbers
in the range 0 (high) to 39 (low),
corresponding to the user-visible nice range of \-20 to 19.

Before Linux 2.6, this was a scaled value based on
the scheduler weighting given to this process.
.\" And back in kernel 1.2 days things were different again.
.TP
(19) \fInice\fP \ %ld
The nice value (see

Number of threads in this process (since Linux 2.6).
Before kernel 2.6, this field was hard coded to 0 as a placeholder
for an earlier removed field.
.TP
(21) \fIitrealvalue\fP \ %ld
The time in jiffies before the next
.B SIGALRM

Since kernel 2.6.17, this field is no longer maintained,
and is hard coded as 0.
.TP
(22) \fIstarttime\fP \ %llu

This file exposes the system call number and argument registers for the
system call currently being executed by the process,
followed by the values of the stack pointer and program counter registers.
The values of all six argument registers are exposed,
although most system calls use fewer registers.

If the process is blocked, but not in a system call,
then the file displays \-1 in place of the system call number,
followed by just the values of the stack pointer and program counter.

file in the parent directory, since all of the threads in a process
share a working directory).
For attributes that are distinct for each thread,

.BR timer_create (2);
rather, it is the same kernel-internal ID that is available via the
.I si_timerid
field of the
.IR siginfo_t
structure (see
.BR sigaction (2)).
.TP
.I signal
This is the signal number that this timer uses to deliver notifications
followed by a slash, and then the
.I sigev_value
value supplied to the signal handler.
Valid only for timers that notify via a signal.
.TP
.I notify
The part before the slash specifies the mechanism
that this timer uses to deliver notifications,
and is one of "thread", "signal", or "none".
Immediately following the slash is either the string "tid" for timers
with
.B SIGEV_THREAD_ID
notification, or "pid" for timers that notify by other mechanisms.
Following the "." is the PID of the process
(or the kernel thread ID of the thread)  that will be delivered
a signal if the timer delivers notifications via a signal.
.TP
.I ClockID
This field identifies the clock that the timer uses for measuring time.
For most clocks, this is a number that matches one of the user-space
.BR CLOCK_*
constants exposed via
.IR <time.h> .
.B CLOCK_PROCESS_CPUTIME_ID
timers display with a value of -6
in this field.
.B CLOCK_THREAD_CPUTIME_ID
timers display with a value of -2
in this field.

.TP
.IR /proc/[pid]/wchan " (since Linux 2.6.0)"
The symbolic name corresponding to the location

.TP
.I /proc/apm
Advanced power management version and battery information when
.B CONFIG_APM
is defined at kernel compilation time.
.TP
.I /proc/buddyinfo
This file contains information which is used for diagnosing memory
fragmentation issues.
Each line starts with the identification of the node and the name
of the zone which together identify a memory region
This is then
followed by the count of available chunks of a certain order in
which these zones are split.
The size in bytes of a certain order is given by the formula:

    (2^order)\ *\ PAGE_SIZE

The binary buddy allocator algorithm inside the kernel will split
one chunk into two chunks of a smaller order (thus with half the
size) or combine two contiguous chunks into one larger chunk of
a higher order (thus with double the size) to satisfy allocation
requests and to counter memory fragmentation.
The order matches the column number, when starting to count at zero.

For example on a x86_64 system:

.in -12n
.nf
Node 0, zone     DMA     1    1    1    0    2    1    1    0    1    1    3
Node 0, zone   DMA32    65   47    4   81   52   28   13   10    5    1  404
Node 0, zone  Normal   216   55  189  101   84   38   37   27    5    3  587
.fi
.in

In this example, there is one node containing three zones and there
are 11 different chunk sizes.
If the page size is 4 kilobytes, then the first zone called
.I DMA
(on x86 the first 16 megabyte of memory) has 1 chunk of 4 kilobytes
(order 0) available and has 3 chunks of 4 megabytes (order 10) available.

If the memory is heavily fragmented, the counters for higher
order chunks will be zero and allocation of large contiguous areas
will fail.

Further information about the zones can be found in
.IR /proc/zoneinfo .
.TP
.I /proc/bus
Contains subdirectories for installed busses.
.TP
.I /proc/bus/pccard
Subdirectory for PCMCIA devices when

.IR "make xconfig" ,
.IR "make config" ,
or similar).
The file contents are compressed; view or search them using
.BR zcat (1)

.IR "make htmldocs"
in the root directory of the kernel source tree.)
.TP
.I /proc/cpuinfo
This is a collection of CPU and system architecture dependent items,
for each supported architecture a different list.
Two common entries are \fIprocessor\fP which gives CPU number and
\fIbogomips\fP; a system constant that is calculated
during kernel initialization.
SMP machines have information for
each CPU.
The

.I /proc/execdomains
List of the execution domains (ABI personalities).
.TP
.I /proc/fb
Frame buffer information when
.B CONFIG_FB
is defined during kernel compilation.
.TP
.I /proc/filesystems
A text listing of the filesystems which are supported by the kernel,
namely filesystems which were compiled into the kernel or whose kernel
modules are currently loaded.
(See also
.BR filesystems (5).)
If a filesystem is marked with "nodev",
this means that it does not require a block device to be mounted
(e.g., virtual filesystem, network filesystem).

Incidentally, this file may be used by
.BR mount (8)
when no filesystem is specified and it didn't manage to determine the
filesystem type.
Then filesystems contained in this file are tried
(excepted those that are marked with "nodev").
.TP
.I /proc/fs
.\" FIXME Much more needs to be said about /proc/fs

.I /proc/interrupts
This is used to record the number of interrupts per CPU per IO device.
Since Linux 2.6.24,
for the i386 and x86_64 architectures, at least, this also includes
interrupts internal to the system (that is, not associated with a device
as such), such as NMI (nonmaskable interrupt), LOC (local timer interrupt),
and for SMP systems, TLB (TLB flush interrupt), RES (rescheduling
interrupt), CAL (remote function call interrupt), and possibly others.
Very easy to read formatting, done in ASCII.

.IR /proc/kallsyms " (since Linux 2.5.71)"
This holds the kernel exported symbol definitions used by the
.BR modules (X)
tools to dynamically link and bind loadable modules.
In Linux 2.5.47 and earlier, a similar file with slightly different syntax
was named
.IR ksyms .
.TP
.I /proc/kcore
This file represents the physical memory of the system and is stored
in the ELF core file format.
With this pseudo-file, and an unstripped
kernel
.RI ( /usr/src/linux/vmlinux )
binary, GDB can be used to
examine the current state of any kernel data structures.

The total length of the file is the size of physical memory (RAM) plus
4KB.
.TP
.I /proc/kmsg
This file can be used instead of the
.BR syslog (2)
system call to read kernel messages.
A process must have superuser
privileges to read this file, and only one process should read this
file.
This file should not be read if a syslog process is running
which uses the
.BR syslog (2)
system call facility to log kernel messages.

Information in this file is retrieved with the
.BR dmesg (1)
program.
.TP
.IR /proc/kpagecount " (since Linux 2.6.25)"
This file contains a 64-bit count of the number of
times each physical page frame is mapped,
indexed by page frame number (see the discussion of
.IR /proc/[pid]/pagemap ).

The
.IR /proc/kpagecount
file is present only if the
.B CONFIG_PROC_PAGE_MONITOR
kernel configuration option is enabled.
.TP
.IR /proc/kpageflags " (since Linux 2.6.25)"
This file contains 64-bit masks corresponding to each physical page frame;

.I /proc/loadavg
The first three fields in this file are load average figures
giving the number of jobs in the run queue (state R)
or waiting for disk I/O (state D) averaged over 1, 5, and 15 minutes.
They are the same as the load average numbers given by
.BR uptime (1)
and other programs.
The fourth field consists of two numbers separated by a slash (/).
The first of these is the number of currently runnable kernel
scheduling entities (processes, threads).
The value after the slash is the number of kernel scheduling entities
that currently exist on the system.
The fifth field is the PID of the process that was most
recently created on the system.

.I /proc/meminfo
This file reports statistics about memory usage on the system.
It is used by
.BR free (1)
to report the amount of free and used memory (both physical and swap)
on the system as well as the shared memory and buffers used by the
kernel.
Each line of the file consists of a parameter name, followed by a colon,
the value of the parameter, and an option unit of measurement (e.g., "kB").
The list below describes the parameter names and
the format specifier required to read the field value.
Except as noted below,
all of the fields have been present since at least Linux 2.6.0.
Some fields are displayed only if the kernel was configured
with various options; those dependencies are noted in the list.

.TP
.IR MemTotal " %lu"
Total usable RAM (i.e., physical RAM minus a few reserved
bits and the kernel binary code).
.TP
.IR MemFree " %lu"
The sum of
.IR LowFree + HighFree .
.TP
.IR Buffers " %lu"
Relatively temporary storage for raw disk blocks that
shouldn't get tremendously large (20MB or so).
.TP
.IR Cached " %lu"
In-memory cache for files read from the disk (the page cache).
Doesn't include
.IR SwapCached .
.TP
.IR SwapCached " %lu"
Memory that once was swapped out, is swapped back in but
still also is in the swap file.
(If memory pressure is high, these pages
don't need to be swapped out again because they are already
in the swap file.
This saves I/O.)
.TP
.IR Active " %lu"
Memory that has been used more recently and usually not
reclaimed unless absolutely necessary.
.TP
.IR Inactive " %lu"
Memory which has been less recently used.
It is more eligible to be reclaimed for other purposes.

.TP
.IR HighTotal " %lu"
(Starting with Linux 2.6.19, \fBCONFIG_HIGHMEM\fP is required.)
Total amount of highmem.
Highmem is all memory above ~860MB of physical memory.
Highmem areas are for use by user-space programs,
or for the page cache.
The kernel must use tricks to access
this memory, making it slower to access than lowmem.
.TP
.IR HighFree " %lu
(Starting with Linux 2.6.19, \fBCONFIG_HIGHMEM\fP is required.)
Amount of free highmem.
.TP
.IR LowTotal " %lu
(Starting with Linux 2.6.19, \fBCONFIG_HIGHMEM\fP is required.)
Total amount of lowmem.
Lowmem is memory which can be used for everything that
highmem can be used for, but it is also available for the
kernel's use for its own data structures.
Among many other things,
it is where everything from
.I Slab
is allocated.
Bad things happen when you're out of lowmem.
.TP
.IR LowFree " %lu
(Starting with Linux 2.6.19, \fBCONFIG_HIGHMEM\fP is required.)
Amount of free lowmem.
.TP

Part of
.IR Slab ,
that cannot be reclaimed on memory pressure.
.TP
.IR KernelStack " %lu (since Linux 2.6.32)"
Amount of memory allocated to kernel stacks.
.TP
.IR PageTables " %lu (since Linux 2.6.18)"
Amount of memory dedicated to the lowest level of page tables.
.TP
.IR Quicklists " %lu (since Linux 2.6.27)"
(\fBCONFIG_QUICKLIST\fP is required.)
[To be documented.]
.TP
.IR NFS_Unstable " %lu (since Linux 2.6.18)"
NFS pages sent to the server, but not yet committed to stable storage.
.TP
.IR Bounce " %lu (since Linux 2.6.18)"
Memory used for block device "bounce buffers".
.TP
.IR WritebackTmp " %lu (since Linux 2.6.26)"
Memory used by FUSE for temporary writeback buffers.
.TP
.IR CommitLimit " %lu (since Linux 2.6.10)"
This is the total amount of memory currently available to
be allocated on the system, expressed in kilobytes.
This limit is adhered to
only if strict overcommit accounting is enabled (mode 2 in
.IR /proc/sys/vm/overcommit_memory ).
The limit is calculated according to the formula described under
.IR /proc/sys/vm/overcommit_memory .
For further details, see the kernel source file
.IR Documentation/vm/overcommit-accounting .
.TP
.IR Committed_AS " %lu"
The amount of memory presently allocated on the system.
The committed memory is a sum of all of the memory which
has been allocated by processes, even if it has not been
"used" by them as of yet.
A process which allocates 1GB of memory (using
.BR malloc (3)
or similar), but touches only 300MB of that memory will show up
as using only 300MB of memory even if it has the address space
allocated for the entire 1GB.

This 1GB is memory which has been "committed" to by the VM
and can be used at any time by the allocating application.
With strict overcommit enabled on the system (mode 2 in
IR /proc/sys/vm/overcommit_memory ),
allocations which would exceed the
.I CommitLimit
will not be permitted.
This is useful if one needs to guarantee that processes will not
fail due to lack of memory once that memory has been successfully allocated.
.TP
.IR VmallocTotal " %lu"
Total size of vmalloc memory area.
.TP
.IR VmallocUsed " %lu"
Amount of vmalloc area which is used.
.TP
.IR VmallocChunk " %lu"
Largest contiguous block of vmalloc area which is free.

.TP
.IR AnonHugePages " %lu (since Linux 2.6.38)"
(\fBCONFIG_TRANSPARENT_HUGEPAGE\fP is required.)
Non-file backed huge pages mapped into user-space page tables.
.TP
.IR HugePages_Total " %lu"
(\fBCONFIG_HUGETLB_PAGE\fP is required.)
The size of the pool of huge pages.
.TP
.IR HugePages_Free " %lu"
(\fBCONFIG_HUGETLB_PAGE\fP is required.)
The number of huge pages in the pool that are not yet allocated.
.TP
.IR HugePages_Rsvd " %lu (since Linux 2.6.17)"
(\fBCONFIG_HUGETLB_PAGE\fP is required.)
This is the number of huge pages for
which a commitment to allocate from the pool has been made,
but no allocation has yet been made.
These reserved huge pages
guarantee that an application will be able to allocate a
huge page from the pool of huge pages at fault time.
.TP
.IR HugePages_Surp " %lu (since Linux 2.6.24)"
(\fBCONFIG_HUGETLB_PAGE\fP is required.)
This is the number of huge pages in
the pool above the value in
.IR /proc/sys/vm/nr_hugepages .
The maximum number of surplus huge pages is controlled by
.IR /proc/sys/vm/nr_overcommit_hugepages .
.TP
.IR Hugepagesize " %lu"
(\fBCONFIG_HUGETLB_PAGE\fP is required.)
The size of huge pages.

.TP
.I /proc/mounts
Before kernel 2.4.19, this file was a list
of all the filesystems currently mounted on the system.
With the introduction of per-process mount namespaces in
Linux 2.4.19, this file became a link to
.IR /proc/self/mounts ,
which lists the mount points of the process's own mount namespace.
The format of this file is documented in
.BR fstab (5).
.TP
.I /proc/mtrr
Memory Type Range Registers.
See the Linux kernel source file
.I Documentation/mtrr.txt
for details.
.TP
.I /proc/net
various net pseudo-files, all of which give the status of some part of
the networking layer.
These files contain ASCII structures and are,
therefore, readable with
.BR cat (1).
However, the standard
.BR netstat (8)
suite provides much cleaner access to these files.
.TP
.I /proc/net/arp
This holds an ASCII readable dump of the kernel ARP table used for
address resolutions.
It will show both dynamically learned and preprogrammed ARP entries.
The format is:

.nf
.ft CW
.in 8n
IP address     HW type   Flags     HW address          Mask   Device
192.168.0.50   0x1       0x2       00:50:BF:25:68:F3   *      eth0
192.168.0.250  0x1       0xc       00:00:00:00:00:00   *      eth0
.ft
.fi
.in

Here "IP address" is the IPv4 address of the machine and the "HW type"
is the hardware type of the address from RFC\ 826.
The flags are the internal
flags of the ARP structure (as defined in
.IR /usr/include/linux/if_arp.h )
and
the "HW address" is the data link layer mapping for that IP address if
it is known.
.TP
.I /proc/net/dev
The dev pseudo-file contains network device status information.
This gives
the number of received and sent packets, the number of errors and
collisions
and other basic statistics.
These are used by the
.BR ifconfig (8)
program to report device status.
The format is:

These directories show up for all drivers that registered at least one
SCSI HBA.
Every directory contains one file per registered host.
Every host-file is named after the number the host was assigned during

If the number of allocated file handles is close to the

Before Linux 2.6,
the kernel allocated file handles dynamically,
but it didn't free them again.
Instead the free file handles were kept in a list for reallocation;
the "free file handles" value indicates the size of that list.
A large number of free file handles indicates that there was

The default value in this file is 0.
Setting the value to 1
prevents a longstanding class of security issues caused by
hard-link-based time-of-check, time-of-use races,
most commonly seen in world-writable directories such as
.IR /tmp .
The common method of exploiting this flaw
is to cross privilege boundaries when following a given hard link
(i.e., a root process follows a hard link created by another user).
Additionally, on systems without separated partitions,
this stops unauthorized users from "pinning" vulnerable set-user-ID and
set-group-ID files against being upgraded by
the administrator, or linking to special files.

.RS
.TP
\fI0\ (default)\fP
This provides the traditional (pre-Linux 2.6.13) behavior.
A core dump will not be produced for a process which has
changed credentials (by calling
.BR seteuid (2),
.BR setgid (2),
or similar, or by executing a set-user-ID or set-group-ID program)
or whose binary does not have read permission enabled.
.TP
\fI1\ ("debug")\fP
All processes dump core when possible.
The core dump is owned by the filesystem user ID of the dumping process
and no security is applied.
This is intended for system debugging situations only.
Ptrace is unchecked.
.TP
\fI2\ ("suidsafe")\fP
Any binary which normally would not be dumped (see "0" above)
is dumped readable by root only.
This allows the user to remove the core dump file but not to read it.
For security reasons core dumps in this mode will not overwrite one
another or other files.
This mode is appropriate when administrators are
attempting to debug problems in a normal environment.

.IR /proc/sys/vm/drop_caches " (since Linux 2.6.16)"
Writing to this file causes the kernel to drop clean caches, dentries, and
inodes from memory, causing that memory to become free.
This can be useful for memory management testing and
performing reproducible filesystem benchmarks.
Because writing to this file causes the benefits of caching to be lost,
it can degrade overall system performance.

To free pagecache, use:

    echo 1 > /proc/sys/vm/drop_caches

To free dentries and inodes, use:

    echo 2 > /proc/sys/vm/drop_caches

To free pagecache, dentries and inodes, use:

    echo 3 > /proc/sys/vm/drop_caches

Because writing to this file is a nondestructive operation and dirty objects
are not freeable, the
user should run
.BR sync (1)
first.

.IR /proc/sys/vm/memory_failure_early_kill " (since Linux 2.6.32)"
.\" The following is based on the text in Documentation/sysctl/vm.txt
Control how to kill processes when an uncorrected memory error
(typically a 2-bit error in a memory module)
that cannot be handled by the kernel
is detected in the background by hardware.
In some cases (like the page still having a valid copy on disk),
the kernel will handle the failure
transparently without affecting any applications.
But if there is no other up-to-date copy of the data,
it will kill processes to prevent any data corruptions from propagating.

The file has one of the following values:
.RS
.IP 1: 4
Kill all processes that have the corrupted-and-not-reloadable page mapped
as soon as the corruption is detected.
Note this is not supported for a few types of pages, like kernel internally
allocated data or the swap cache, but works for the majority of user pages.
.IP 0: 4
Only unmap the corrupted page from all processes and kill only a process
that tries to access it.
.RE
.IP
The kill is performed using a
.B SIGBUS
signal with
.I si_code
set to
.BR BUS_MCEERR_AO .
Processes can handle this if they want to; see
.BR sigaction (2)
for more details.

This feature is active only on architectures/platforms with advanced machine
check handling and depends on the hardware capabilities.

.IR /proc/sys/vm/oom_dump_tasks " (since Linux 2.6.25)"
.\" The following is from Documentation/sysctl/vm.txt
Enables a system-wide task dump (excluding kernel threads) to be
produced when the kernel performs an OOM-killing.
The dump includes the following information
for each task (thread, process):
thread ID, real user ID, thread group ID (process ID),
virtual memory size, resident set size,
the CPU that the task is scheduled on,
oom_adj score (see the description of
.IR /proc/[pid]/oom_adj ),
and command name.
This is helpful to determine why the OOM-killer was invoked
and to identify the rogue task that caused it.

If this contains the value zero, this information is suppressed.
On very large systems with thousands of tasks,
it may not be feasible to dump the memory state information for each one.
Such systems should not be forced to incur a performance penalty in
OOM situations when the information may not be desired.

If this is set to nonzero, this information is shown whenever the
OOM-killer actually kills a memory-hogging task.

The default value is 0.
.TP
.IR /proc/sys/vm/oom_kill_allocating_task " (since Linux 2.6.24)"
.\" The following is from Documentation/sysctl/vm.txt
This enables or disables killing the OOM-triggering task in
out-of-memory situations.

If this is set to zero, the OOM-killer will scan through the entire
tasklist and select a task based on heuristics to kill.
This normally selects a rogue memory-hogging task that
frees up a large amount of memory when killed.

If this is set to nonzero, the OOM-killer simply kills the task that
triggered the out-of-memory condition.
This avoids a possibly expensive tasklist scan.

If
.I /proc/sys/vm/panic_on_oom
is nonzero, it takes precedence over whatever value is used in
.IR /proc/sys/vm/oom_kill_allocating_task .

The default value is 0.

.IR /proc/sys/vm/overcommit_kbytes " (since Linux 3.14)"
.\" commit 49f0ce5f92321cdcf741e35f385669a421013cb7
This writable file provides an alternative to
.IR /proc/sys/vm/overcommit_ratio
for controlling the
.I CommitLimit
when
.IR /proc/sys/vm/overcommit_memory
has the value 2.
It allows the amount of memory overcommitting to be specified as
an absolute value (in kB),
rather than as a percentage, as is done with
.IR overcommit_ratio .
This allows for finer-grained control of
.IR CommitLimit
on systems with extremely large memory sizes.

Only one of
.IR overcommit_kbytes
or
.IR overcommit_ratio
can have an effect:
if
.IR overcommit_kbytes
has a nonzero value, then it is used to calculate
.IR CommitLimit ,
otherwise
.IR overcommit_ratio
is used.
Writing a value to either of these files causes the
value in the other file to be set to zero.
.TP
.I /proc/sys/vm/overcommit_memory
This file contains the kernel virtual memory accounting mode.
Values are:
.RS
.IP
0: heuristic overcommit (this is the default)
.br
1: always overcommit, never check
.br
2: always check, never overcommit
.RE
.IP
In mode 0, calls of
.BR mmap (2)
with
.B MAP_NORESERVE
are not checked, and the default check is very weak,
leading to the risk of getting a process "OOM-killed".
Under Linux 2.4, any nonzero value implies mode 1.

In mode 2 (available since Linux 2.6), the total virtual address space
that can be allocated
.RI ( CommitLimit
in
.IR /proc/meminfo )
is calculated as

    CommitLimit = (total_RAM - total_huge_TLB) *
                  overcommit_ratio / 100 + total_swap

where:
.RS 12
.IP * 3
.I total_RAM
is the total amount of RAM on the system;
.IP *
.I total_huge_TLB
is the amount of memory set aside for huge pages;
.IP *
.I overcommit_ratio
is the value in
.IR /proc/sys/vm/overcommit_ratio ;
and
.IP *
.I total_swap
is the amount of swap space.
.RE
.IP
For example, on a system with 16GB of physical RAM, 16GB
of swap, no space dedicated to huge pages, and an
.I overcommit_ratio
of 50, this formula yields a
.I CommitLimit
of 24GB.

Since Linux 3.14, if the value in
.I /proc/sys/vm/overcommit_kbytes
is nonzero, then
.I CommitLimit
is instead calculated as:

    CommitLimit = overcommit_kbytes + total_swap
.TP
.IR /proc/sys/vm/overcommit_ratio " (since Linux 2.6.0)"

.TP
.IR /proc/sys/vm/panic_on_oom " (since Linux 2.6.18)"
.\" The following is adapted from Documentation/sysctl/vm.txt
This enables or disables a kernel panic in
an out-of-memory situation.

If this file is set to the value 0,
the kernel's OOM-killer will kill some rogue process.
Usually, the OOM-killer is able to kill a rogue process and the
system will survive.

If this file is set to the value 1,
then the kernel normally panics when out-of-memory happens.
However, if a process limits allocations to certain nodes
using memory policies
.RB ( mbind (2)
.BR MPOL_BIND )
or cpusets
.RB ( cpuset (7))
and those nodes reach memory exhaustion status,
one process may be killed by the OOM-killer.
No panic occurs in this case:
because other nodes' memory may be free,
this means the system as a whole may not have reached
an out-of-memory situation yet.

If this file is set to the value 2,
the kernel always panics when an out-of-memory condition occurs.

The default value is 0.
1 and 2 are for failover of clustering.
Select either according to your policy of failover.
.TP
.IR /proc/sys/vm/swappiness

.\"	Date:   Fri Feb 16 01:28:13 2007 -0800
.\" Text largely derived from Documentation/timers/timer_stats.txt
This is a debugging facility to make timer (ab)use in a Linux
system visible to kernel and user-space developers.
It can be used by kernel and user-space developers to verify that
their code does not make undue use of timers.
The goal is to avoid unnecessary wakeups,
thereby optimizing power consumption.

If enabled in the kernel
.RB ( CONFIG_TIMER_STATS ),
but not used,
it has almost zero runtime overhead and a relatively small
data-structure overhead.
Even if collection is enabled at runtime, overhead is low:
all the locking is per-CPU and lookup is hashed.

The
.I /proc/timer_stats
file is used both to control sampling facility and to read out the
sampled information.

The timer_stats functionality is inactive on bootup.
A sampling period can be started using the following command:

    # echo 1 > /proc/timer_stats

The following command stops a sampling period:

    # echo 0 > /proc/timer_stats

The statistics can be retrieved by:

    $ cat /proc/timer_stats

While sampling is enabled, each readout from
.I /proc/timer_stats
will see
newly updated statistics.
Once sampling is disabled, the sampled information
is kept until a new sample period is started.
This allows multiple readouts.

.IR /proc/timer_stats :

.SH NOTES
Many strings (i.e., the environment and command line) are in
the internal format, with subfields terminated by null bytes (\(aq\\0\(aq),
so you
may find that things are more readable if you use \fIod \-c\fP or \fItr
"\\000" "\\n"\fP to read them.
Alternatively, \fIecho \`cat <file>\`\fP works well.

This manual page is incomplete, possibly inaccurate, and is the kind
