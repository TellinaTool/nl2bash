 abstract = {This paper talks about the struggle novice programmers have to interact with system command language.  Few operating systems are moving from system command language to natural language, which making novices’ programmer more productive.  Using natural language in all operating systems helps programmer making transaction from one operating system to another very smoothly, and learning curve is minimal.},
