This package contains the GIZA++ toolkit and the mkcls tool, originally
written by F.J. Och and several other authors.

UPDATE 4th April 2015, by Hieu Hoang:

Works with most versions of gcc, including really old versions. Doesn't work with recent versions of clang.

Why not try using mgiza? It's multi-threaded and kept up to date to work with most compilers
